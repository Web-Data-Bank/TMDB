The purpose of the expedition was to prove Heyerdal's theory that the Polynesian Islands were populated from the east- specifically Peru- rather than from the west (Asia) as had been the theory for hundreds of years. Heyerdahl made a study of the winds and tides in the Pacific, and by simulating conditions as closely as possible to those he theorized the Peruvians encountered, set out on the voyage.","popularity":2.829,"poster_path":"/oGdy7EkyQ9LCpuLptEII5kwjB5r.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145368,"logo_path":null,"name":"Syncron-film AS","origin_country":""},{"id":6181,"logo_path":"/eaQ7or8IoEmPfgmQiU2C5lVZkxS.png","name":"SF Studios","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"1950-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Amazing Adventure Of Six Men On A Raft Across The Pacific!
