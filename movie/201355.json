Danny Lee was just at the beginning of his extraordinarily diverse career when he led Liu Lu-hua and Liu Shang-chien on an ever-challenging, sometimes frustrating but always funny, pursuit of the lovely Hsiao Yao, sexy Niu Niu, and sweet Chen Szu-chia. This bright, entertaining film proves that the road to true love may not be smooth, but it is always worth traveling… and enjoying.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2OfHryJxvfFxh5M325YDTxuaL5f.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5798,"logo_path":"/tmuI9BGXgpWLmokhlxpnG3IGNQB.png","name":"Shaw Brothers","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"1978-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Melody of Love","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
