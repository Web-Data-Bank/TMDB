With a weird stroke of luck, Holly succeeds, but is unaware that \"Samantha\" really appears only with the help of an illegal, secret military computer program. The program uses the imagination of a real person to create a total virtual reality environment. At the club, the MC introduces Holly with the line, \"Welcome to the Imagination of Holly Moon.\" A fantastic environment and performance unfolds from within the subject's own lofty aspirations.
