The story focuses on three brothers and how they respond to the expectation that they will each marry women whom their grandfather has selected for them. The lure of family money on the one hand and modern individualism on the other plays out differently among the young men. Critics consider this movie an indictment against feudal ideas.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1OqpCg5xE0A2Kit9k6Zs1b3hwJ8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1078,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shanghai Film Studio","origin_country":"CN"},{"id":3406,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ningxia Film Studio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"1957-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Family","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1}
