But first they have to get there, and the train conductor won't let the ostrich board. Porky sneaks her on. She gets loose and eats a sleeping woman's wig, a boy's toy airplane, and a concertina. Porky hides her in a guitar case, but she gets out as the conductor comes by, and they are both thrown off. They enlist a hand cart and a cow to outrun the train.","popularity":0.771,"poster_path":"/yR7g49CEt22paTjFts1ZWwpZ5EA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1936-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Porky's Pet","video":false,"vote_average":5.75,"vote_count":6}
