The film takes us from jazz-festival to jazz-festival. There he plays his impressive and rare collections of records, mostly for himself and with some disregard for his audience. Jules Deelder provides us with an interesting view on jazz when it was at its popularity peak. This is inter-cut with interviews of his closest friends, colleagues, musicians and contemporary poets. The essence of Jules Deelder, a man of many words but one whom is hard to understand/grasp, is best captured in the dramatically styled 8mm black an white footage used in the film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wOWxM3PwL9JXRuom5MAC2yHkv8r.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jules Deelder: Jazz Is My Religion","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
