(This opulence is largely due to the work of cinematographer Zhu Jinming, the master visual stylist of Shangrao Concentration Camp and other key \"Seventeen Years\" films.) The film concerns a hard-boiled woman working in the Chongqing Communist underground during World War II, whose commitment to the guerrilla cause is only intensified after she witnesses her husband's head mounted on the city walls by the Nationalist forces.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mQuLqmvXYctu4Jnp5ysiVpVQnCf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":708,"logo_path":null,"name":"Beijing Film Studio","origin_country":"CN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"1965-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":138,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Red Crag","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
