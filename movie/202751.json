It is a personal journey through image and time. It is the portrait of the \"La Matriz\" neighborhood in Valparaíso. It is the encounter between reality and fiction. It is the constant search to find a truth within the documentary. It is a musical rehearsal. It is the constant preparation of a documentary. It is a documentary of questions more than answers. A silent face, an empty road, a winter landscape, the wind moving the leaves of a tree, a wall, the sea, the street of a neighborhood, all of them intend to \"create through the record\" a unique truth for each viewer.","popularity":1.371,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2003-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Place in Anywhere","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
