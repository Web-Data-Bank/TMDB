As Tiago (Rogério Samora) drives his master (André Gomes) through the Portuguese countryside to an unspecified destination, the traveling pair embark on a series of highly philosophical discussions. Flowing with tales of his life in the military and previous sexual escapades, Tiago trades a series of tales with his rapt passenger, including the story of a vengeful spurned lover who plots revenge on the nobleman who rejected her by transforming a prostitute into a society lady and convincing him to marry the tainted bride.","popularity":0.763,"poster_path":"/zCsbX1HW49VZW6XHu8IjArgZ3PB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16418,"logo_path":null,"name":"Instituto do Cinema, Audiovisual e Multimédia (ICAM)","origin_country":"PT"},{"id":11143,"logo_path":null,"name":"Madragoa Filmes","origin_country":"PT"},{"id":6584,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gemini Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2005-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fatalist","video":false,"vote_average":3.4,"vote_count":5}
