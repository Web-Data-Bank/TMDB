Tracing back the scammers’ stories to the times of Ghanaian independence, the film proposes Sakawa as a form of anti-neocolonial resistance. The film takes the form of a voyage to the end of the world, travelling through a network of digitised mine shafts that lead the viewer to each of the film’s locations; a gold mine, an e-waste dump, a voodoo ritual or a discotheque for example. A character recounts a story through reading a series of letters that he has written to the film’s author – letters that speak about the colonial history of Ghana, of gold, of technology.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lettres du voyant","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
