An attractive student (Dominika Ostalowska) puts the teacher in an awkward spot when she reveals her love for him. An 11-year-old (Karolina Ostrozna) informs the priest that she's his daughter. The army officer is pleased when confronted by a past lover (Irina Alfiorowa). The drug dealer, taken prisoner, must decide whether or not to trust his wife (Katarzyna Figura) with his hidden loot. In the wrap-up, the elderly accountant (Jerzy Nowak) passes judgment on all four men. Stuhr acted in films by the late Krzysztof Kieslowski, who had some input here by offering advice to Stuhr on this screenplay. Shown at the 1997 Venice Film Festival, this film is also known as Love Stories.","popularity":0.874,"poster_path":"/r18hyl7sbn25q6AxAvCR6tS5L2a.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-06-27","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love Stories","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":9}
