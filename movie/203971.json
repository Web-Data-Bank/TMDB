Her husband is an unimaginative, work-obsessed man who cannot see that her constant hard work without any support or sympathy from anyone is driving the sensitive woman to consider suicide. When the loutish fellow discovers that his wife and three children are missing, he calls the police, and a manhunt begins. The police discover the oldest boy alive, and find that the mother tried to drown herself, but has survived. The two younger children remained missing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hDILKxXXkKGYyN5bYdBlsGIzyr1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94386,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kinofinlandia Oy","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"1992-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Well","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":4}
