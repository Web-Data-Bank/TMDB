Instead, they end up sleeping on the streets until they have a chance at earning a little income -- a man has asked them to take his herd of pigs across a fast-moving river. The current is dangerous, and worse, the wife is pregnant and this would not be an easy task even if she were not. Undaunted and desperate, the couple accept the job and enter the river to face their destiny.","popularity":0.648,"poster_path":"/AmeY8AFKvFjg3tHQ6LQrWHhUxm5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80079,"logo_path":null,"name":"Orchid Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1984-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":141,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Crossing","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":7}
