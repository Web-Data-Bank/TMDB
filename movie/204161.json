When German artist Bernd Hoffmann (Michael König) arrives in Lisbon to oversee the installation of his paintings in a joint exhibition with another Berlin artist, Hanna Brauer (Charlotte Schwab), Hanna never shows up. Hoffmann is puzzled because he is certain he saw a video sequence with Hanna at the exhibition, and he begins to look for her. Another Lisbon cultural center, a theater, is also having problems that may or may not be related -- and the mystery deepens when Hanna is found dead, either by her own hand, or murdered.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":18888,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films du Passage","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"1985-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ninguém Duas Vezes","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":4}
