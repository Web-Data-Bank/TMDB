Their love for each other is verboten in Finland, where the Germans occupy northern Lapland until the end of the war. Finland had formed a brief alliance with Germany to fight an invading Russia in the winter of 1939, but when the Russians won that battle and took more than 16,000 square miles of land away from Finland, it was too late to successfully rout the Germans from Finnish soil. So for the entire war, the Finns were fighting Germany on their own national territory -- which makes the love affair between a Finnish nurse and German soldier a very complex issue. While Angela receives different reactions from her friends, acquaintances, and relatives, she continues on with her love for the German, against odds which are greater as time goes by.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/573IhLVZh5aAt2Ry0s5TQKARxoH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17644,"logo_path":null,"name":"JÃ¶rn Donner Productions","origin_country":"FI"},{"id":157,"logo_path":"/s537keIoi6wUOU8E9ztWaV2DY1H.png","name":"SVT Drama","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"1984-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Angela's War","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
