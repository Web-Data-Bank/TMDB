The story concerns math professor Robert Powell, who feels that there is something lacking in his ever-so-precise life. What is missing is truth, specifically philosophical truth. Thus he philosophizes at great length, allowing director Zanussi plenty of room for didactic but little room for warmth. Leading ladies Brigette Fossey and Leslie Caron occasionally melt through the cold logic of Imperative.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bLtthm96G9RhJhJVEzjKXgkWUAc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27899,"logo_path":null,"name":"Telefilm Saar","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":23983,"logo_path":"/mwdVAta6xcY8eCpL5t8KKc96BWm.png","name":"SR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1982-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Imperative","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4}
