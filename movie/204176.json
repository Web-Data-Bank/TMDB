He returns to his hometown where he was accused of turning a Jewish druggist and the druggist's wife over to the Nazis. With his friends following him, Kerekes tries to find out what became of the couple after they were deported. After being subjected to a mock trial by his friends -- and found guilty -- Kerekes becomes despondent and attempts to kill himself. Flashbacks and hallucinations are employed to tell this story that occurs during the Eichmann trial. Both the film and Antal Pager gained some unwanted publicity when a Variety article from April 23rd, 1967 accused Pager of being a Nazi collaborator for his role in an anti-Semitic film during World War II.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yFbTil7gSUfueTbv3rjq9Hhigge.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8100,"logo_path":"/1HuVRo0SYPSzYvduxVf4baaWqOI.png","name":"Mafilm","origin_country":"HU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"1967-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":119,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Late Season","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1}
