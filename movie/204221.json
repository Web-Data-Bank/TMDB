Persecution, loneliness, adults’ hostility, fear, mixture of obstinacy and tenderness, and even an imprisonment. Excellent camera movement and delicate portraying of Ciske’s fragile soul put this film out of merely historical context and ensure its place in the history of great cinema.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/AfSTIhT7MhMGHqrRHc8mEA3WARu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109886,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmproduktiemaatschappij Amsterdam","origin_country":""},{"id":10688,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmtrust","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1955-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ciske the Rat","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":6}
