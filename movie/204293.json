The feature focuses exclusively on the youth of Chopin (who died at age 39), spanning his 15th year (c. 1825) through his 21st year (c. 1831); it also depicts Chopin as both prodigiously gifted and one filled with a tremendous spirit of Polish nationalism. Ford concludes with the onset of the illness that eventually killed Ford, set against the backdrop of the famous November Uprising in 1830.","popularity":1.081,"poster_path":"/osm8eLsylELI38n7aMZspUQrAYf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1587,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Polski","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1952-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Young Chopin","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
