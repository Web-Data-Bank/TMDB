The material turns out to be too incohesive and abundant to work into a pointed, thematic article, and just when he is about to give up, his younger brother asks him a simple question: \"How many coal burners are there in Calcutta?\" This triggers an idea for a story about Calcutta's pollution -- and the aspiring journalist dreams of myriads of burner-toting citizens invading the publisher's home demanding redress. Maybe he is finally on the way to a story that matters.","popularity":0.961,"poster_path":"/4aot5euJEeESZJdevmuwuFWuGJi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1981-01-07","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kaleidoscope","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4}
