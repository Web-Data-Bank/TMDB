When John accidentally discovers a hidden compartment in the barn, he finds a creepy scarecrow but his son Michael makes him promise to destroy it. However, his neighbor Jude Weatherby visits him, gives a six-pack of beer to the abstemious John and convinces him to put the scarecrow in the cornfield. Out of the blue, the life of John changes: the crows die; the pump works again irrigating the land; and the banker responsible for the closure has an accident and dies. However, he feels that his land is possessed by something evil that is threatening his beloved family.","popularity":16.243,"poster_path":"/xav4wnkLQiVAUTVxNPMKrXTBdkf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":768,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ghost House Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Beginning Of The End","title":"Messengers 2: The Scarecrow","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":137}
