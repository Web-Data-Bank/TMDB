The film is based on a true story, wherein an France airliner managed to survive a journey from Rio De Janeiro to Dakar with two of its engines incapacitated. To this already intensely dramatic situation has been added a romantic subplot involving Claire Magny (Michele Morgan) and Jacques Forester (Jean Marais). The love story adds very little to the film; fortunately, neither does it detract from the film's overall quality. As was the case with many French productions of the 1940s, Aux Yeux du Souvenir benefits immeasurably from the Wagnerian musical score by Georges Auric.","popularity":0.637,"poster_path":"/6xf9cfEo62uwh1wGIwp9d5iDZqr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22358,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Gibé","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1948-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Eyes of Memory","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":7}
