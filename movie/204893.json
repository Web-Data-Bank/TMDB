His young and impulsive lover, Waldo, flees to Manila in disgust. After a month of hesitation, Joaquin leaves his wife to follow Waldo. His search takes him on a seamy yet colorful trip through Manila's gay underbelly. He discovers Waldo's dangerous flirtation with Rufo, a bisexual rogue cop who holds the clue to Waldo's disappearance. Rufo lures Joaquin into his home and introduces him to his submissive wife, Beng. A sadist who beats up Beng regularly, Rufo turns Joaquin into a prisoner and sex slave as he did to Waldo. When Joaquin is finally reunited with Waldo, he discovers that Rufo is about to sell them like fish to an international sex trafficking ring, along with his personal harem of male and female captives.","popularity":1.452,"poster_path":"/whFbrC3QZZUi96WuArIKw5WeYwL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37558,"logo_path":null,"name":"DMV Entertainment","origin_country":"PH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2008-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Way Out","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":8}
