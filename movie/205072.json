It was a double performance where parts engraved directly on Â±\r 16mm black film are inserted on a background made with the help of a live mixing software. The film is based, on the one hand, on a process of condensation and densification of the original footage of the performance that serves as a departure for interventions that intensify its energetic potentialities.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Triptych - 2","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
