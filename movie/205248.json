Wildwood, NJ moves beyond gum-cracking, big hair, and press-on nails to look into the souls of women raised on the boardwalks rides and beaches. A Wildwood honeymoon, virginity lost to a boardwalk stranger, fistfights, madness, babies, and no matter what, returning to Wildwood year after year as they grow up and grow old.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":155488,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ruthless Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wildwood, NJ","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":9}
