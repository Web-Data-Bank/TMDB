Narrated by Anthony LaPaglia.  After the disaster of World War II, a wave of Italian immigrants found their way to Melbourne - a strange place, suspicious of outsiders and completely devoid of a good cup of espresso. Congregating in a then run-down stretch of Carlton known as Lygon Street, these irrepressible restaurateurs, entrepreneurs and sometime mafiosi would come to define not only a street, but an entire country.  'Lygon Street - Si parla Italiano' brings to life the people, places and, of course, pastas that have made up one of Australia's most remarkable communities.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2013-08-03","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Food, wine, coffee...and a little bit of gambling","title":"Lygon Street - Si parla Italiano","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
