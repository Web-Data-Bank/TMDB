When sexy Elke gives him the eye, he leaves the actress in the lurch and joins the gang for a decadent party aboard a yacht. However, Elke's wanton ways and Olivier's inexperience do not mesh, and in a snit, he accidentally sets the yacht afire. The gang wreaks its vengeance by luring him into a dangerous contest of bravura on a construction site.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eXwGtGP8OE1FuZuXHYHhlO0sXdU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19101,"logo_path":null,"name":"Contact Organisation","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":19102,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paris Interproductions (PIP)","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1962-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sweet Ecstasy","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3}
