Assumed to be a man because of the name, Freddy creates a sensation appearing at a dance in the newest creation from Paris, and later incurs the ire of all when she accidentally causes a stampede. Ranch foreman Bruce Elwood (Arnold Gray) eventually wins the heart of the leading lady when he rescues Freddy from a villainous cattle rustler. A year after this light comedy, Dean began to wind down her career, and played a foil to Laurel and Hardy in Slipping Wives.","popularity":1.091,"poster_path":"/smGSOMCnXRmP9YCp7mHzkJLiU16.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1926-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"West of Broadway","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
