Although Jack cannot read the minds of other dogs, he still operates a canine mind-reading business, without divulging his inability to customers. Mr. Mooney and his wife bring their dog to see Jack. Dissatisfied with Jack's inability to read his dog's mind, Mr. Mooney, who is a friend of the city mayor, threatens to have his business closed down. After the Mooneys leave, a wealthy man named Clyde Windsor brings his dog, Lucky, to see Jack, who is stunned by his ability to read the dog's mind. He seems worried by this fact and ends the session early. Before Windsor leaves, Jack informs him that Lucky is bothered by three individuals that live with him.","popularity":1.902,"poster_path":"/14gtKiG3Xf2J3hziQVHHLVAg2Kx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20986,"logo_path":null,"name":"Finnegan/Pinchuk Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":670,"logo_path":"/obxQN2KRHJLMRNohpeQ4zRJT0F1.png","name":"Disney Branded Television","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1998-06-27","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You Lucky Dog","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":19}
