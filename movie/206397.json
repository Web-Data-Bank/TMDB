Offered a business license and asked to join the Chamber of Commerce, Lynch opened and maintained his business according to the most rigorous standards available. However, marijuana remains a Class 1 narcotic according to the DEA, and Lynch's business soon became the target of a large Federal investigation. This film explores the horrific descent into hell faced by Mr. Lynch - previously a law abiding citizen without so much as a speeding ticket, as he is cast as a Pablo Escobar and thrown into Federal detention.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lynching Charlie Lynch","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":2}
