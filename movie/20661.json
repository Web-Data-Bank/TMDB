Bjorn and Erik are close friends. Bjorn is pursued by Kirsten, a future Stepford wife, but he falls for Anna, who initiates him into love and sex. Erik is somber, caring for his home-bound mentally-ill mother while his strict father rules his life. He desires Kirsten, but she's unattainable. Pregnancy, a horrific abortion, an engagement party, and a revelation about the rectitude of Erik's father lead to a climax: Bjorn and Erik must stand up to controlling adults.","popularity":1.554,"poster_path":"/A48OZzENAcxkl7GVDg1OWawHCRN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":49374,"logo_path":null,"name":"Palle Fogtdal A/S","origin_country":""},{"id":8229,"logo_path":null,"name":"Per Holst Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"1984-12-26","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Twist and Shout","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":16}
