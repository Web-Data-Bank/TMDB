There were improvements in the graphics, a more complicated storyline, and lots of new, tasteless humour. Many consider this to be the funniest of the old episodes, although Pirk's excessive swearing did raise a few eyebrows back int he day... Star Wreck III saw the first of the now traditional red-shirted security guard jokes.  Having wrecked his ship in the previous episode, Pirk now commands a brand new starship, and is sent to investigate a Romuclan attack plan on a backwater space station. It all ends with the most massive space battle in the history of the P-fleet, and it's lead by Pirk... With odds like that, does humanity stand a chance?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3lL0u7yO2qS9xiRpTz48X7CBnPH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5760,"logo_path":null,"name":"Energia Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"1994-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Star Wreck III: The Wrath of the Romuclans","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":5}
