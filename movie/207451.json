Mooch's big brother Wilbert 'Wilby' is smart, shy and a promising inventor, but hopelessly clumsy when it comes to girls, and is jealous of his slick mate Trey who has no problems. Desperate Wilby resorts to a spell from the ring of Lucrezia Borgia (he accidentally got from dad's museum of curiosities), which magically turns him into Bundles and back at uncontrollable times. This is how he also knows that the diamond on loan in his father's museum is Charlie's next target.","popularity":1.538,"poster_path":"/AaHZtm07jcyeUL31cjHOEoG9Ty6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15943,"logo_path":null,"name":"ZM Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":670,"logo_path":"/obxQN2KRHJLMRNohpeQ4zRJT0F1.png","name":"Disney Branded Television","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1994-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Shaggy Dog","video":false,"vote_average":4.9,"vote_count":14}
