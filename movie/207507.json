In the first day he feels alone and frail; in the second day what was supposed to be pleasant becomes a nightmare; in the third day he finally achieves fulfillment through music and helps a pianist (Vera Holtz) who is rehearsing for a concert. These three days correspond to a three movement sonata - the director (Lina Chamie) is a musician, so she imprinted a musical structure to her movie, with few dialogs and poetic images. It's a movie for music lovers.
