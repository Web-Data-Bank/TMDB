Ferocious editing sarcastically juxtaposes these good intentions with the political farce of speeches and parades, all to the tune of factory chimneys collapsing in slow motion and the exhumed body of an “unknown soldier”. —cinematek.be","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/PlNdhh18bSOba1FzIg9LPwP6dA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89685,"logo_path":null,"name":"Films Henri Storck","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"1932-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Story of the Unknown Soldier","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":3}
