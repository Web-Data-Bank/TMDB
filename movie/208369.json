The butlers prepare they party and contribute to the ethnographic heritage, starting a ritual of emancipation where we can see confrontations with the force of the bull. Several men wear a rudimentary object made of wood, and fight the bulls that are brought in, often from Spain. The villages compete against each other in search of the Best Capeia of the Year.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vawDJOhA9Md2pxyBQBIdvfZGcmT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125460,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vo'Arte","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2010-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Há Tourada na Aldeia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
