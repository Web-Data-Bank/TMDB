He focuses on Chongqingâ€“a city in Sichuan Province with a burgeoning population and big plans for the future. While peasants in outlying areas eke out a meager living, the rising middle class revels in new riches, challenging traditional ideas about religion, sexuality, and consumerism. All this reverberates here in America, where companies scramble for cheap labor, workers find jobs shipped overseas, and shoppers snap up Chinese-made goods at big box retailers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9maYn2hLo02DAEkp6zO4YiJTs4k.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"People's Republic of Capitalism","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
