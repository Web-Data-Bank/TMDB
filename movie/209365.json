Armed with an ax and a buckshot-shooting pistol, the two of them interrupt Ted Fiorito and his jazz orchestra (and showgirls). The lads head for the woods, where Ted convinces them to stand their ground. They're joined by their songstress who says it may be their last day on earth, so sing the blues for all they're worth. Then the dancers arrive to report they barely got away, and it's time for a final strut. Public Opinion brings a death sentence. Is there no appeal?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/klENeFNH3mYJNdfBnze1wwteBws.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1934-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What Price Jazz","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
