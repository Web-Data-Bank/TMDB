At the top of the film, we meet a variety of storytellers one on one. We don't know who's gay or straight or who's with whom. As their stories unfold and stereotypes fall by the wayside, love conquers all - and we find ourselves rooting for everyone. With remarkable honesty, good humor, great music and real heart, Inlaws &amp; Outlaws weaves together true stories of couples and singles, gay and straight, to embrace what we all have in common: we love.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/itLvfoFWXQA0mX185jaso8Wv07N.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inlaws & Outlaws","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2}
