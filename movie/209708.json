The films offered Crockwell a chance to experiment with various unorthodox animation techniques such as adding and removing non-drying paint on glass frame-by-frame, squeezing paint between two sheets of glass, and finger painting. The individual films created over a nine-year period were then stitched together for presentation, forming a nonsensical relationship that only highlights the abstract qualities of the images. â€”Kansas City Electronic Music and Arts Alliance","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/fC5o94PWfhFApZo11losMHedBhp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1946-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Glens Falls Sequence","video":false,"vote_average":5.944,"vote_count":18}
