Remembering the excitement of an artist or DJ \"in action\" is the key component for longevity because through our memory it is often how we measure an eventâ€™s effectiveness. In addition to simulating the artist and/or DJ, this DVD provides an array of features that will be discovered, explored and expanded upon.  All mix segments were filmed in Detroit, USA. A DJ setup and lighting were created to simulate the authentic look and stereo sound of a DJ in a club DJ booth. A black backdrop behind Jeff Mills was used so that the reprogramming of this footage in a live setting would not conflict with existing decor.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vYoFMH01rZLtPrVgtbIQr8fwFmq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":182,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Exhibitionist","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
