One day, he comes across a plucky, nine-year-old boy named Jeon Ingwon (played by Lee Inseong) who insists that he is Daegyu's son born out of wedlock. Daegyu tries every possible means to send the bold boy back to where he came from, including reporting him to the police, deserting him on the street and even pretending not to have known him, but to no avail. Ingwon makes an offer to Daegyu: he will leave him forever if they first travel across the country together. During the journey, Daegyu comes to learn Ingwon's secret and finds a reason not to continue their cross-land journey.","popularity":1.581,"poster_path":"/vL8dUkBqO26FZHy9tEDUPBcr3Bq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15792,"logo_path":null,"name":"Good Player","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2005-02-18","revenue":6562975,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cracked Eggs and Noodles","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":4}
