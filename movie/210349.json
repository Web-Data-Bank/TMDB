Nearing the twilight of a storied career, Sum must face a variety of challenging new obstacles, including the possible emigration of her family come 1997, the appearance of a promising young actress (Anita Yuen), the hiring of a Western-schooled stage director (David Wu), the surprising revelation of her daughter's sexuality, and finally the reappearance of a shocking secret from her past. Through it all, Sum must retain her professionalism and dignity, as the \"Hu-Du-Men\" between the stage and her life begins to blur. Emotional, intimate direction and Raymond To's intelligent, relevant screenplay make Hu-Du-Men worthwhile cinema, but it's Josephine Siao's brilliant, emotionally dynamic performance that sets this film above the rest.","popularity":0.776,"poster_path":"/h2U64sTNSWuMz8Ck2hBgfHF0HB9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":138661,"logo_path":null,"name":"Golden Harvest Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":78464,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ko Chi Sum Films Co.
