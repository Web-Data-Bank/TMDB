The album was recorded in a barn in rural Oregon. Pendarvia is heavily driven by the natural surroundings of the area, inter-cutting music with beautiful shots of the surrounding scenery. The film follows the abstractly linear narrative of the recording process, inter-cutting found moments of dialogue from the band, producer Tucker Martine, collaborators and friends. The film is a beautiful audio/visual collage that explores the trials and tribulations of the creative process.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2ZVV4iB7F56jGb31BvbxZTcRJoZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15813,"logo_path":"/dfPPIWH8syLWPv6zQi2NPPLAS7C.png","name":"Wieden+Kennedy Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pendarvia","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
