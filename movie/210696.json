The work revolves around four central characters: Othello, a Moorish general in the Venetian army; his new wife, Desdemona; his lieutenant, Cassio; and his trusted ensign, Iago. Because of its varied and current themes of racism, love, jealousy and betrayal, Othello is still often performed in professional and community theaters alike and has been the basis for numerous operatic, film and literary adaptations.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/yzyIHgOIE3E8b3tUtiXwNxV8cea.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":195,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Othello - Live at Shakespeare's Globe","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
