A co-worker brings her to a tarot-card reader, who introduces her to a club of women who meet occasionally to share an intoxicating brew, tease each other erotically with long-stemmed roses and honour the heathen god Pan. The occultist manages to corrupt the aunt and cousin, and lure the woman into full-fledged membership so she might participate in its climactic ritual.","popularity":0.7,"poster_path":"/kZq20LaX1WyVAuBem3zKhK9vh5j.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97422,"logo_path":null,"name":"Amalfi Films No. 4","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1966-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Red Roses of Passion","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":7}
