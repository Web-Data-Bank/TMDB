A sequence of overlapping interactions between a human and a dog often assumes a grotesque, comical form of intolerable compulsions. The short film raises a timid question about the complexity - or should we say imperfections - of human nature. Behaviors, gestures and habits of both the human and his dog show a far-reaching resemblance, while their mutual relationship is an unending cycle of everyday rituals. The character, entangled in the series of recurring events, unexpectedly discovers the terrifying animality of his own nature. This disturbing metamorphosis is interrupted by a sudden awakening. But was it merely a dream?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ritual","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
