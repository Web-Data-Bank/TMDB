A slice of life of a young, professional married couple with their darling baby turns a sharp, dark corner when the pair are arrested and charged with several counts of fraud. The reason: Terry and Samantha Succi aren't the man and woman that they purported to be... Terry and Samantha married under false pretenses, ignoring state law that discriminates against homosexual partners and prohibits them from receiving the same rights and benefits as their straight counterparts.","popularity":1.465,"poster_path":"/x9oa4QRrUwz3PRzYRf2qC8FXt20.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Affirmative Act","video":false,"vote_average":2.857,"vote_count":7}
