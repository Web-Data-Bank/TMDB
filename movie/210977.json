But his decision to accept a six-month research post in the Antarctic, making the first detailed study of a penguin colony, changes all that...  Living in Shackleton’s derelict hut, Forbush is alone at the frozen edge of the world, his only links to civilisation a two-way radio and letters to his elusive, would-be girlfriend, Tara, in London. Through an often ferocious winter in the company of the penguins, he grows increasingly attached to his hardy, endearing subjects – learning profound lessons in endurance and humility.","popularity":0.703,"poster_path":"/9lLGpolDp6NOB5BTSMm3HU0ZI0W.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":538,"logo_path":null,"name":"EMI Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1971-07-29","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mr. Forbush and the Penguins","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":5}
