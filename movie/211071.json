Writer and actress Raquel Villavicencio plays the ruthless head of the top-rated network, coming off as a Tagalog variation on Faye Dunaway's fabled character in Network. Her team has eschewed covering politics in favour of triedand- true tabloid fodder: demonic possession.","popularity":0.674,"poster_path":"/Aetp4GF3cnWVzf9IFJULrpf5E00.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23208,"logo_path":null,"name":"Solar Entertainment Corporation","origin_country":""},{"id":7008,"logo_path":null,"name":"Centerstage Productions","origin_country":"PH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2013-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What are you afraid of?","title":"Possession","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
