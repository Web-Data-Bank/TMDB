He goes to the edge of a cliff, where he meats an Asian spirit who gives him a heart shape that becomes a kite that hooks to him with a cane. This is followed by approximately ten minutes of kaleidoscopic images, including a man's hands, a dancing girl, and a cutout of Krishna. - IMDb","popularity":0.941,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1967-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No. 16: Oz: The Tin Woodman's Dream","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":10}
