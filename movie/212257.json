Yet when these brave African-American cavalrymen enter a scraggly frontier town, they must walk through it instead of ride. The town dishonors them but the soldiers' Native-American foes do not. Apache leader Victoria and other warriors give the horsemen a name of honor and strength: \"Buffalo Soldiers\".  The troopers' daring hunt for Victorio frames this stirring tribute to the former slaves and other African-Americans of the 9th and 10th U.S. Calvary Regiments. Danny Glover, Mykelti Williamson, Glynn Turman, Carl Lumbly and Michael Warren star in an adventure bringing to light that largely unknown story and the unique moral dilemma the men faced. Atten-hut! \"Buffalo Soldiers are riding\" through town.","popularity":1.404,"poster_path":"/80Vc40rPcUGDl5pBzFPGGxMAlka.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2231,"logo_path":"/zJBTkTxy0UiQETGRynEqxiFbmL8.png","name":"Trilogy Entertainment Group","origin_country":"US"},{"id":3559,"logo_path":null,"name":"Citadel Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":6189,"logo_path":null,"name":"Turner Pictures (I)","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":113519,"logo_path":"/wxcVGtJwKkElcCXP6A0opM82xu0.png","name":"Warner Home Video","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1997-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"From slaves to free men.
