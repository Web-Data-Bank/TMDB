Left with the care of her family home, she has trouble meeting the mortgage payments and her ex-boyfriend is the bank manager attempting to foreclose. When she takes in boarders to meet expenses, she unwittingly rents a room to an international criminal hiding out from a bounty hunter, John Flynn. When the bounty hunter shows up, the criminal takes a hike. Reluctantly admitting that he might need her help, Flynn agrees to make Sara a partner for half the bounty if they catch the missing man in time. What follows is a wild ride where Sara discovered that she is anything but boring and predictable.","popularity":1.176,"poster_path":"/rUbW0RnxI0rl6yXJwa1HcJSn52r.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":40731,"logo_path":null,"name":"Harlequin","origin_country":""},{"id":10864,"logo_path":"/uPoKSf3GtME7IZz4alnoWvc0nWx.png","name":"CTV","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":2514,"logo_path":"/zEyrFF8Nn325PXG0Q9j7my0JqIJ.png","name":"Alliance Films","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1995-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Awakening","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
