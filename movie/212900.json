For the first time in 25 years the procedure was again followed in California, USA. On April 21, 1992, just before 6 am, Robert Harris stepped into the bright green light. All witnesses had a valid reason to watch. For one is was a democratic duty, another wanted to see justice served, some wanted to help the condemned in the last moments of his life. They all looked at the same: a dying man. Yet each saw different things happen.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rv5VSpT686pm3zv59Kze9dB60oE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Procedure 769: The Witnesses to an Execution","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
