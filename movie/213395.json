Lawrence's simmering tale of sex, love, and family. In the years leading up to World War I, the problems faced by many families were uncannily similar to the issues that mankind would still be struggling with nearly a century later. Human relationships remain as fragile as ever, and the only constant in life seems to be a humbling sense of uncertainty. Sarah Lancashire stars in a drama detailing the anguish of first love, and the awkward confusion of first sex.","popularity":1.108,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":11842,"logo_path":"/eNw316EUzXBLVOzlZPVwOcPKoDw.png","name":"Company Pictures","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":8719,"logo_path":null,"name":"Isle of Man Film Commission","origin_country":""},{"id":2268,"logo_path":"/wgDks2qYgwN6u1OkW1bBre0rf4F.png","name":"Isle of Man Film","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2003-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":192,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An adaptation of the D.H.
