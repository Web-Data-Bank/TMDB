They are alternately looking for tenderness and pushing it away because they sense that it is a sign of vulnerability they can ill-afford. Kędzierzawska has the rare ability to take the world of children on its own terms. There is not a false note in this dazzlingly beautiful and emotionally involving story of three kids trying to find their path to a new life.  - Adelaide Film Festival","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dH8TkwBInITFicdlEZubwIOo4je.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107463,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kid Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2011-11-11","revenue":15031,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tomorrow Will Be Better","video":false,"vote_average":7.167,"vote_count":6}
