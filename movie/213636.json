To arrive there is your ultimate goal.  But do not hurry the voyage at all.  It is better to let it last for many years;  and to anchor at the island when you are old,  rich with all you have gained on the way,  not expecting that Ythaca will offer you riches.  Ythaca has given you the beautiful voyage.  Without her you would have never set out on the road.  She has nothing more to give you.  And if you find her poor, Ythaca has not deceived you.  Wise as you have become, with so much experience,  you must already have understood what Ythaca mean.”  Konstantínos Kaváfis","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8sgl6QCinZUF5WX28y8ne0td3M9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":41720,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alumbramento","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2010-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Road to Ythaca","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":9}
