A Long Island garage mechanic by day, the lanky-haired Speedo spends his free time at work, compulsively rebuilding his pieced-together wrecks before each competition: “It’s an addiction,” he says, “like nitro-methane through your veins.” But as a hobby turns into an obsession, Speedo’s marriage of twenty years begins to deteriorate like a junkyard Cadillac, which only fuels his raceway rages. Will a developing crush on a female track official finally bring peace to this hell on wheels? - Docurama Films","popularity":1.027,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":48874,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mile End Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Speedo","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
