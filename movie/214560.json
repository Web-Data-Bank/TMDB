The work uses only and exclusively found footage and material from the film, and implodes it to create a new audiovisual work, a new visual sound experience. The result is an experimental vision that pretends to expand the way we perceive films and tries to push our notion of audiovisual sensations.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"(Archive Works, AW#06)","title":"1812: War and Peace Studies","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
