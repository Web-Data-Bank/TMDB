While the Lebanese focus on surface level events that could rock the nation, few realize that below the ground we walk on, an actual shattering of the earth is mounting. Lebanon stands on several major fault lines, which are cracks in the earth's crust. The film investigates the geological situation in Lebanon, trying to look for the traces of the imminent disaster.","popularity":1.214,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"}],"release_date":"2013-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Disquiet","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
