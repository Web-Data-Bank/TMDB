He sets off to catch a live pygmy, with help from a tracking dog, but the dog isn't the world's most efficient, distracted first by some flowers, then when he actually encounters a pygmy, by the bone in his hair. Ultimately, he buries the pygmy; the Captain comes chasing along. With this crew, the pygmy's in no danger. Eventually, the pygmy swaps clothes with the Inspector; he runs off and grabs his whole tribe, and the safari crew takes off.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/653IYiTRekGICfCasz7TVlygsk8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1938-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Pygmy Hunt","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
