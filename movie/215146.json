He and Jacqueline smuggle diamonds and drugs, with the local police detective in on the take. Even though Paul is ex-CIA, he's not undercover, he just wants to win Jacqueline back. His CIA pals from black ops are on hand hoping to arrest Marko's boss. Detective Montrachet finds out Paul's past and sets up a double cross. Her aims are less clear: to get back with Paul, to stay with Marko, or to run her own scam and scamper away?","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/vszn0XOQCFzI9Drxfk3OjdTO7YB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2090,"logo_path":"/jYlUttNqcN5u1pzMQrh5AEhZ27t.png","name":"Motion Picture Corporation of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Glass Cage","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
