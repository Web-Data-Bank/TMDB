Genetic Engineering of plants has been shown through scientific study disruptive to  entire cellular mechanisms of plants, animals and humans, along with severe negative  impact on the environment.

To counter the lies, another award winning documentary hits back with the truth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seeds of Death: Unveiling the Lies of GMOs","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":3}
