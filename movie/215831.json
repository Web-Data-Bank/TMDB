Thursday, November 24, Thanksgiving Day. Alex, a local newspaper photographer, gets into a “green card marriage” with her good friend James, a Guam-born Filipino.  Miriam, a former member of the Philippine press and now an established Guam journalist, longs to repair a damaged relationship with her American husband.  Ella, a hotel housekeeper for almost 20 years, finds means of sending her 88-year old mother to the Philippines with the uncertainty of coming back.  As the island of Guam celebrates this classic American holiday when people count their blessings and give thanks, the lives of the three Filipina immigrants intersect and find themselves at a tug-o-war of sacrifice and significance where they must find their home or must they find it somewhere else.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8BL9It84rLmU65jIlqIBXaeeKlK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15808,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinemalaya Foundation","origin_country":"PH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2012-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Resident Aliens","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
