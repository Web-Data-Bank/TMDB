Razi recruited Sanfur when he was just 15, and developed a very close, almost fatherly relationship to him. Now 17, Sanfur tries to navigate between Razi’s demands and his loyalty to his brother, living a double life and lying to both men. Co-written by director Yuval Adler and Ali Waked—an Arab journalist who spent years in the West Bank—Bethlehem gives an unparalleled, moving and authentic portrait of the complex reality behind the news.","popularity":1.59,"poster_path":"/gVi8zai3sBrG66QUN33HlB1ONaR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24662,"logo_path":"/pME6OvhHDJPU96MthlqBolVoimO.png","name":"Pie Films","origin_country":"IL"},{"id":3984,"logo_path":"/pvOBu9K0zTRuwJW7WII34x17kdz.png","name":"Entre Chien et Loup","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":83017,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gringo Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2013-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When you are playing both sides, who do you trust?","title":"Bethlehem","video":false,"vote_average":6.096,"vote_count":26}
