Co-hosted by Chris Stein, from Blondie, and directed by filmmaker Amos Poe, the hour long show took television where it had never gone before: to the edge of civility and \"sub-realism\" as Glenn would put it. Walter Steding and his TV Party \"Orchestra\" provided a musical accompaniment to the madness at hand, and many artists and musicians, from The Clash, Nile Rodgers, Jean-Michel Basquiat, David Bryne and Arto Lindsey were regular guests. It was the cocktail party that could be a political party.  With 80 hours of disintegrating 3/4 inch videotape as a starting point, we tracked down the trend setting participants still living today and found out what they remember of the period and how the show influenced their lives. This, combined with clips from the orginal show, became the documentary \"TV Party.","popularity":1.132,"poster_path":"/iL1twbRsM7ouQP8MqVVHYxCvzBd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-08-03","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The TV show that's a party!","title":"TV Party","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
