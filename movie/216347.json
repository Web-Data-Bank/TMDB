As children play on bomb sites and in playgrounds, the elderly reminisce about their own childhoods. It’s a city still recovering from the Blitz over a decade before, not yet the home of football and music that it would become. Although much of the shooting took place in Liverpool, areas of Manchester, Salford and Stockport also make an appearance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8EHdPKAAlYKIt2WtGuCSCbpWdjp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1959-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Morning in the Streets","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
