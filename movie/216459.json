USA. Directed by Ken Jacobs. With technical assistance by Nisi Jacobs. Part two of four. “Joys…began on the corner of Broadway and Spring but it was the next night waiting on Bleecker that it was understood a movie of sorts was underway, depicting a general waiting for the bus rather than one specific evening. Since acquiring a small 3-D camera I dawdle everywhere but prolonged bus-waits allow for a continuity of images, thus a movie. Computer-editing with Nisi Jacobs allowed further investigation, this time into digital 3-D itself.” In 3-D. 40 min.\" – The Museum of Modern Art","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/o5nGaKLXQ3xYknMqUXfg9AIa3M1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Joys of Waiting for the Broadway Bus #2","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
