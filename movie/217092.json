After saving a crooked businessman in a warehouse, they are surprised by three pretty girls and a leather-jacketed boyfriend who are searching for a party. Evidently, they have unwittingly unleashed a kind of portal, endangering us all. Our heroes spend the night trying to survive, as one of the three women has been targeted as a \"breeder.\" She has apparently been chosen for being pretty tough - after all, she does the equivalent of shrugging her shoulders after witnessing her businessman father getting horribly decapitated just inches away.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u0U0MX5WlWR6C0FB5Qzf1inDK0w.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4702,"logo_path":null,"name":"Brimstone Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Vampirism... don't believe the hype!","title":"Vampires and Other Stereotypes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
