Her husband had a vasectomy years ago. And Ann hasn’t been with another man. Even more mysterious: as the baby grows inside her, Ann begins to change. She is beset by strange illnesses, pours tablespoons of salt on her food, turns the thermostat to 50 degrees, speed-reads academic tomes. But much bigger shocks are yet to come. Barbara Eden stars in this hypnotic, swiftly paced blend of horror and sci-fi from Richard Matheson, the popular and prolific writer who also penned the novel I AM LEGEND and several notable THE TWILIGHT ZONE scripts.","popularity":0.762,"poster_path":"/gipEL8rMlgdmJaKnlwii0uICrad.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":898,"logo_path":"/pBh5kde6mhGEMglYLwCdFnqK5zh.png","name":"Lorimar Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1974-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Her unborn baby orders her to ignore her doctor...Forces her to abandon her husband...And compels her to do what no woman has ever done before...Who Is This Child?","title":"The Stranger Within","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":6}
