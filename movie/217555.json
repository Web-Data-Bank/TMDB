If your bed could speak, what stories would it tell? We spend more than a third of our life in bed; it is the uttermost intimate space. In them lay our secrets; perhaps that is why we never think about them. They are a direct witness of who we are, or who we wish to be. Who would give their bed a voice? Surely nobody in his or her right mind. What secrets are held by motel beds, that of a teenager, a newly divorcée, that of your neighbors?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/39ZIQuk8K3ItoIpWXB5PpQb0TAr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A comedy between sheets","title":"The Bed","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":6}
