Durbin plays Penelope Craig, the starry-eyed daughter of wealthy Judson and Dorothy Craig (Charles Winninger, Nella Walker). Developing a crush on much-older playboy Bill Morley (Joseph Cotton), Penelope stops at nothing to land the elusive Morley as her husband. Highlights include Durbin's renditions of \"Begin the Beguine\" and the \"Seguidilla\" from Carmen, and a captivating sequence that includes highlights from Durbin's earlier films, presented as home movies!","popularity":0.654,"poster_path":"/4HxGeSnccLbhxcUIsIeylp4Guxb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33,"logo_path":"/8lvHyhjr8oUKOOy2dKXoALWKdp0.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1943-07-16","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hers to Hold","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":6}
