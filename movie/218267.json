Young Max has low expectations for his first Christmas after his parents’ divorce, when suddenly a large moose crashes through the roof of his garage. And if that isn’t strange enough, the moose claims to have fallen from Santa’s sleigh! But being friends with a moose isn’t all that simple. Especially since Max’s grumpy neighbor has no interest in hanging stockings for Christmas but would love to hang up a pair of moose antlers, and Santa is out there somewhere looking to get his sleigh back!","popularity":2.29,"poster_path":"/j3QLSpRassdBmdahXSKC0I9GeXj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2345,"logo_path":"/nozBgqHmM9A22IHkghTnLiUrM7Q.png","name":"Lemming Film","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":16586,"logo_path":"/as4K4ruByzOeiC1O8d9ou6T1X5F.png","name":"Anchorage Entertainment","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2013-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Christmoose Story","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":15}
