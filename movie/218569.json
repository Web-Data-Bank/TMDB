When Richard Chapman enters her life, a romance develops and McKay begins to let the outside world in to her private world.  The prospect of an operation arises that will restore McKay's eyesight, but the fear of what it will do to her relationship with Chapman and the concern over the fate of her guide dog weigh heavily upon her decision to do the procedure.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/ArnmGEoTVXU3xGIYZdzeYVHtO6c.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111706,"logo_path":null,"name":"TTC Enterprises","origin_country":""},{"id":111707,"logo_path":null,"name":"Entheos Unlimited Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1984-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Second Sight: A Love Story","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
