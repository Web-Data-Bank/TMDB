While time moves on, and the years pass by, we allow ourselves to become more subjected to psychological and developmental damage brought on by a system of control, rules, response-abilities and consequences. How long has this damage been happening, and how has it effected the natural course of human evolution and progress as a species? Is there truly a master plan in effect to restrict our potential and keep us from evolving into what we are truly meant to be as a people? It is important that the world is connected in oneness, but is this simply an idea or part of the plan to bring in a one world government system?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gRWLKqdFcdfYvkaPbhVMZEtFDGU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eye of the Illuminati","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
