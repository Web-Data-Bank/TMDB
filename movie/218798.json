Bernstein was an integral part of the legendary Seattle rock scene of the late 80's and early 90s, and in 1991 was dubbed the 'Godfather of Grunge.'","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/aSO3uoBtaqqDAv549cjKivnVFsZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Am Secretly An Important Man","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
