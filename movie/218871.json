Well, Erik Clausen turns nostalgia into a vivid tribute to the moods and manners of the 1950s Danish Rock'n Roll by picking up a group of dispersed fellow bandsmen from wherever life and fate have left them stranded to have them revive their group and relive the good old days. A spirit of social solidarity permeates throughout.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/j4GqlnTAHys79ZlGcO3HMtBCNQJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":99305,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film-Cooperativet Danmark","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"1983-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rocking Silver","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":4}
