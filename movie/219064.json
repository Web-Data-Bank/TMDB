It’s a story about a boy facing the surreal, degenerated society of his native village full of hate and sadistic anger while searching for his mother. It’s a story about a pregnant girl who wants to give birth to her child whose childhood will probably be even worse than hers. But her own sisters are forcing her to have an abortion.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lMo5mepsO8gQxnjV9W5tYGXWz5L.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2707,"logo_path":null,"name":"Novotny \u0026 Novotny Filmproduktion","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2013-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sickfuckpeople","video":false,"vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":7}
