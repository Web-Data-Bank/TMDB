Overnight, the small farming community became the two companiesâ€™ official Junction City, and no traveling passenger would cross the country by rail without stopping in Ogden.  Produced by documentary filmmaker Issac Goeckeritz and narrated by Phil Riesen, Ogden: Junction City of the West tells the story of the remarkable influence the railroad and its millions of traveling passengers would have on the culture and commerce of the American West.  Ogden: Junction City of the West aired on PBS Station KUED7 from 2007-2010. The film was produced in cooperation with the Union Station Foundation and is currently shown at the Union Station Museum and sold to support the ongoing operations of the museum.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ziXdbrC2wIppzYx1CUsnBYep66J.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Ogden Junction City of the West Documentary","title":"Ogden: Junction City of the West","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
