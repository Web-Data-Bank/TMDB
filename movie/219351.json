In Argentina and Chile, his commitment against military regimes is still remembered. Joaquín Sabina arrived later. His poetry bewitched the audience. In Argentina, he is a tango singer as much as a rocker; in Mexico, the mariachis sing their songs. The former is a symbol, a venerated figure; the latter is a “cuate,” as they say in Mexico, a buddy with whom you can always count.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/diiLpfKbXHKYi3YFkl4kbYKeUgE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118995,"logo_path":null,"name":"What's Up Doc","origin_country":""},{"id":52867,"logo_path":"/sihvTcE5dwZ4xl90uVcUHcet8Fc.png","name":"Lastor Media","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":118996,"logo_path":null,"name":"Taller de Ultramarinos (UTE)","origin_country":""},{"id":118997,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sony Music Spain","origin_country":""},{"id":9335,"logo_path":null,"name":"Canal+ España","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":981,"logo_path":"/pkrdO9ykplO4Zc8edikoSX5APUN.png","name":"TVE","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2013-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Serrat & Sabina: Two for the Road","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
