In less than five minutes, the project was constructed: Manoël was writing a poem that we will film with our friends Bernard, Jérôme, and François. And our dreams of childhood were made in less than a week by going back and forth to the banks of Douro, on foot, then by car, then in a helicopter, back to where we were following these marvelous clouds, with Manoël and me screaming stanzas of a poem inspired by the wind, the water, and friendship.\" -  Jean Rouch","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/5MfwaUsOXn1oSyCpe2tqPKHZVFx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"En une poignée de mains amies","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
