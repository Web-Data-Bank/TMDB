(N.B. proper prints and a negative do exist, just not in Lampert's possession!) With dubious methods used to achieve authenticity, El Adios Largos is at once an uncanny aesthetic experience and a playful exploration of the philosophical conundrums involved for those working to preserve film history for generations to come.","popularity":1.344,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El Adios Largos","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
