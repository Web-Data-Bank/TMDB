None of the song performances would make it onto albums showcasing this iteration of Zappa's band, his last touring rock group.  The broadcast itself would not be used by Zappa either, as the television station presented him with a faulty VHS instead of the master tape.  This concert video lives on only as a bootleg.","popularity":0.672,"poster_path":"/29b0PfeRLggt2jwFKu4kEe8d36g.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":134,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frank Zappa: Live in Barcelona","video":true,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
