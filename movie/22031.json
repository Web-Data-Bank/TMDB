With roots in a tribal past, this movement attempts to format the future of a truly global community by combining elements of electronic/percussive music, the psychedelic imagination, and mass dancing. From warehouses to mountain retreats to the deserts of the Mojave, an unseen world comes into clear focus; with kinetic camera work and candid interviews, this slice of visual anthropology probes the underbelly of a worldwide subculture with the help of some of electronic music's most acclaimed DJs, a technomusicologist, and a county sheriff. Open your mind to this moving entertainment experience and intimate portrait of a modern counter-culture that follows its own electronically induced beat.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":49150,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wondrous Monster Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":49151,"logo_path":null,"name":"Liturgy Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Synergy: Visions of Vibe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
