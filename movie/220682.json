But his happiness is short-lived. Marina only wants Gideon to pretend to be her boyfriend so she can investigate a séance as an undercover reporter. It turns out that Gideon and Marina aren’t the only ones with something to hide. Ramona, the not-so-typical medium, suspects there are hidden cameras and her creepy sidekick Errol keeps disappearing when the lights go out. Something’s unsettling about Marina’s editor, Trevor, and his timid wife, Helen. A dead woman’s daughter, Lily, is an unbalanced mess, and her boyfriend, David, is less of a rock and more of a stoner. When the séance turns south, a mournful spirit will ensure all of their buried secrets are brought to light.","popularity":0.656,"poster_path":"/9QWwoeqjR5k4F03XlkkOxcByevs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spirit Cabinet","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
