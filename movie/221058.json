Songs like \"Fly Like An Eagle\", \"Rockin' Me\" and \"Take The Money And Run\" still sound fresh today and continue to turn young fans on to the magic of the band's sound. One look at the audience that attended the band's two sold-out nights at Chicago's famed Ravinia, and it becomes clear that this is a group that continues to develop an ardent fan base while drawing long-time fans eager to hear their favorites time and time again. Steve Miller Band is as vital today as ever. This three disc set (2 DVD/1 CD) is the ultimate addition to any Steve Miller Band fan's - or fan of great music in general's - DVD collection.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/tJxlDNkVYd0won8aUxMC9e9AHoN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3888,"logo_path":null,"name":"Coming Home Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Steve Miller Band - Live from Chicago","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
