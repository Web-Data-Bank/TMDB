In Saga Two, the Royal Hong Kong Police put into operation a new plan to counteract the problem of increasing violent crimes committed by new arrivals from across the border in China. In agreement with Chinese authorities, three Hong Kong detectives go undercover as illegal immigrants in order to infiltrate the powerful gang that is organizing the crime wave. The action is tough and graphic, reminiscent of The French Connection, Hong Kong style.","popularity":3.233,"poster_path":"/subtaCMbqJHXHiUm0BG1XrOeteX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22067,"logo_path":null,"name":"Johnny Mak Production Co.
