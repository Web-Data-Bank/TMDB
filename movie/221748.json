Filmmaker Myriam Fougère takes us on a journey to meet the lesbian writers, philosophers and activists who were key players in creating a revolutionary sisterhood. From Montréal to Texas, by way of New York, Myriam encounters lesbians who chose to live only among women. This marginal yet international movement is brought to life through archival footage and photographs, and evocative interviews with these courageous women, many of whom are now in their seventies and eighties.","popularity":3.194,"poster_path":"/q1SE4k4jXy2tTRQwSQaFTZUxdX8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lesbiana: A Parallel Revolution","video":false,"vote_average":2.9,"vote_count":4}
