Whether it's a new antique to sell at her consignment shop, an Atari game for her son or a piece of furniture for her handy husband Jason to refurbish, she has made a career out of her treasure hunting prowess. When a string of burglaries hits her town, Jennifer's keen eye for detail and her natural problem solving instincts even help her see the connection between these burglaries and local garage sales! Jennifer works with Detective Adam Iverson to investigate her theory that the perpetrators of the burglaries are fellow garage sale regulars. The case escalates to dangerous levels when Jennifer discovers the dead body of her friend. Even though the deceased's husband, Ben Douglas, finds nothing missing in their house, and the police label the death as accidental, Jennifer suspects that the death may be related to the burglaries.","popularity":6.067,"poster_path":"/cNdqjhEhaubx3zK9bdXX4z9hWRi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3958,"logo_path":"/xkdYNmOW6e4gjgp4NSLRt0W5UIj.png","name":"Front Street Pictures","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":92735,"logo_path":null,"name":"Axelrod-Ett Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":199044,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bargain Street Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Garage Sale Mystery","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":52}
