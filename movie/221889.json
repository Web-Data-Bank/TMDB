It is about the making of BADLANDS, DAYS OF HEAVEN, THE THIN RED LINE and the personal involvement of some of the most representative figures of the American culture itself. This medley of voices has given origin to a journey throughout the whole United States, from California to Colorado, from Virginia to Minnesota, passing by New York and Los Angeles. Every stop represents an ideal set in which all the characters of the films come to life once again giving place to a growing flow of memories. The narrative dimension of Malick's cinema resounds and opens a new horizon on the visible contradictions of the American culture; no easy judgement but a critical consciousness is what emerges from this coral speech, together with a definite need: the necessity of art. A need that Terrence Malick was able to satisfy.","popularity":0.697,"poster_path":"/kSnVkRUEmxpILRpLtWYf3pP6GlM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16824,"logo_path":null,"name":"Campinella Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":16826,"logo_path":null,"name":"Citrullo International","origin_country":""},{"id":2709,"logo_path":null,"name":"Misami Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2002-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rosy-Fingered Dawn: A Film on Terrence Malick","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1}
