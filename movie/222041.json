Indy runs away into the Russian countryside and wakes in the morning on a haystack. He encounters colorful Gypsies, fierce Imperial Cossack troops, and an odd, cantankerous old man named Leo Tolstoy, who is in full agreement that \"hell\" is other people. Later, in Greece, Indy meets Nikos Kazantzakis, the writer who would some day write Zorba the Greek.","popularity":1.717,"poster_path":"/vOSolQi2mDdTnfbo3C9iEmrFQhe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7671,"logo_path":"/r7KeUsNVv0iggZRh6XmNNq2OEw1.png","name":"Amblin Television","origin_country":"US"},{"id":1,"logo_path":"/o86DbpburjxrqAzEDhXZcyE8pDb.png","name":"Lucasfilm Ltd.","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Adventures of Young Indiana Jones: Travels with Father","video":false,"vote_average":6.214,"vote_count":14}
