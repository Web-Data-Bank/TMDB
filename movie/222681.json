Cohen uses several types of film image to add texture to the layered composition. Beautiful shades of grey, silver, black and blue echo the water, reminiscent of early photography and silverprints. Cohen says, \"The piece was constructed primarily from footage I’d shot of skinnydippers at swimming holes in Georgia and rural Pennsylvania. It’s about water and memory and stories just submerged. It is also, in part, a response to thinking about censorship. I would say that Drink Deep is both unabashedly and deceptively romantic. Surface, flow, and undertow. What looks like paradise is always paradise lost.\"","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/lk7HSfBVTSaEIPji08fEycB0VgE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Drink Deep","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3}
