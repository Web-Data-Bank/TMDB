In order to prove to her dad that she can handle the job, she disguises herself as an ordinary \"working girl\" and gets a job in her dad's plant. There she meets and falls in love with a clerk. She brings the young man home to meet her folks, but during the evening the family safe is robbed, and all signs point to her new boyfriend.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lvoYbOSy4yHy9VgRzyRdpra3ima.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":59482,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chesterfield Motion Pictures Corporation (I)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1928-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Adorable Cheat","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
