She gets hold of a Chinese herbal pillow that eventually helps her fall asleep again but it also draws her near something unexpected. \"Hide And Seek\" casts a group of young newcomers into an abandoned school campus where they meet longtime janitor Mr. Chan who takes shelter at the school. Playing hide-and-seek after midnight, the teenagers go missing, one after another. In his self-directed piece \"Black Umbrella,\" Teddy Robin makes solving conflicts on the street at night his mission and marks each closed case with his signature black umbrella. Before he calls it a day, he meets a prostitute who forcefully pulls him upstairs for business and unfortunately things spiral out of control.","popularity":2.889,"poster_path":"/ho41qnfgmY8nkOylJlR323wnJ4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12205,"logo_path":null,"name":"EDKO Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2013-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tales From The Dark 2","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":10}
