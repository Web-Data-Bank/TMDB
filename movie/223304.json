At the instigation of these more moderate groups, the only rich boy in the group is arrested, and he becomes subject to a smear campaign which has him bedding all the women in the group - a particularly damaging libel, because one of the girls is underage. This is the first film to be directed by Thomas Robsahm, the Norwegian son of the great Italian actor, Ugo Tognazzi (now deceased)","popularity":0.62,"poster_path":"/1IQczXKoohtsjmqy8iDnliAtWta.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8703,"logo_path":"/mMZ6GWxVO1Z9hpJXTx9v9SiY0ZX.png","name":"Speranza Film","origin_country":"NO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"1992-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Svarte pantere","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
