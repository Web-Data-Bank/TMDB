They played Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers investigating the murder of a miner. The story, of course, was less important than speed and action, which directors Ray Taylor and Lewis D. Collins delivered in typical slap-dash Universal style. Starlet Daun Kennedy did not make much of an impression as the imperiled leading lady, and former star Robert Armstrong (of King Kong fame) was wasted in a subordinate role. Rondo Hatton, a non-actor whose grotesque appearance (caused by acromegaly, the so-called \"Elephant Man\" disease) was tastelessly exploited by Universal in the '40s, appeared as one of the outlaws.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uHfwBrR9yv80rqmlz13lEqdFQDa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33,"logo_path":"/8lvHyhjr8oUKOOy2dKXoALWKdp0.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1945-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":221,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"THE MOUNTIES GET THEIR MAN...blasting the outlaws out of the Northwest!","title":"The Royal Mounted Rides Again","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":1}
