Jerry pulls up a box of popcorn and watches, too. Tom notices Jerry and chases him into his hole. Tom designs a better mousetrap, but Jerry alters the plans, so it doesn't work any better than it did the first time the footage was used, in Designs on Jerry (1955).","popularity":1.721,"poster_path":"/5jNwbsZ6Z3VK8SYwQadTKipErGm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1967-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shutter Bugged Cat","video":false,"vote_average":5.824,"vote_count":17}
