As he struggles out of his slimy prison he comes face to face with his opponent - a grotesque, powerful and very angry bug. All 3 ft of it. And so begins a hideous, nail-biting, comedic, all-action adventure to find a safe haven while constantly outwitting an infestation of monstrous proportions. As Cooper embarks on his journey, he befriends a ragtag group of survivors including the feisty, determined Sara. Will they make it to safety before they are picked off one by one? And what other surprises are in store for our group of unlikely heroes?","popularity":5.503,"poster_path":"/2wIdvayu0U3svIwgVkN0UW6jaKy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152,"logo_path":"/ttbRwgVW7EoVOS4Af7MnyxFM0FM.png","name":"Icon Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":4097,"logo_path":null,"name":"Heavy Duty Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Prepare for global swarming!","title":"Infestation","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":174}
