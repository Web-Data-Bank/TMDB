She rents an apartment to work undisturbed on her new book, but by some acoustic anomaly she can hear all that is said in the next apartment in which a psychiatrist holds his office. When she hears a young woman tell that she finds it harder and harder to bear her life, Marion starts to reflect on her own life. After a series of events she comes to understand how her unemotional attitude towards the people around her affected them and herself.","popularity":5.222,"poster_path":"/a3gcc9JqrRqWRudAWBy5P3oLWMl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13309,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jack Rollins \u0026 Charles H.
