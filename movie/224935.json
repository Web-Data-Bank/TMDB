It ended up a document for the preservation of a fishing culture amid the ecosystem that created it.     The Bonefish Culture of Andros Island, Bahamas – the island that holds the unofficial world record for a bonefish caught on a fly – had not been truly experienced from a native Bahamian’s point of view, until now. Filmmaker Jamie Howard does this by hitching a ride on a boat bow, setting up impromptu interviews on lobster crates, and driving the roads of the Bahamas’ least explored island. The driving force of the story is the fishing reunion of two of the best guides in the world, Andy Smith and Charlie Neymour. It is a fishing trip that for them had not occurred since childhood.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bySxQgHHyAUdpE4IgeTeWPo7sag.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A JOURNEY WITH THE FOUNDING FATHERS OF SALTWATER FLY FISHING AND THEIR SONS","title":"In Search of a Rising Tide","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
