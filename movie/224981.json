And the power of governments behind the events has been replaced by the power of holding companies. Nowadays you don't conquer a country. You buy it. \"Short story of long betrayals\" is again set in the Republic of Queimada, where in the \"Salar de Queimada\" (a salt lake) lies 50% of lithium in the whole world. Not surprisingly, there is an international interest in its fate and a breathless fight to seize it.","popularity":0.951,"poster_path":"/AbkaUPL45vHwdSQ8LaK8E7XgVFG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lithium Conspiracy","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":3}
