Prophetic and surprisingly humorous, the narrative is driven by a tenacious single mother of seven, who risks bankruptcy and homelessness to fulfill a dream. Shot over five years and set in the oldest house in England. This film is an intimate portrayal of a large bohemian family with all the ups and downs of daily life, an intriguing insight into England's history, and future. This is a nail-biting journey through the economic crash and life's biggest gamble. This is not a story of the conspicuous consumerism of billionaires; rather this is the human cost of the banking crisis.","popularity":0.882,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Folie à Deux - Madness Made of Two","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
