But Rocco, Orsola's brother, dreading a family scandal, constrains Orsola to silence.

Later, yielding to the pleas of Orsola, Rocco and Rocco's son, Salvatore, the girl stays on in the house, and Salvatore falls in love with the beautiful stranger, who is careful to keep the family members from learning she is Rosaria, the grown up sister of Pietro seeking revenge for the deaths of her brother and mother.","popularity":2.143,"poster_path":"/dLIs50v0RnEyJFDaquqr6TbnXZF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1679,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lux Film","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1949-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lure of the Sila","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":4}
