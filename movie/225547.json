He lives with his uncle Abrakadabra Appa Rao (Krishna Bhagawan), who is a magician. Buchi Raju happens to come across Maha Lakshmi (Sharmila Mandre) one fine day and falls in love with her. Maha Lakshmi also responds to Buchi Babu and they fall in love.  Maha Lakshmi’s father Subba Rao (M.S.Narayana) does not approve of this alliance as Buchi Raju is not a rich guy.
