In the context of this film, \"Allegro non Troppo\" means Not So Fast!, an interjection meaning \"slow down\" or \"think before you act\" and refers to the film's pessimistic view of Western progress (as opposed to the optimism of Disney's original).","popularity":4.924,"poster_path":"/6yvBAAgDVDwfcY3dXT69HlxT7yk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13561,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ministero del Turismo e dello Spettacolo","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":17797,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bruno Bozzetto Film","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1976-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Allegro Non Troppo","video":false,"vote_average":7.074,"vote_count":81}
