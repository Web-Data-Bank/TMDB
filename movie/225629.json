Desperate to be someone\r in life—and to pay off his debts—he embarks on a journey into the\r increasingly magnetic world of big-box Christianity. Religion seems\r to offer a quick path to becoming rich and soon González is willing\r to do anything in his power in order to make it happen. A thriller that\r evokes the gritty style of Martin Scorsese’s Taxi Driver, Gonzalez:\r The False Prophet is a suspenseful ride through the darker side of\r charismatic preachers and upstart religions that flourish on the hardearned\r money of desperate people in need of hope.","popularity":0.911,"poster_path":"/pV2uoaYJgYUok9ZmE1VlDpD2orU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17117,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chacal Filmes","origin_country":"MX"},{"id":17118,"logo_path":null,"name":"Echasa","origin_country":""},{"id":9980,"logo_path":"/9pLJAcyas8aUyVq0mwbv2EMQmgW.png","name":"Fondo para la Producción Cinematográfica de Calidad","origin_country":"MX"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2014-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"González: The False Prophet","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":7}
