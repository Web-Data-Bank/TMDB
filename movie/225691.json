Silvia is pregnant, and her lover (her boss) won't leave his wife. Maite, newly a widow, discovers she's penniless but wants to maintain appearances and give her daughter a fancy wedding, and Pecholata, a punk kid living in a youth center, will soon be turned out on the streets. Lola, who cleans a bank every morning, decides to rob it, convincing the others to join her: they'll use replica guns, dress as men, take Silvia hostage, and all will be smooth. But things go awry, including the fact that Lola's ex, Gustavo, is a cop. Desperation may be the mother of invention - and a corrupt bank manager its father.","popularity":2.016,"poster_path":"/4n4TFjmI9kawpTimlxPtwETFlvS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":50947,"logo_path":null,"name":"Grupo Boca","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2001-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hold-Up","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":16}
