Foghorn tries to dump a load of concrete on top of the dog, but the chute for dropping the concrete suddenly extends itself to a position directly above Foghorn, who is covered over by the concrete and frozen in a \"Thinker\" pose. Little Henery attaches a rope to the cement-laden Foghorn and drags him home for a tough-to-chew chicken dinner.","popularity":1.254,"poster_path":"/fjNSUUc658ePi9TNc8X05lAmS76.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":174,"logo_path":"/IuAlhI9eVC9Z8UQWOIDdWRKSEJ.png","name":"Warner Bros.
