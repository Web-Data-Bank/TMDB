He falls in love with a waitress and the two have a child. Though considered by some to be a proto-feminist yarn, the film dwells on the consequences that equal rights for women may generate rather than openly champion suffrage. Similar in to Ibsen's The Doll House in many ways, the film provides mannered, solemn melodrama, ably acted by Mosjoukine and Yureneva.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ccv4QJz9a6UxJASSX6RkfSQNRNm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24060,"logo_path":null,"name":"Khanzhonkov","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"1914-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Woman of Tomorrow","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":4}
