This female grim reaper, considered a saint by followers but Satanic by the Catholic Church, is worshiped by people whose lives are filled with danger and/or violence- criminals, gang members, transvestites, sick people, drug addicts, and families living in rough neighborhoods. \"La Santa Muerte\" examines the origins of the cult and takes us on a tour of the altars, jails, and neighborhoods in Mexico where the saint's most devoted followers can be found.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yiKW8fhfnIcThEyMjjMRNuXpWwU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27329,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dark Night Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2007-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Saint Death","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":4}
