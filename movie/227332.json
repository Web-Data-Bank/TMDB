We wrap things up with WrestleMania XV's Shane McMahon vs. X-Pac, as well as the greatest Ladder Match in WWE history from Terri Invitational Tournamnet at 1999's No Mercy.  What sets this DVD apart though, are the in-depth Superstar commentaries as you watch the action. It's all here with an exclusive backstage perspective from the ones who lived it and watched it all unfold before their eyes.  So what are you gonna do tonight? The answer, my friend, is right here in your sweaty little hands.","popularity":0.665,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1998-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Attitude Collection","title":"WWF: Eve of Destruction","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
