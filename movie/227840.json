With his disconcerting stories and his ease in talking about disturbing subjects, this young man bewitches, surprises and disconcerts! His universe is nourished by cultural references and a good dose of derision! His favorite subjects are taboos.  Its mission leaves no doubt: to proclaim loud and clear what people think softly. Incisive, with punch, punch and more punch, Eddy King has adopted a winning formula: simple and authentic.  Show recorded on July 20, 2012 at the 5th auditorium of Place des Arts, Montreal.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kXX3fPPjhOe4aSWkKn6V3FTNr1g.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eddy King, Premier One-Man Show!","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
