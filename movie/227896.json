Fourvieres hill was ablaze for ninety minutes, fired on by cannons of light, fireworks and images synchronised to music being performed live on the central stage by Jean-Michel Jarre, 60 musicians and 120 choristers. A baroque feast, blending classical and avant-garde, workmanship and high-tech, past and future, Rendez-Vous Lyon will long be remembered as an exceptional event.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/x4S745Tce57ZedCNjCHcpVFudaH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15241,"logo_path":null,"name":"Francis Dreyfus Musique","origin_country":""},{"id":96400,"logo_path":"/lTzSvArTDdffkHuXLEfy9IX1PLE.png","name":"Polygram Music Video","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1986-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"},{"english_name":"Latin","iso_639_1":"la","name":"Latin"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Concert for the Pope","title":"Jean-Michel Jarre - Rendez-Vous Lyon","video":true,"vote_average":8.7,"vote_count":3}
