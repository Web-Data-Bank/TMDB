Joe never knew his father, and his mother, Rebecca, is keeping her lips sealed no matter how much he protests.

Indeed, he often assails the local reverend with thorny theological questions and joins Joe on his quest to find his biological father.","popularity":9.598,"poster_path":"/vRJcV9l3tLFoUWZel9RikS3nfJ6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":915,"logo_path":"/4neXXpjSJDZPBGBnfWtqysB5htV.png","name":"Hollywood Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":175,"logo_path":"/trtXLj3zv8T9ke1Vhw4SCkkM4JJ.png","name":"Caravan Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1998-09-11","revenue":18253415,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Destiny has big plans for little Simon Birch.","title":"Simon Birch","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":205}
