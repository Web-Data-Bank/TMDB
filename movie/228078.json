It tells the story of Shiva, who is very good at studies, but is forced to work after his dad expires. He starts working at a Shopping Mall along with his village friend Buchi Babu, and he soon realizes that far from the way it looks from outside, the Shopping Mall is a jail in itself. They have to work for almost 16 hours a day, eat in hellhole conditions, and live like dogs. Inspite of all these, everyone seems to be working because of their own reasons.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/paLvMyQRQiECxnxBVAloUZPK6ZW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Telugu","iso_639_1":"te","name":"తెలుగు"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shopping Mall","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
