As if she hadn't got enough trouble already with her daughter Rosa Maria, who has left her husband now Costantino, her son, has disrobed. Afraid to be the talk of the village, relegates him to a distant lighthouse belonging to the family. But Costantino does not remain far from the madding crowd for long. It does not take long indeed before all the local (or even distant) outcasts flock together there: Magnolia, a retired escort girl; Arturo, Rosa Maria's estranged husband; Valbona, a lesbian; Rosa Maria herself; and, to crown it all, two eccentric workers accompanied by a little girl... After a period of chaos, this small world gradually discovers that unity makes strength.","popularity":4.33,"poster_path":"/2kMgLAQMpi3YRmP9KQ2JViV8yTk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3110,"logo_path":null,"name":"PACO Cinematografica","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":20416,"logo_path":"/jTXzZRiKZt7L4YvVW4DGvqU51RU.png","name":"Regione Lazio","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":89156,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sardinian Film Commission","origin_country":""},{"id":174,"logo_path":"/IuAlhI9eVC9Z8UQWOIDdWRKSEJ.png","name":"Warner Bros.
