As the co-founder, songwriter, producer and guitarist of Chic he helped define the sound of the '70s, as disco took the world by storm. Nile and musical partner Bernard Edwards captured the essence of New York's iconic Studio 54 creating hit after hit for bands like Chic &amp; Sister Sledge. But the music that had made Chic would also break them, thanks to the 'Disco Sucks' backlash. What could have been the end for Nile Rodgers would actually be a new beginning as a producer of some of the biggest hits of the 80s for the likes of Diana Ross, David Bowie, Madonna and Duran Duran.  In this profile documentary, the ever-charismatic Rodgers contributes an engaging and often frank interview to tell the tale of how, born to Beatnik, heroin-addict parents in New York, he picked up a guitar as a teenager and embarked on a journey to learn his craft as a musician, before becoming one of disco's most successful artists.","popularity":0.624,"poster_path":"/c84VCFWKFQG7Fxsde6DjbLP4OSR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nile Rodgers: The Hitmaker","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
