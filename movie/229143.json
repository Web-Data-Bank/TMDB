It is a short film based on Beauty and an Airplane, a short story by Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Ratanaruang's film tells the story of a man (Ananda Everingham) who falls in love with a woman (Khemapsom Sirisukha) he sees at the check-in counter of an airport. Most of the film takes place in the sleek blackened interior of the plane's cabin -- the camera panning between the two seats, lighting now one, now the other of the occupants. The two passengers never exchange a word, title cards occasionally allowing us to know what the man is thinking. Those familiar only with his work on Dumplings or Wong Kar-wai's films might be surprised at cinematographer Christopher Doyle's uncustomary restraint. Christopher Doyle doubles as both taxi driver and captain in the film.","popularity":0.91,"poster_path":"/t2dUUtSkx2VXm6nmSWQC7Gsapdo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34217,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jeonju International Film Festival","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Twelve Twenty","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
