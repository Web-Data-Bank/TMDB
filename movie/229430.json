Lucky is a US-based software professional, and is a teetotaler, always abiding by the pressure and demands of his parents, so much to the fact that he does not have the courage to speak out that he already has a girlfriend. Bharath Kumar, the youngest son, the character played by Diganth, is a carefree individual with weird ideas on life. Bharath meets a tomboyish girl, Ambika, who is the house-owner's niece, and they begin to mingle well due to the nature of their personalities.  However, following a few unusual twists and turns, the alliance is called off and the groom's family members walk out due to embarrassment. Ambika, who has now developed a strong feeling of love towards Bharath, goes ahead and confronts him. And finally, Bharath too says yes.","popularity":1.96,"poster_path":"/nTNvKatbiE2auu81dFwJPDRB7Wu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17585,"logo_path":null,"name":"Yograj Movies","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2010-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":123,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kannada","iso_639_1":"kn","name":"?????"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pancharangi","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":6}
