The concept of Uncensored was that each match on the card was ostensibly unsanctioned, meaning they were not subject to the normal rules of WCW-sanctioned wrestling matches. The main event was Team nWo (Kevin Nash, Scott Hall, Hollywood Hogan & Randy Savage) versus Team Piper (Roddy Piper, Chris Benoit, Steve McMichael & Jeff Jarrett) versus Team WCW (Lec Luger, The Giant & Scott Steiner) in a Triangle Elimination Match. Also at the event, Prince Iaukea defended the WCW World Televsion Championship against Rey Mysterio, Jr. (again), Public Enemy wrestled Harlem Heat in a Texas Tornado match, Buff Bagwell faced Scotty Rigs in a Strap match, Glacier fought Mortis, Psychosis was matched against Ultimo Dragon, and Eddie Gurrero defended the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship against Dean Malenko.","popularity":0.927,"poster_path":"/442ooBUWm3bjrZAUkputpzVLRfA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13510,"logo_path":null,"name":"World Championship Wrestling (WCW)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1997-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":164,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"you'll never see it coming!","title":"WCW Uncensored 1997","video":true,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
