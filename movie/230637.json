The words of her teacher are a gentle invitation to express herself. But Vashti can’t draw - she’s no artist. To prove her point, Vashti jabs at a blank sheet of paper to make an unremarkable and angry mark. \"There!\" she says.  That one little dot marks the beginning of Vashti’s journey of surprise and self-discovery. That special moment is the core of Peter H. Reynolds’s delicate fable about the creative spirit in all of us.","popularity":0.849,"poster_path":"/dsZu5Nesj4jhrM0hNepfPKcqwiv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13636,"logo_path":null,"name":"Weston Woods Studios","origin_country":"US"},{"id":1938,"logo_path":"/Tmc9JLmLPTSQUgsMP4BjCN8Off.png","name":"Scholastic Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Her teacher smiled.","title":"The Dot","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
