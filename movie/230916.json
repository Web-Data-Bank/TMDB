Perhaps he won't even be returning to Madrid, as economic prospects are hardly rosy there. In addition, his father's health is failing and he needs Carlos to help. In this town, where the elders still celebrate the medieval rites, Carlos meets a young policeman Juan and they fall in love. A friendship ensues amidst age-old rituals and a crisis of a nation, all this set against a spectacular backdrop which seems somehow not of this world.","popularity":1.468,"poster_path":"/nvAKqepT2187gM2SoKucF7ao6kZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8697,"logo_path":"/dedjnLn70UGdQ5d0PBELGkEOzhf.png","name":"Salzgeber \u0026 Co.
