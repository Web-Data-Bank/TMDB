Paddle To The Ocean is a documentary film about using a banjo, a kayak and a bicycle to recover from Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. In 2011, Zac Crouse (musician, recreation therapist and expedition kayaker) toured his album 'You Plan To Do Nothing' from Ottawa ON to Halifax NS using only a sea kayak and a bicycle. It was a journey Zac had intended to do with his friend Corey; who sadly passed away while on a kayaking adventure with Zac in Nova Scotia. Paddle To The Ocean is a tribute to Zac's friend, but it also examines the stigma associated with mental illness while demonstrating the benefits of physical activity and music.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2013-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paddle to the Ocean","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
