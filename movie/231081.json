The audience is invited into a thoughtful conversation with the likes of Prof. Noam Chomsky, Dr. Mark Mirabello, Ramsey Kanaan, and the riveting final interview with beloved author, Joe Bageant. These unique thought leaders cast a rare shadow of doubt over our most blindly accepted American traditions.","popularity":0.656,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":17851,"logo_path":null,"name":"Slowboat Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2011-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The worst prison is ignorance.","title":"The Kingdom of Survival","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
