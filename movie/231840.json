We met Joana in a casting that took place in Setubal, in the Bela Vista neighborhood. She appeared to us as a porcelain doll, small, fragile, pale, with a little hair bow. Little by little, she crumbled apart, revealing a charming complexity. We were conquered by the duality of strength and fragility, freedom and incarceration, joy and sorrow. The intimacy and complicity we were able to establish with her made this film possible. In Cat's Cradle, we share her with everyone else.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2Y1U9S2e7YuUO0WeMpVVM4TuhlP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114950,"logo_path":null,"name":"Câmara Municipal de Setúbal","origin_country":""},{"id":17937,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vende-Se Filmes","origin_country":"PT"},{"id":114951,"logo_path":null,"name":"European Union","origin_country":""},{"id":114952,"logo_path":null,"name":"POR Lisboa","origin_country":""},{"id":114953,"logo_path":null,"name":"Quadro de Referência Estrategico Nacional","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2012-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cat's Cradle","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4}
