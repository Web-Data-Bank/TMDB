The weather was all that could be desired, and the films are, therefore, very fine photographically. There are five scenes in all, as follows: 1. An automobile ride down San Francisco's busy Market Street, showing the elaborate decorations, crowds of people, traffic, etc. A very novel and effective picture.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1903-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Over Route of Roosevelt Parade in an Automobile","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
