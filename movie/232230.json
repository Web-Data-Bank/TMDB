For them, the war is never far off. Many of these traumatised refugees have lived here for years, with little food, no work and no prospect of returning home. Zuchuat took his camera to the camp and captured their uncertain existence without providing any comment. He captures the refugees' arduous daily life in long shots, often from a single angle. They all have their own stories of how they ended up here, how they saw their families and fellow-villagers perish and no longer have any work, cattle or land. Another striking story is told by a child that uses a drawing to explain how he was chased away from his native village. Little girls sing a battle song while waiting for what comes next in this prison without bars.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uWDtpewt4PrwzCBkffaw9fMENZZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":182327,"logo_path":null,"name":"Prince Film SA","origin_country":""},{"id":33562,"logo_path":null,"name":"AMIP","origin_country":""},{"id":182328,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films du Mélangeur","origin_country":""},{"id":13668,"logo_path":"/azhapBvZ8g1UWyyQQhhcRR9bM9x.png","name":"RTS","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":182329,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cooperazione Internazionale","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Far from the Villages","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
