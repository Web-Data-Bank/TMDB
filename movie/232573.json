While famous as an actor – the eponymous hero in the BBC hit Jonathan Creek – and a household star for his role as Stephen Fry’s foil on QI, Alan was sorely missed from live stand-up. His first show back is a glorious insight into Alan’s unique worldview – growing up in the ‘70s, losing his mother as a little boy, the vagaries of Facebook, sex toys and being a father are just some of the subjects he tackles.","popularity":1.32,"poster_path":"/pvBbstOGmKZmHVUytX2uQYUUpxu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alan Davies: Life Is Pain","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":3}
