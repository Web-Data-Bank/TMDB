But now that they’re older, the two brothers are road-weary and eager to take advantage of the perks of young adulthood. When the authorities discover their whereabouts, they are forced to move yet again and Pierre, the elder, disappears. Alone with his father on an island in the Loire River, Sylvain meets Gilda: his first girl, his first crush, and the first stop on his way to “the good life” – his own.","popularity":1.412,"poster_path":"/5C2Ab5g9xQeKdjdjS0RYyAVChrJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7191,"logo_path":"/8HH0YAxmfMPenWLCDkl4tVLvIbP.png","name":"Mezzanine Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2013-08-27","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Good Life","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":15}
