He works in the woods as a forest labourer repairing roads and enclosures, cutting wood to sell and assisting the foresters. Marketa earns a living as a masseuse and alternative healer, making use of various mind-altering plants and mushrooms, which leads to conflict with the old inhabitants and eventually with drug enforcement. Daughter Anyna attends a distant school where her grades deteriorate as she wanders the woods learning from nature rather than from her textbooks.","popularity":1.125,"poster_path":"/nNbXGLBA7aloVqfqhRQ5tlYgqZb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24941,"logo_path":null,"name":"VorelFilm","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":487,"logo_path":"/x3BUIowxU2skXOpnOeOkl7kIYDo.png","name":"Česká televize","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":77679,"logo_path":"/2NQQrorM3yjIkVmlTEqnjg9jdge.png","name":"Magiclab","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2012-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To the Woods","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":6}
