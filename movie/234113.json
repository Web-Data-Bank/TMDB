The wandering  ronin is reminiscent of his most famous role as the samurai without a name in  Kurosawa's \"Yojimbo\" and \"Sanjuro\". He travels about Japan, and while he may seek  happiness, violence and tragedy always cross his path. This time it is a woman  carrying a young infant who he encounters on the road that leads him into a tale of  violence, intrigue and a village in uproar. A great story and cool action scenes, a movie  not to be missed!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nZRTLAHjuXAppcuCex6KKjq7VjO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":68511,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mifune Productions","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":3341,"logo_path":"/dTG5dXE1kU2mpmL9BNnraffckLU.png","name":"Fuji Television Network","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1982-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lowly Ronin 2: The Spray of Blood","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
