There's some decent action that delivers a high body count, but the rushed production and editing that was obviously and clumsily done to avoid a Category III rating regulates this to being just another average Hong Kong cops and robbers flick.","popularity":1.6,"poster_path":"/1Zj74OyuaKbqirQWp2QS21vzJFX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22067,"logo_path":null,"name":"Johnny Mak Production Co.
