All the birds are nesting- that is, all but Goose Beary. She just sits, gazing longingly out the window at happy birds. A car horn and loud voice brings Charlie Beary to the window. It seems that Charlie and his friend Pete have a golf date. Charlie leaves his hatful of golf balls on a chair as he gets his clubs. Goose finds them and happily sits on them, mistaking them for goose eggs.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":8520,"logo_path":null,"name":"Walter Lantz Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1963-07-29","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Goose in the Rough","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
