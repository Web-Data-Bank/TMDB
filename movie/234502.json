He is a man with diverse qualities. Basically he is a moneylender, but not the avaricious kind. He lends money at very low interest-rates but makes it a point to get his money back on the date agreed upon.  The story takes a turn when a bank, named Grand Bank opens up in the village, offering to give out loans at very low interest. The manager of the bank is a young lady named Jayalakshmi. She has made her entry into the village with a very definite purpose. All this, plus the very different kind of bonding between Gopalakrishna Pillai and his mother, form the plot, which develops towards a very interesting climax.","popularity":1.61,"poster_path":"/fZpPYqgddtdE0QpJLibJqU7tji0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18110,"logo_path":null,"name":"Surya Cinemas","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2008-07-04","revenue":2200000,"runtime":145,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malayalam","iso_639_1":"ml","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Feudal Lord","title":"Madambi","video":false,"vote_average":5.692,"vote_count":13}
