As the move to scythe down whole forests progresses, there is less and less use for these elephants: heavy machinery works more efficiently in a clear-cutting situation. In this story, a young elephant keeper manages to save the life of a forest ranger, dedicated to keeping the national forest preserves safe from poaching. The elephant-keeper, on the other hand, is economically compelled to work for the poachers in order to keep his family fed, and to preserve the family lands from sale by a greedy businessman who once loaned them money.","popularity":1.21,"poster_path":"/jRUgIFj7PUiOQ23ncsbi01iy695.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":166564,"logo_path":null,"name":"Prommitr Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"1990-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":136,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Elephant Keeper","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4}
