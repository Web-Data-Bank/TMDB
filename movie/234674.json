And Juko has always loved Rory. But he's never been able to tell her how he feels because the timing has always been wrong. After a childhood spent crashing their teacher's car and building crazy mechanical contraptions trying to impress her, Jed and Juko find themselves all grown up. And now Rory is married. So much for timing. This leaves them only one option. They must build a time machine so Juko can go back and capture her heart before she gets engaged. But the clock is ticking. Jed's wife Nina is pregnant and she's not a fan of the idea. They quickly discover that building the time machine turns out to be the least of their problems.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gfgdvqMzdjQAA36zgXekHvUt8cm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"I love her.
