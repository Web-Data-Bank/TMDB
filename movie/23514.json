Adopting the rum-soaked lifestyle of the late ‘50s version of Hemingway’s 'The Lost Generation', Paul soon becomes entangled with a very attractive American woman and her fiancée, a businessman involved in shady property development deals.  It is within this world that Kemp ultimately discovers his true voice as a writer and integrity as a man.","popularity":10.088,"poster_path":"/h0q4RUuc1CbKWwEtH3nt7KPcPWL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":816,"logo_path":null,"name":"FilmEngine","origin_country":""},{"id":3281,"logo_path":"/pfmb82VUfN9VKB1YuBSY69WVNVm.png","name":"GK Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":2691,"logo_path":"/Uas6Nps2Y58s9eRyoTHXgfEuZj.png","name":"Infinitum Nihil","origin_country":"US"},{"id":7263,"logo_path":"/auaadhBBcvvTDtmW2iJzOrEjfgO.png","name":"FilmDistrict","origin_country":"US"},{"id":181992,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mandate International","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-10-13","revenue":24000000,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"One part outrage.
