This is the tale of three objects in the box and the people behind them, all in some way incapable of relating to the person they love most. It is also a tale of the box itself, and of how Esmeralda learns to open it, to feel and to hoard the most valuable thing of all: human relations.","popularity":1.47,"poster_path":"/uM27P8FtwSTEXmyJ6dTrQ7jNZVD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":56674,"logo_path":null,"name":"Manga Films","origin_country":""},{"id":11628,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tequila Gang","origin_country":"MX"},{"id":174,"logo_path":"/IuAlhI9eVC9Z8UQWOIDdWRKSEJ.png","name":"Warner Bros.
