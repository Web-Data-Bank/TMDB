He shot the film in the Paris studios and also in Spain, Andalusia and Seville. According to the critics, his story of love, honour, revenge, bulls and vineyards masterfully captures the spirit of this region, the sun beating down on the parched earth, life on the farms and vineyards and the celebrations coloured by the famous flamenco dance. Wine Cellars was originally a silent film and its soundtrack was only added later.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/lZwY9HkyTvGm4OrtOJuFkW9AH4Q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80925,"logo_path":null,"name":"Compagnie Générale Cinématographique (CGC)","origin_country":""},{"id":193892,"logo_path":null,"name":"Julio César","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1930-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wine Cellars","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3}
