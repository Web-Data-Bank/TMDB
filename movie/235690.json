Famous for their quiet, beautiful slow songs, and fascinating harmonies, as well as their religious background (core members Alan Sparhawk and Mimi Parker are Mormons). For this documentary, a film crew followed Alan and Mimi on tour, at home in Duluth, MN, in their church community, and as parents. It's more than an on-the-road or behind-the-scenes video. It shows Sparhawk as the ambivalent main character in an intriguing movie about religion, violence, conscience, and madness. It can also be seen as a touching love story.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Low: You May Need a Murderer","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":2}
