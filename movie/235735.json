His friends from the previous films and the director himself play out a riotous farce about an overgrown baby who steals his fatherâ€™s cigars. Everyone mugs hilariously. The movie could be taken as another example of the Romantic notion of the artist as a monstrous child or misfit, or a parody of the same rather than the personal confessional statement seen so often in these film movements.","popularity":0.779,"poster_path":"/cPRyxiQxFESoCVpluOD7T6JG6s2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1954-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Extraordinary Child","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":6}
