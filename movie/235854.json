Maw and Paw and their kids live on a farm and can be described as a rural family with below average intelligence (their pet pig, Milford, is regarded in the opening titles as the \"Smart One\"). At dinner, Milford answers a phone-in quiz contest correctly and wins a new car for the family. The problem is no one in the family knows how to drive it (Maw thinks the antenna is a \"new fangled clothesline\").","popularity":0.624,"poster_path":"/uGgHyBUsnZEax3uwNFLGaNsmHOn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8520,"logo_path":null,"name":"Walter Lantz Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1953-08-09","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maw and Paw","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
