Spanning five games and just as many decades of fictional history, Metal Gear Saga ties together the game's complex narrative in chronological order, from the 1960's-with the heroic origins of Big Boss in Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater-to the cliffhanger conclusion of Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, set in the early 21st century. Metal Gear series creator Hideo Kojima also appears in a series of candid interviews, recounting the origins of the series and sharing its secrets, such as the original setting of Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, his thoughts on the infamous NES game Snake's Revenge, and what gamers can look forward to in the forthcoming Metal Gear Solid 4.","popularity":1.207,"poster_path":"/2w0x3ar2vvSHcsdWN8wHqzJqAmR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12309,"logo_path":"/xoYgdgk27t7FO6dGKuuLfGkgXkR.png","name":"Kojima Productions","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":55914,"logo_path":"/fLZm5yRhOmaYb82wvCMOPiClMMB.png","name":"Konami","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2006-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Metal Gear Saga: Vol. 1","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1}
