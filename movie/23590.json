Brant finds out that 'Jones', one of the outlaws he has become friends with, committed the murder that Brant was sent up for, but has no knowledge that anyone was ever put in jail for his crime. Willing to forgive and forget, Brant doesn't realize that 'Jones' has not only fallen for the same pretty shopgirl Brant has, but begins to suspect that Brant is not truly an outlaw.","popularity":3.395,"poster_path":"/uxm8acBhegMZ42692iS06x8odFi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4114,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lone Star","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1933-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Romance rides in a drama of thundering hoofs and blazing guns!","title":"Sagebrush Trail","video":false,"vote_average":5.455,"vote_count":33}
