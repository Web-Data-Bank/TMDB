As usual, Bluto has a million ways to cheat, and Popeye overcomes all of them to win. Some of the bits: Popeye's suit is connected to a fish hook; the fish unravels it and Popeye knits it back together. Bluto is on a raft and blows sneezing powder at Popeye. Bluto attaches a magnet to Popeye which attracts a mine (which ends up blowing Popeye much closer to the line). Bluto dumps a load of cement on Popeye.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/t6BlDGeXRjeLkzJrbasDCGuKItj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4178,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1952-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Swimmer Take All","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
