Mountain guide Bluto spots them through binoculars, and goes crazy over Olive. He immediately intercepts them and tries to convince them they need a professional guide. Popeye resists, so Bluto uses a number of tricks: cutting the rope, burning a bridge they are crossing, using a magnet to break Popeye's climbing pick. Olive finally has had enough, and goes off with Bluto, who promptly gets her alone in a dark cave. Her screams bring Popeye, whose battle with Bluto carves a Mount Rushmore replica in a mountain-top. Bluto knocks Popeye into a snowbank, where a Saint Bernard dog revives him with spinach (after consulting a handy Popeye comic book). Popeye bashes Bluto into a mountain, forming a Paramount logo.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bSM5OzB52A1EdapoYXB4UayEyxJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4178,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1951-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alpine for You","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
