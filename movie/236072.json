Popeye wants to dance a waltz, pull taffy, play pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey and croquet, and bob for apples, but Olive turns up her nose at all these as Bluto sabotages them. Finally, Bluto pours quick-drying cement in the apple water and drives off with Olive. Popeye, encased in cement, rolls downhill into a vegetable shop, right next to a bin of spinach. Good thing, because Bluto's getting fresh in a very old-fashioned way. A zoot-suited Popeye stops him, and gets the girl.","popularity":0.627,"poster_path":"/yzhw4OugKyZbbfbl3kp0j3ZLjzA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4178,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1950-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jitterbug Jive","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
