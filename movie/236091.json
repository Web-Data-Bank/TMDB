Fortunately, or unfortunately, the boys are driving by. They compete for the job. Chores: Getting water from a well, picking apples, shoeing a horse, gathering eggs. Popeye feeds a hen a little spinach, and she produces a mountain of eggs, which eventually end up all over Bluto. Bluto drops an anvil on Popeye, then goes after Olive against her wishes, chasing her into a succession of haystacks (where he finds a needle!). The chicken feeds Popeye his spinach, and he triumphs, sending Bluto into the pigpen (where the pigs won't have anything to do with him).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/91m5Cw9BbeQhxQLlSZcDHzmtZGF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4178,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1950-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Farmer and the Belle","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
