The statue of Nero comes to life and tries to burn the nearby painting of Rome but his matches go out. He tries to get a set of \"hear no evil\" monkeys to take the matches from a still life, but they refuse and he teases them. The other artworks come to their defense. Nero plays hurt, and gets the monkeys to help; after they stumble around in the still life for a while, they get drunk on lighter fluid and start breathing flames, which they combine with the fluid to act as a flamethrower. Soon, the museum is ablaze and all the paintings are either sounding the alarm or coming to fight the fire.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":89238,"logo_path":null,"name":"MGM Cartoon Studio","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1939-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Art Gallery","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
