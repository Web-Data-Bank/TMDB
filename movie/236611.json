When the dog awakes, the mouse hides in a hen's nest, and the cat disguises himself as a hen - and even does a hen imitation when the chicks hatch. The mouse then keeps pointing out the cat's hiding places, but when he points to a dump where the cat isn't hiding, the dog turns on him. The mouse paints an apple black and lights the fuse, but it explodes and sends him to mouse heaven.","popularity":0.741,"poster_path":"/d7E3OIqLurMdxFBjcvZiJ9qw5zh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1942-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Double Chaser","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":5}
