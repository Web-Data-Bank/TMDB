They are given the plans for a battleship; whichever finishes first gets the contract for the fleet. Bluto does his patriotic duty by refraining from his usual sabotage; his own incompetence provides much of the entertainment, until the end, when Popeye finishes first. Bluto, invited to help launch the ship, provides a bottle of champagne filled with nitroglycerine. Popeye's ship is destroyed, but after his spinach, he manages to turn out a ship every 5 seconds or so, launching an entire fleet for the war effort.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4AuS89Q2IkM0y14SWBlVpozzN8w.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4178,"logo_path":null,"name":"Famous Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1942-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Hull of a Mess","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
