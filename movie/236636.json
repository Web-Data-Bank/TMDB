He falls for an Indian maiden with a Brooklyn accent, but her very large boyfriend catches them. Daffy dresses in drag, which fools him for a while until Daffy's wig falls off. The boyfriend chases Daffy into the Petrified Forest (where Daffy freezes and breaks tomahawks). The Indian sends smoke signals from a phone booth and his tribe attacks Daffy, trapping him under his house trailer.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/n3MsqXIGzqvC9xCwkzdmO7y7CXD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134798,"logo_path":null,"name":"Leon Schlesinger Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1942-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Daffy Duckaroo","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":8}
