She is diagnosed with Rhabdomyosarcoma (a cancer of connective tissues), which is unusual at her age. After undergoing twenty-five sessions of chemotherapy, the once healthy and beautiful Keke finds herself sickly and bald, with a disfigured face. Although the treatment initially works, the cancer returns a year later. Doctors estimate that Keke has three months to live. To help her deal with her pain, she begins keeping a diary; through her writing she finds the strength to hold on for a year. As she begins to accept her fate, she writes a letter to God in her diary, asking that her family be kept safe.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/s2lPM7DTVuEfRA3vWiYwSam5mnQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22614,"logo_path":null,"name":"Skylar Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"2011-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Surat Kecil untuk Tuhan","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
