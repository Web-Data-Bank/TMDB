The always-delectable (except when drawn by the Columbia animators on this cartoon series) Miss Daisy Mae Scragg is heartbroken as she does not share Abner's admiration of the two bachelors--a strictly platonic relationship---who share a cave pad outside the Dogpatch city limits. Neither does Mammy Yokum and she sets out to help Hairless Joe and Lonesome Polecat in a search for a wife, although Hairless Joe and Lonesome Polecat are not aware they are in the matrimony market nor that a search is in progress.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1944-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kickapoo Juice","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
