His sole hat is eaten by moths so he goes to Wally Walrus' hat store to purchase a new one (and, for once, does not give Wally a hard time). After a few attempts to get the hat to fit Woody's head, he buys the hat but it blows away landing on a goose in a meadow. After tussling with the goose, he gets his head back but loses his job at the studio anyway.","popularity":0.681,"poster_path":"/k4qI7j5QMv9HPuRIxboeYOCVP2T.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8520,"logo_path":null,"name":"Walter Lantz Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1948-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mad Hatter","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":3}
