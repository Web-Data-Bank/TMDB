In sensuous, lyric styling, Askarian employs dreamlike images to reflect the history of his homeland, tranquil childhood memories, images inspired by erotic medieval poetry, and autobiographical shades of his own exile in Germany.","popularity":1.2,"poster_path":"/nGG3pJwR5QzqdWBZuE0kTEq4PZY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97832,"logo_path":null,"name":"Margarita Woskanjan Filmproduktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AM","name":"Armenia"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1992-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Armenian","iso_639_1":"hy","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Avetik","video":false,"vote_average":8.4,"vote_count":8}
