John Harris, journalist and author of The Last Party - the definitive study of the entwinement of music and politics in the 1990s - presents a documentary charting the rise of Britpop, its brief romance with New Labour and the emergence of 'new lad' culture. Finally, as Britpop declines, he asks what legacy it has left.  Including contributions from Blur's Graham Coxon, Elastica's Justine Frischmann, Sleeper's Louise Wener, former New Labour insider Darren Kalynuk, and the founder of Creation records, Alan McGee.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/x8YxiAYW05GYI9aWObFQUzmggZF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Britpop Story 'It Really, Really, Really, Could Happen'","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
