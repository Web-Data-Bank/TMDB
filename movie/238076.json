One day, Om unexpectedly meets a pretty high school girl and suddenly falls in love with her. He then tries to win her heart with the help of his followers by disguising as a high school boy. While Om is in love and lacks the ability to rule, the stability of the gang is now wobbled; a new enemy arrives, new problems keep happening in the gang, and the love affair is complicated.
