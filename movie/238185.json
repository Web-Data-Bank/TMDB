Did Jesus have it? What about Che Guevara, Gandhi, Malcolm X and Hitler? All these men have shaped our lives and influenced the way we think. Their images are used to represent ideas that often do not relate to them at all. Would Gandhi be into Apple? Would Che Guevara endorse Madonna? Would Jesus be into Christianity? He concludes it’s all a load of rubbish and encourages the audience to stop voting, ignore advertising, look to the transcendent within themselves and others...and kick over some bins on their way home. Plus there’s sex. Obviously.","popularity":3.099,"poster_path":"/3vvigE3kZ1bteqOnDCqYJreonzJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Russell Brand: Messiah Complex","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":33}
