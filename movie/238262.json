During Chile's transition from dictatorship to democracy (1988-1990), they forge a path from drug- and drink-fuelled nihilism and petty crime into the world of market-driven illegality and Niki begins a seemingly predestined relationship with the middle-class \"loca\", Manuela. Memorable episodes and characters, quotable dialogue and a mix of earthy national portrait and surrealistic flourish make this one of the key Chilean films of the Nineties.","popularity":0.623,"poster_path":"/n7YtI2UgiWFIJU7ftw11Csapd26.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21403,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arca","origin_country":"CL"},{"id":75685,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmocentro","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1990-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Caluga o Menta","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
