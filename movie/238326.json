We all know what white van man thinks about the world we live in but it's time to hear a different voice, the purple van man's voice. Filled with gags, opinions, deft observations and some silly voices, this is Sean Lock doing what he does best, spouting inspired jibber jabber as he crosses the country in his purple van. He will make you laugh like a drunken horse.","popularity":1.688,"poster_path":"/1AZJFINXgphliybGDrc8Dz6Sp0g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4400,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Pictures UK","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sean Lock: Purple Van Man","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":9}
