When they accomplish their mission, Abou Ahmed, freed Abdou and others escape because now they're wanted, but on a promise to return and to continue fighting.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bRWixJ9CdqQtMP6JZwK4XRmiAWR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":56027,"logo_path":null,"name":"Phenicia Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"}],"release_date":"1967-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Safar Barlek","video":false,"vote_average":8.3,"vote_count":6}
