Documentary interviews, speeches, press conferences and  demonstrations are sampled, taken apart, and set to music, replayed this time as operatic scenes. A surreal fictional  narrative is intercut with the stories of their struggles against government and the pharmaceutical industry. In this  fictional world, Gertrude Stein decides to write a tragic opera about Tim and Zackie and their saint-like heroism.  She kidnaps them, transports them to Niagara Falls, and forces them to sing a series of complicated avant-garde  vocal compositions. However, when Zackie ends his treatment strike and starts taking his pills, Gertrude realizes  that there will be no more tragedy, and thus, no more opera.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2009-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fig Trees","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
