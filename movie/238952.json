Reviews its history and famous visitors; displays its faux-exotic buildings, its crowded beaches, its trees and monuments; and, pokes fun at the colors women wear and the vagaries of fashion. The film celebrates the use of \"Eden\" as a place name, suggesting that paradise comes to the coast after all are gone, perhaps only on a remote island beach.","popularity":2.611,"poster_path":"/5bETPcUHBEPsSuNxquiisAs2uUv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6116,"logo_path":null,"name":"Argos Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1958-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A humorous travelogue of the French Riviera.","title":"Along the Coast","video":false,"vote_average":7.702,"vote_count":42}
