Their twenties are the age of freedom, of fast-changing events and intense emotions. Perhaps only at this age they can live a whole life in one day.\r A young girl and her two accident companions walk halfway around St.-Petersburg; they flirt and tease each other, and for ninety minutes they act out a real-time romantic drama. This stroll is full of laughter and tears against a backdrop of the hustle and bustle of the streets.","popularity":1.752,"poster_path":"/oHTuBUVpBMqtbdahqIS9ll9k3kR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42673,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rock Films","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":15755,"logo_path":"/cZDbkvJPOnzHlmu2CDx05DcEnaf.png","name":"Ministry of Culture of the Russian Federation","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":684231,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Stroll","video":false,"vote_average":6.406,"vote_count":32}
