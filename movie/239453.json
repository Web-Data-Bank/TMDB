Smolders has basically taken a standard documentary and chopped it up, using quotes from the long-dead artist, and periodic statements by a historian (Smolders) filling in a few bits of Wiertz’ life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oDWYpp1CdqJzw7tOxISlRU5Aan1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75954,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films de la Boissière","origin_country":""},{"id":75424,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films du Scarabée","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thoughts and Visions of a Severed Head","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
