Shot on Super 8 over 3 years, the film exhibits the kind of intimacy of filmmaker and subject found in the works of Tacon’s thesis director, Jean Rouch. The film is also a late example of the kind of collaborative militant cinema that the Medvedkin Group and others pioneered in the years after May ‘68. - Brian Rajski","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mfcghKblQ9ifBftnX4ODE5OwMpw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cochon qui s’en dédit","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
