One day, while fighting with her sister over her marriage prospects, Petchara says too much, claiming that she will marry whoever eats her Pad Thai for 100 days straight. Wiwat, a local TV producer, senses an opportunity and quickly sets up a game show, \"Pad Thai's Love,\" to contest for a Bt1 million prize and Petchara's hand in marriage.
