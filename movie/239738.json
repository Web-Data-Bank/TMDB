His first conquest is the banker's daughter who helps him loot the bank in exchange for a promise of marriage; he wanders over to the saloon and runs the crooked partner of the proprietress out of town, takes all of his-and-her money and leaves her, between kisses, hounding him for her share; the third one, the saloon singer, actually makes a mark out of him as she cons him into a boxing match against a professional fighter and he loses the fight and his money, but he holds the singer and the fighter up as they leave town and gets his money back; and then he romances and swindles Cattle Kate, a replay of what he had done somewhere before to Kate.","popularity":2.384,"poster_path":"/p6gIgBuT3aqV1XvbipAjzF0Eub0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109543,"logo_path":null,"name":"Panorama Pictures Corp.","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1954-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"ROARING WITH EXCITEMENT!...And the Women Who Made the West Wonderful, Wild and Deadly!","title":"Jesse James' Women","video":false,"vote_average":4.4,"vote_count":8}
