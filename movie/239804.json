The company's CEO manages to sidestep blame by framing a meddling young reporter (Katherine), who now holds the only surviving evidence needed to expose the truth. All the while, the dangerous nanoparticles - having escaped from the explosion into the stratosphere - threaten to destroy nearby cities with wildly destructive weather patterns. Among the chaos of the storms, and on the run from the authorities, Katherine must - with the help of a young scientist - get the evidence to the government to enlist their help before it's too late...and the deadly disaster turns worldwide.","popularity":4.421,"poster_path":"/hrgQE2JRt4TWh6NE6YM3S3hYzpD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":50453,"logo_path":null,"name":"Armored Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":4774,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sci Fi Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":4190,"logo_path":null,"name":"United Film Organization","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Path of Destruction","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":14}
