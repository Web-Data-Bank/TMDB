Everything was planned for us to start shooting in April 2005. But reality did not wait. On the last day of March, exactly one month before shooting was scheduled to begin, things changed: A terrible massacre took place in Baixada Fluminense, near the city of Rio de Janeiro. Twenty-nine people were killed by a death squad, the largest massacre in the history of Rio de Janeiro. The killers are extermination groups made up of policemen who work in the area, and who are involved in extortions, kidnapping, drug dealing and homicide. This has been going on since the 1950s, but it has never been as extreme as it is today","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jeSDgAmswAxXQ5pDva3XNm3Ep4Z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2006-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"PortuguÃªs"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Acts of Men","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
