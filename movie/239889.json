It argues that the magic bullet that hit JFK and Governor John Connally was in fact possible. The documentary also features other home movies taken on the day.","popularity":2.641,"poster_path":"/vzQICVAfko1BRfVoZ7uSqqwoOgN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"JFK: The Lost Bullet","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
