Witness firsthand one of the hip-hop generation's leading comedians in his first stand-up broadcast, originally aired on HBO in 1997. VooDoo Child will keep you laughing through a virtual comedic drive-by that hits all of its targets: racism, sexism, homosexuality, education, religion, the Bible and Michael Jackson, not necessarily in that order. No person, group or creed is spared as with great skill and wit Eddie verbally pounces on everything and everybody and keeps it real in the process. Here's hip-hop comedy on the edge, filled with rage and loaded with truth!","popularity":1.173,"poster_path":"/us4rE7nsIAEW1weyeCDbNO3RsTZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1997-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eddie Griffin: Voodoo Child","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":8}
