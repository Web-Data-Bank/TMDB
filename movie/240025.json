Featuring a rhythmic soundscape and paint-on-glass animation, the film shows a woman’s hands reaching in and out of the frame, cutting and editing a reel of film on a flatbed editing table. She splices, scrubs, rewinds and rolls the sound and images. Fragments of animated archival footage flash across the screen: women walking in chains, protesting with placards, speaking at podiums. We hear bursts of words and the percussive whir and click of the Steenbeck—until a “message” is finally revealed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Assembly","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
