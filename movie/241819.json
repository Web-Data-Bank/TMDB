Both Hays' outlaws and a rival gang headed by Heesman, have been hired as ranch hands by \"Bull\" Herrick, a cripple who owns a large cattle ranch and wants to get his large herd to market. He theorizes that the two gangs will be kept busy watching each other and neither will rustle his cattle. Helen has little faith in her brother's contrived plan, and hates and distrusts both groups. She begins to soften toward Jim, but abruptly changes when she sees a reward poster which says he has killed two men.","popularity":0.951,"poster_path":"/tVY6GVgsHIWpik3fyduw8nrEMDy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60,"logo_path":"/1SEj4nyG3JPBSKBbFhtdcHRaIF9.png","name":"United Artists","origin_country":"US"},{"id":46974,"logo_path":null,"name":"Goldstein-Jacks Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1955-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"THE MOST SAVAGE KILLERS LAIR IN THE WEST!...If You Rode In With A Badge On Your Chest---You Were Carried Out With A Bullet In Your Back!","title":"Robbers' Roost","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":9}
