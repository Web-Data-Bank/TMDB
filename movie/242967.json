Magoo refuses but the salesman is eventually able to sell Magoo some by posing as one of Magoo's old college chums. Magoo is now worth a hefty sum and is ready to collect after being bitten by a dog (actually a tiger rug) but, instead of going to the insurance building, enters a building under construction next door to it. The salesman and his boss notice Magoo walking around the steel skeleton of the building and realizing, \"If he falls, the company falls\", they rush over making several attempts to save Magoo's life and keep him from endangering himself.","popularity":0.711,"poster_path":"/9fTjYiP1sPkKaCZ6RnTBNvmYyUl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8409,"logo_path":null,"name":"United Productions of America (UPA)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1950-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trouble Indemnity","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4}
