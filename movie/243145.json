Sibrel made this film as a follow-up to his 2001 video A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Moon, which accuses NASA of falsifying the Apollo 11 mission photography. The title of the film is a wordplay on the Girls Gone Wild video series.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":262,"logo_path":null,"name":"Independent Film Distributors","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An Investigation Into the Authenticity of the Moon Landings","title":"Astronauts Gone Wild: An Investigation Into the Authenticity of the Moon Landings","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
