The film is a dramatization of a farmerâ€™s last day on his ancestral farm on Prince Edward Island as he is faced with the Public Auction of his family home and possessions. On the one hand, it is a simple, poignant tale of personal loss, alienation and the displacement of the old at the end of life. On the other, it is a political statement about the loss of Canadian Heritage, land and economy to foreign capital. It was nominated for an Academy Award (Short Subject) in 1972. It was named Best Documentary at the 24th Canadian Film Awards.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zWfxvoQOp3LYGSHTboJjpMlKqdj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1972-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Selling Out","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
