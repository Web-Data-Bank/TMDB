Filmed in Zaire, Kenya and Tanzania, the film takes the viewer from deep inside an anthill, to the majestic giraffes suckling their young, African storms, dung beetle ritual dances, duels for supremacy, feeding time and playtime all end, as the animals disappear one by one while the sound of a rifle shatters the existing magic of life.","popularity":1.299,"poster_path":"/7pi7D69hgRh2JaE14F9b2HdChpi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112790,"logo_path":null,"name":"Opus Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1976-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The End of the Game","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":6}
