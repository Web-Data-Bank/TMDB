Inspired by Indian spiritual master Meher Baba, Pete Townshend created the character of Tommy, the 'deaf, dumb and blind boy'. Broke and fragmenting when they started recording, the album went on to sell over 20 million copies. In this film, the Who speak for the first time about the making of the iconic album and how its success changed their lives.","popularity":0.654,"poster_path":"/n20zI0NLXopZPAFZQmA8FKufIx4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Who - The Making of Tommy","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":2}
