Especially, if you're five years old and that bank has just thrown your parents out of a brand new apartment, because your father has lost his job.  Five year old Robby is no Zorro, but he'd like to be.  His seven year old sister Louise thinks he's too childish, but can't resist the game of robbing a bank.  Together they can pull off just about anything. Getting away with it is the hard part.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/rnHwJ6X94MiY4EejZHwDgVANocW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112128,"logo_path":null,"name":"F.O.R.M.A","origin_country":"LV"},{"id":2616,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mini Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"},{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2009-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Little Robbers","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":3}
