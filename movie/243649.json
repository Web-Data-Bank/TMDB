Until one day, when the first woman, Toli, who was brave and adventurous traveled deep into the forest. Toli discovered solitary creatures with big muscles who knew how to climb trees and harvest wild honey. When Toli tasted their honey, she thought they should all live together….” That is how one of the creation stories of the Aka people from the tropical rainforest of the Congo Basin goes. Akaya, Kengole, Dibota and their friends and family are hunters-gatherers (and also great story-tellers) who guide us through their world. They explain their origins, myths, and the very spiritual meaning of life.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/wNV8YDUTLFHekB9fMSAAOmcQRqs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38993,"logo_path":"/c4T0Dik4WZ9Nou4oD4ZXY5sgtPN.png","name":"EyeSteelFilm","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2013-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Lingala","iso_639_1":"ln","name":""},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forest of the Dancing Spirits","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
