The camera catches the subjects indulging in all the (post) modern lifestyle trends: drugs, kinky sex, hip-hop, fashion, exhibitionism, narcissism. They are uninhibited, the kind of youth who break down barriers in a supposedly traditional and religious society, but perhaps that's just on the surface. Behind the upbeat tone is a probing examination of values and attitudes in modern youth relationships. Happiness may be deceptive but there's certainly a lot of fun in the Happy Berry.","popularity":0.711,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Happy Berry","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4}
