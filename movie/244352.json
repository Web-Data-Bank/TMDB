It captures the normal conflicts of early childhood -- the quick changes from happiness to sorrow, from cooperative play to tears and arguments -- all the while keeping these conflicts in perspective; showing them within the framework of the joy that the boys find in each other's presence. A wonderful children's film that enchants adults as well.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6qJuow5JXyv5HRUi6c9ICvxeogM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1979-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oh Brother, My Brother","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":1}
