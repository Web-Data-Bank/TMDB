A seemingly minor accident - a cut on his right thumb - led to dystonia, the involuntary curling of his right hand's ring and little fingers. In recent interviews, Fleisher talks about what followed: the end of a marriage, despair and disappointments, surgery in 1983 that led to a brief return to the concert hall, and, finally, with Botox and Rolfing, the ability to play with two hands. In between, Fleisher discovers his ecstasies: conducting, teaching, and playing compositions for one hand commissioned in the early twentieth century for a World War I veteran.","popularity":0.712,"poster_path":"/bhIX0P5Ls82sT8Qra1bR6MeDd6v.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Hands: The Leon Fleisher Story","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":4}
