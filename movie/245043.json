Two marksmen - Robert, a Croat, and Stojan, a Serb - wander aimlessly through the desolate countryside. When their paths unexpectedly cross, the enemies immediately try to shoot each other. The first 'click', however, is not coming from a gun barrel, but from the ground beneath them: the enemies stepped on a landmine at the same time. One foot in the grave, they are involuntarily bound together by common destiny - the death of one means the death of the other. But not just their apparent differences make it difficult for them to overcome their dilemma. Nature, too, offers some challenges to test the soldiers' solidarity and survival skills.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":14266,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filoufilm","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"}],"release_date":"2012-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"},{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
