Surrounded by an (to say the least) unlikely group of assorted hangers-on and supporters, such as a lesbian golf instructor, an ex-girlfriend-turned-nemesis and an annoying caddy who'd be more at home on a surfboard, Tripp somehow manages to make the Tour. It's only then that the two drop-dead gorgeous, bikini-clad, space-gun-wielding aliens appear.  At times hilarious, at other times merely ridiculous, Fairway to Heaven tries to be Caddyshack, but too often more closely resembles Porky's.","popularity":0.628,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fairway to Heaven","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
