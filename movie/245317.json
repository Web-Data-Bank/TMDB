The credit for this goes squarely to Soham who puts in a sparklingly fresh and funny performance and dances well too in his image of a very ordinary and simple boy who is scared out of his wits with the threat of death hanging over him like Damocles’ sword. It feels good to finally meet a hero who is timid of his opponents, does not sport a six-abs body and is like most young men of his age.","popularity":1.8,"poster_path":"/1kMp37wWNIc53jVteAszJhrIVe8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12877,"logo_path":"/eKruM4v4KT0ILAK2NsDGne6qA7D.png","name":"SVF Entertainment","origin_country":"IN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2011-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":164,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Faande Poriya Boga Kande Re","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":3}
