For believers and skeptics alike, there is nothing in this world or the next to rival the relentless evil of a Voodoo Possession. Burdened since childhood with a gnawing sense of guilt, cynical Aiden Chase journeys to a Haitian insane asylum in search of his missing brother. Upon arriving, he discovers all the inmates and the hospital administrator (Danny Trejo, Machete) are seemingly possessed by a bloodthirsty voodoo spirit. Now, Aiden must abandon reality and descend into a terrifying spirit world to try to rescue his brother - or they will both be damned for eternity.","popularity":3.149,"poster_path":"/nuHQxaA1ei3flajBZgyFoqffQYR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84091,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jugular","origin_country":""},{"id":18926,"logo_path":null,"name":"B2FX","origin_country":""},{"id":18927,"logo_path":null,"name":"Front Row Media","origin_country":""},{"id":18928,"logo_path":null,"name":"Front Row Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":18929,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rough Riders Studios","origin_country":""},{"id":18930,"logo_path":null,"name":"Waltertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Fearing is Believing","title":"Voodoo Possession","video":false,"vote_average":3.24,"vote_count":25}
