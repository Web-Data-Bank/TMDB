Interspliced between performance footage of Scott-Heron and his Midnight Band are vignettes of him walking around Washington D.C., spouting his views on then-President Reagan (dubbed \"Ray-Gun\") and generally dropping knowledge. The live performance features many of Scott-Heron's best-known hits, including \"Johannesburg,\" \"Winter in America,\" and \"Angel Dust,\" among others. Warm, intelligent, and insightful throughout, Scott-Heron is clearly enjoying himself and the opportunity to espouse his views. A must for any fan of Scott-Heron's, and definitely worth a look for fans of the funkier jazz music of the mid to late 1970's.","popularity":1.371,"poster_path":"/shHcB6Pf2DjtkBPbIV7y0b6Uxqh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79393,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mug-Shot","origin_country":""},{"id":181,"logo_path":"/zhQ77XOviCBuXd74IurqqjgLNe0.png","name":"Channel Four Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1983-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"With The Most Dangerous Musician Alive, Gil Scott-Heron","title":"Black Wax","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
