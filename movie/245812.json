Buckets, film. Materiality, memory. Erosion, elision. Time, travel. Spiral, Jetty. Salt Lake, Dead Sea. Jennifer West’s fervent materialism is by now well documented—strewn as her films are with materials, which she then indexes in her paragraph-long titles—as are the dialectical relationships she plumbs with awesome hallucinatory fever. Likewise, her films Spiral of Time Documentary Film and Salt Crystals Spiral Jetty Dead Sea Five Year Film (both 2013) materialize—no, metabolize—more of these things. Travelogues in the elliptical way that Tony Conrad’s black painted frames on paper, his seventies-era “Yellow Movies,” were movies, West’s recent films are admixtures of shot images and abstract, material traces, in the acid-y palette that is her signature.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spiral of Time Documentary Film","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
