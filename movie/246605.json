The 49th day after death is considered crucial, as the date at which the soul passes from this world to the next and, therefore, the date from when the living are expected to get on with life.  But Yoko doesn't move on. The ache of the loss that simply won't heal takes an awful toll on her husband and friends, who try doggedly and unsuccessfully to help her move on, and to guide her away from the misguided and damaging belief that daughter Kanako's spirit has entered another living child (by sharptongue, IMDB.com)","popularity":1.124,"poster_path":"/uJcLJx21b8ywnrNHXqb1nCNWpLH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2013-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Orpheus' Lyre","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
