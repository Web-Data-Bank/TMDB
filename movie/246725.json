An evocative 1960s time capsule—reminiscent of Jim McBride’s \"David Holzman’s Diary\"—this simulated autobiography, as in many experimental films, often blurs the lines between reality and illusion, moving in non-linear arcs through the ever-evolving and unpredictable interactions of relationships, time and place. As Paul Schrader notes, \"it is probably quite impossible (and useless) to make a distinction between the point at which the film reflects their lives, and the point at which their lives reflect the film.\" \"Brandy in the Wilderness\" remains a little-known yet key work of American indie filmmaking.","popularity":0.621,"poster_path":"/f6gMweOe7LPJypg95EgdUrjBdgU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brandy in the Wilderness","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":1}
