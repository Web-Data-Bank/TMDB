His goal: cross the country using old Soviet roads while climbing as many of the region's impressive peaks as possible. He was alone. He carried only a minimal ration of climbing gear. Ten Kyrgyz words complete its vocabulary. Part meditation on the true spirit of adventure and part epic travelogue, The Road from Karakol is the story of a unique spirit who cycled to the end of the road and decided to keep going.","popularity":0.874,"poster_path":"/kVOTnOCq3XycSdDrhBhyZKgProe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19053,"logo_path":"/n9zDVIEiemxPe70wsPB89fS5GBC.png","name":"Duct Tape Then Beer","origin_country":"US"},{"id":19054,"logo_path":"/Jo2kDxxRbe7WlSoCkZs2WGpbMA.png","name":"5Point Film","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KG","name":"Kyrgyz Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Road From Karakol","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
