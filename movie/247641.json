In direct speech, sometimes to the camera, sometimes among themselves, the uneducated rural workers expose their misery, their suffering, their hopes, and ultimately their despair - when a socialist government orders the restitution of the land to their primitive owners, and these transform the land into a hunting reserve.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iOtTGU4i4XB7dJ1aZtZIGn1tlU6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19162,"logo_path":null,"name":"Società Cinematografica Italiana di Torre Bela","origin_country":""},{"id":132704,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cooperativa Era Nova","origin_country":""},{"id":132705,"logo_path":null,"name":"Albatros","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"1975-08-06","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Torre Bela","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":7}
