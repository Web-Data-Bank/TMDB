Their favourite activity: talking endlessly. During a series of vacation days filled with sun-drenched naps, squabbling, waterskiing competitions and love-making, the amateur actors discuss their concerns in dry dialogues. For instance, semi-intellectual reflections on the end of time and how Michael Jordan plays basketball.","popularity":1.843,"poster_path":"/tgmjp3dAb7EjtjnLMtaQQO6auDH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79858,"logo_path":null,"name":"Special Affects films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2014-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L for Leisure","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4}
