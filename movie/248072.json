Brian, a writer on the verge of a breakdown, is aided by Joe and an Elusive Woman as he sifts through the fragments of his persona to discover his true core. Fighting against fear and the indifference of society - aptly symbolized by the medical establishment - his quest reflects the classical mythos of Proteus and the human search for meaning in the universe.","popularity":1.052,"poster_path":"/nLEy6j5PiPXFW5VLgYPXFBztP05.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-04","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"If you could be anywhere, where would you be?","title":"Praxis","video":false,"vote_average":3.4,"vote_count":7}
