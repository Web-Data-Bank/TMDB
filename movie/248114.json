Based on Astrid Lindgren's book 'Emil of Lönneberga'. A story of a little boy, Emil, who, according to others is incredibly naughty, but actually Emil is a lot more kind hearted than all the rest. And everything he does is to help someone. But somehow it all the time turns out like a prank. His family won't agree with any pranks on themselves, so there goes Emil in his father's tool shed, where he's locked up for every prank. Includes the phrase - 'the main idea is to keep your feet warm', which has been adapted in Latvian culture, so it's already a saying.","popularity":0.942,"poster_path":"/jRT10gyxaWKmOUypLq8feJZ27fG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82801,"logo_path":"/8h6Ugz5S1DiX7kaeg19eQKXsS4q.png","name":"Rīgas kinostudija","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1985-01-04","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Naughty Emil","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":3}
