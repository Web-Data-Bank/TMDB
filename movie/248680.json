Sumerian records also mention advanced human cloning technology and the existence of an additional planet in our solar system referred to as Nibiru, which is currently unknown to modern science, and is the recorded home of our human ancestors, according to these ancient records. Eminent scientists agree that calculations tend to confirm the accuracy of the ancient Sumerian creation story. Now unmanned U.S. space probes have photographed pyramids and other strange features on the surface of Mars, suggesting this was once the site of an alien space base.\r This production appears to be a trimmed edit of the 1978 production of the same name.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qECjaJChGlSj30MWTXipahmb9b7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79656,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paradox Media","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Are We Alone in the Universe","title":"Are We Alone In the Universe?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
