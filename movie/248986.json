It is the starting point for an investigation. In this case it is an investigation into consequentiality, or at least the significance of sequentiality in the construction of meaning and concept. As such, the film encroaches on 'narrative' cinema, but in a way which treats narrativization as problematic, not transparent.\" - Malcolm Le Grice","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2ibnuvDBuMzF5FE35Z3FBzjG6oV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"After Lumière – l'Arroseur arrosé","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
