Military governor Makram Khouri tries to flush out some fugitive PLO activists by hanging the rotting, stinking carcass of a dead donkey in a village square. Israeli doctor Rami Danon forgets his animosity towards the PLO and, out of compassion, cuts the carcass down. For disobeying Khouri's orders, Danon becomes as much a fugitive as the Palestinians. While in hiding, Danon befriends Arab hermit Tuncel Kurtiz, whose adopted son is a member of the PLO.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/cW9VDnbRTKRv6fuZrMRxLSNpMTQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":101585,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dotan/Aroch Film Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"1986-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Smile of the Lamb","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":5}
