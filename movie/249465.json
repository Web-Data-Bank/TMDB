It is a lush green place near a river, containing over-sized mushrooms, living plants, and friendly woodland animals.  Shortly after their arrival in the pleasant Agapeland, Stevie and Nancy discover the Marvelous Music Machine, which Stevie explains is a \"quanamatic digilator.\" Stevie tries to make it work, but only succeeds in causing it to produce a loud noise, which shoves him back into the Music Machine's caretaker (possibly creator), The Conductor.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":19371,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bridgestone Group","origin_country":""},{"id":19372,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anthony Paul Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Music Machine","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
