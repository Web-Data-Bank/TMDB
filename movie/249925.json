In the dead of winter in the mountain valley of Missoula, Montana, Doris has just returned to the U.S. after years teaching English abroad. At the local university, she forms a small community with her class of international students. But outside she is alienated, unable to form meaningful connections. Doris explores the town, coming across clues to a recent legacy of displaced persons: an old photograph of an Indian camp, a row of Japanese graves in the local cemetery. And she is haunted by a strange encounter with a boy, who lives in a motel on the edge of town. As winter begins to thaw, she and her students must consider the complexities of adapting and belonging. What if home is no longer a place, but just an idea? Could you lose yourself completely? The next decision they make will redefine not only their lives, but their very identities.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/sVvAiJvGJ5SPBPbLjPyxgX00UdB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bella Vista","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
