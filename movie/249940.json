She hitch-hikes, pilfers a meal from a gas station, encounters strangers who could be her next ride or a passing glimpse, ambling toward some unknown destination.  At the end of her pilgrimage, Zoé reaches the English Channel; on the ferry a woman mysteriously disappears.  A new coat gives Zoé a new identity, but even in a new country she's not quite sure she's escaped herself.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/hJHkRmyk1PieiogsKWXraqLFWGV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51101,"logo_path":null,"name":"8horses","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2013-08-09","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cherry Pie","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":5}
