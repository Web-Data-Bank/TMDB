Director Basilio Martin Patino presents his story, and a large part of the film is based on his own life, through the experiences of an exiled heroine played by Charo Lopez. She has returned to Spain to look for meaning in her life, something that she never found living in Germany, not even after having a child. She is also in the process of translating the German lyric poet Friederich Holderlin (see the 1985 Halfte Des Lebens) into Spanish, focusing on his epic Hyperion. Excerpts from the translation are voiced over throughout the film. As she looks up old friends from many, many years ago, even those who have achieved worldly success are suffering from the same ennui that propelled her back home.","popularity":1.18,"poster_path":"/kih7IRz4Ctwi837FKvdvrzL9S4C.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42551,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Linterna Mágica","origin_country":""},{"id":981,"logo_path":"/pkrdO9ykplO4Zc8edikoSX5APUN.png","name":"TVE","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1985-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lost Paradise","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3}
