Based on the assertion that divine apparitions arenâ€™t what they always appear to be, Vesuvius is an interesting take on the psychopath with Catholicism smacked against the background.

Whereas Grave Torture uses darkness impeccably, Vesuvius plays with light so well.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/226ECT3mJrEiSr5nMSM2ffjqwp9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19440,"logo_path":null,"name":"The YOMYOMF Network","origin_country":""},{"id":19441,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reality Multimedia","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2012-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vesuvius","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":3}
