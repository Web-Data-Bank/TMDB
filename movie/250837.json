But it doesn't take long for their great plans to unravel, as the group's desire to see the important sights gets sidetracked by their fondness for partying and the opposite sex, and as they roll through Amsterdam, Berlin, Athens, and Bologna, they stumble into a wide variety of misadventures and meet all manner of unlikely people, from a former teacher who has come rather dramatically out of the closet to a washed-up dance-pop star.","popularity":0.651,"poster_path":"/kxdHKo31xTQWgLa07v1pn7gBIkX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Great Idea","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":2}
