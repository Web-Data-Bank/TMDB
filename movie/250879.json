What would you do, if your love one never wants to depart. No matter how you kill him. This is not just a romantic tale. It's a horrific love story in the heat of the night.  The film combined local belief of \"PI-POP\" (ผีปอบ), the flesh eating spirit in the northeastern Thailand, with modern day-domestic violence. In an old apartment, the death of 14 year old school girl suddenly destroyed everyone's life. Some people blamed themselves. Someone simply wanted more blood.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gCt9aLJK6uOCh7JiT72BPPuRj6Y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12874,"logo_path":"/apZrykxIdwQ6vmpDHirWBtqTZOK.png","name":"Phranakorn Film","origin_country":"TH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"2005-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Secret Room No. 7","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
