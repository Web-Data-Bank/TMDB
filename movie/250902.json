Image began as more than just a publisher - it was a response to years of creator mistreatment, and changed comics forever. The Image Revolution tells the story of Image Comics, from its founders' work at Marvel, through Image's early success, company difficulties during the comics market implosion, and ultimately the publisher's new generation of properties like The Walking Dead. Filled with colorful characters, the film is a clarion call to artists to take control of their destiny.","popularity":2.605,"poster_path":"/8WI5wwBg3rb4QCTnMKrOZWis6mO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15287,"logo_path":null,"name":"Respect Films","origin_country":""},{"id":15288,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sequart","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Image Revolution","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":12}
