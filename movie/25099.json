There’s a lion tamer who shares his theories on the mental processes of wild animals; a topiary gardener who has devoted a lifetime to shaping bears and giraffes out of hedges and trees; a man fascinated with hairless mole rats; and an MIT scientist who has designed complex, autonomous robots that can crawl like bugs.","popularity":1.296,"poster_path":"/p7NUwjcPeKRs74sTkwRXdO0v4o3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3906,"logo_path":"/iSK5VQnKq7ZZKI3ge9K1DySvJYm.png","name":"American Playhouse","origin_country":"US"},{"id":121372,"logo_path":null,"name":"Errol Morris Films","origin_country":""},{"id":125687,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fourth Floor Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1997-10-03","revenue":878960,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fast, Cheap & Out of Control","video":false,"vote_average":6.833,"vote_count":33}
