In a silent impulse he takes her body and plunges on the road. This man had never left his hometown, Brasília. When his wife dies, he leaves pushed by this emotional collapse, and submerges the road and it’s fortuity, searching to reconstruct his own reality. She survives in his memory. The road and its environment play an essential part in this man’s process: the landscape and the people, spontaneously. The Sun Against My Eyes follows this trip, from the countryside plateau to the fluminense hills.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qgV9KwUU5CA9h3d55T2EUGtHe3C.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2014-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sun Against My Eyes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
