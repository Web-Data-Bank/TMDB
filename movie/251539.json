Even his lawyers have zero respect for the rabidly sociopathic Davi. But Jewish defence attorney Ron Leibman is obsessed with the concept of Due Process, and has vowed that Davi will receive a scrupulously fair trial when the terrorist is extradited to America. The defence mounted by Leibman confounds and aggravates government prosecutor Sam Waterston--but he, like Leibman, remains a man of judiciary integrity.","popularity":1.757,"poster_path":"/zVidns6j5NGsijmdeZJ1KKT5o6A.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16074,"logo_path":null,"name":"Robert Papazian Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":36776,"logo_path":null,"name":"Century Group Ltd.","origin_country":""},{"id":36777,"logo_path":null,"name":"George Englund Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1988-12-30","revenue":0,"runtime":134,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Is he a prisoner of justice ... or revenge.","title":"Terrorist on Trial: The United States vs. Salim Ajami","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
