At its heart, a feisty but feminine Rosalind (Naomi Frederick), in love with the endearingly na√Øve Orlando (Jack Laskey), uses her disguise as Ganymede to counsel him playfully in the art of wooing. Distraction is provided by Dominic Rowan, a remarkably funny Touchstone, and Tim McMullan, whose sonorous tones are perfectly suited to the lugubrious wit of Jaques. Filmed in High Definition and true surround sound.","popularity":1.537,"poster_path":"/ub20VvZ8vcD22tcjBaVNqhbMSVm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2010-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":147,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shakespeare's Globe: As You Like It","video":true,"vote_average":8.667,"vote_count":3}
