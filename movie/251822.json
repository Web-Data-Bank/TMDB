The last shelter for those who hang around at night. These shadows walking silently along the streets, selling their poor body heat for a few crumpled banknotes, swallow and digested by their voracious thirst for a cheap high. Enough to forget for a while the distress of a ruined life and to dream of a more rejoicing elsewhere. Nathalie and her brother Tof struggle against this futureless world. Pierre, a shoe-repairer, troubled by Nathalie's grace will take part for a while to the life of these two children of misery.","popularity":1.75,"poster_path":"/w9CXnXn09rfHVFZ2wh3pxG3fQnG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19580,"logo_path":null,"name":"Climax Production","origin_country":""},{"id":19581,"logo_path":null,"name":"MGF","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1997-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Select Hotel","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":7}
