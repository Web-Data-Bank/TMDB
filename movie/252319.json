There is a man in a nearby kingdom, \"Divine Physician\" Chang Po-chao, whom it's said could cure his epilepsy, but the only way to bribe the head of the border guard is with a new work by painter Wei Yu-pi. He, meanwhile, wishes to be paid in jade, in fact with a specific piece, which requires a thief. But Ting Yu-yu, the best in the area, claims to be retired, though his daughter Li-ting (Cheng Pei-pei) seems enthusiastic. And for the sake of secrecy, the archivists originally sent to recruit Chang don't even know it's on behalf of the emperor!","popularity":1.304,"poster_path":"/smRqhiFIlEE7sRY5uErxcIR4eY3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25345,"logo_path":null,"name":"Central Motion Picture Corporation","origin_country":"TW"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The ultimate kung fu--only 1 fighter will live!","title":"All the King's Men","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":6}
