The great device codenamed as the “Phantom” is invented by the Global Security Corporation in order to eliminate the crime and to establish a secure global community.  But, it is not how it really is. The reverse side of the “Phantom” is to establish an absolute control over people’s minds. The Corporation aims to change the course of the history, by gaining the community of obedient “puppets”, who would never realize that their minds are being controlled.  Step by step, the “Phantom” fractures people’s lives, but nobody suspects anything, until it destroys the lives of in-love couple- Timur and Keira. She is convicted of murder, and he needs to break the law to save her. An American criminal hacker named Zach helps Timur to find the truth, and to uncover the Corporation’s conspiracy.","popularity":2.948,"poster_path":"/Amt659uWYqbLCZ23BVrbDK9T1K0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3623,"logo_path":"/v3XJT8ci1OScqcMOqd6uAExJCcV.png","name":"Kazakhfilm Studios","origin_country":"KZ"},{"id":24911,"logo_path":null,"name":"MG Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KZ","name":"Kazakhstan"}],"release_date":"2014-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Kazakh","iso_639_1":"kk","name":"қазақ"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Science has made us gods even before we are worthy of being men","title":"Hunting the Phantom","video":false,"vote_average":3.7,"vote_count":9}
