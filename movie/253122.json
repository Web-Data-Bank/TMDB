Thousands of Hollywood hopefuls lineup around the block to be selected to strike a deal with Satan himself in order to achieve the unattainable stardom they so desperately seek. The turnout yields not only dedicated actors and musicians who can't get a break, but a legion of seemingly successful people willing to sign in blood not to attain immortality or world peace - but for material things like money, houses, cars and diamonds or even lesser things like a gun you never have to re-load. Ultimately, Kai Blackwood, an aspiring rock star is chosen and embarks on a nefarious path of real-life occult practices following the instructions laid out in the ancient book 'Le Grande Grimoire' and proceeds to LITERALLY sell his soul to the Devil.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-08-27","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Warning: Do Not Try This At Home","title":"I Sold My Soul to Satan","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
