Filmed at Atlanta's Phillips Arena during their Destiny Fulfilled farewell tour, the trio pulled all the stops--short of flying over the audience--to put on a spectacular show for their fans. Opening the show with their Grammy-winning \"Say My Name,\" the group--who famously sang while running around a track as girls to build their lung strength--belted their harmonies and runs while dancing through a medley of hits including \"No, No, No,\" \"Bugaboo,\" \"Bills, Bills, Bills,\" \"Bootylicious\" and \"Jumpin' Jumpin.'\"","popularity":0.926,"poster_path":"/9tWngfbHUsVVzvDRxaTUMZ1BnVo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4375,"logo_path":"/eo8fJbkpiz9Wdsl1qDSEX4GXeZH.png","name":"Sony Music Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Destiny's Child: Live in Atlanta","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":6}
