By night, Richard indulges his own romantic fantasies with a steady stream of beautiful undergraduates.  But Richard has grown tired of the  game and is looking for something more meaningful and lasting.  So when Kate, Richard’s tanned, athletic, 25-year-old American girlfriend tells him that she is pregnant, Richard is thrilled.  He looks forward to having a family of his own,  being a father his children could be proud of, not some sex-fueled bobcat.  There is only one problem.  Richard’s not in love with Kate.  Richard is in love with Kate’s sister, Olivia. He had been in love with her ever since he first saw her.","popularity":13.791,"poster_path":"/2rW0u6qDw8kBRS4Ak3Wx1uauYaq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":30131,"logo_path":null,"name":"Southpaw Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":597,"logo_path":null,"name":"Irish Dreamtime","origin_country":""},{"id":24277,"logo_path":"/mRSBVNNL2lZvJKVGjlxeUQVRc6X.png","name":"PalmStar Media","origin_country":"US"},{"id":76992,"logo_path":"/mw3j3P8SUQJKLSJQrLKuSDO9Xr6.png","name":"Saban Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":1632,"logo_path":"/cisLn1YAUuptXVBa0xjq7ST9cH0.png","name":"Lionsgate","origin_country":"US"},{"id":33768,"logo_path":"/f8TDXTNoj4G4eRCKlUpG3KYQj9I.png","name":"The Solution","origin_country":"US"},{"id":45358,"logo_path":null,"name":"Merced Media Partners","origin_country":""},{"id":11030,"logo_path":null,"name":"Envision Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":57944,"logo_path":null,"name":"SPD Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-07-16","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Every good love story has three sides.","title":"Some Kind of Beautiful","video":false,"vote_average":5.622,"vote_count":521}
