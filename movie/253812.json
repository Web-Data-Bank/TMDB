Pag-itim ng Tagak","overview":"\"Pag-puti ng Uwak, Pag-itim ng Tagak\" is a pulsating love story that recaptures the nostalgic fifties, the exciting era of mass hysteria, and the golden years of the rock and roll fever inflicted by screaming, wiggling hip-shaking foreign pop idols dominated by Elvis Presley, Bill Haley, Little Richard, Pat Boone, Doris Day and the Platters. It is more than a love story. It is also a commentary - a satire rich with humor injected into a moral, psychological, sociological, and cultural aspect, outlook, and values of the said bygone era. It is a poignant rich-girl-meets poor boy love story of Julie Monserat and Candido Ventura - two love-struck starry eyed youths who fought for their right to love each other, here is a story that touches social conflict - the perennial clashes and discrimination between the rich and the poor.","popularity":0.623,"poster_path":"/5tNXyF2u6FOsqbOjJ4aeKkA2p97.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19787,"logo_path":null,"name":"VS Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"1978-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When the Crow Turns White, When the Heron Turns Black","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
