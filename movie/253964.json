The town gave way to a national park not long after the film was shot, making this a unique record of a long-gone community.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1926-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Virginian Types: Blue Ridge Mountaineers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
