Miller's first narrative creation is like nothing you have seen before. Uso Justo (roughly translated: 'Fair Use') is a complete restructuring of an obscure 1959 Mexican film. As the experimental filmmaker pulls the strings on the residents of this fictional town, the technique proves to be existential and hilarious, intelligent and stupid. All the while, the citizens try to keep up with the filmmaker's absurd sensibilities and crazy antics. Their actions all end in vain with hilarious consequences.","popularity":1.341,"poster_path":"/8DHVtGPo6wP9eXhKZAtWYnlBh3S.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Uso Justo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
