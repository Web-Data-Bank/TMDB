At Won Wron, Case Worker Matt Perry has established a unique program to rehabilitate broken men through giving them the responsibility for the rehabilitation of injured raptors - beautiful, fearsome proud eagles, falcons and owls. Against all odds, Matt takes on Viktor as his number one test case, introducing him to Yasmine, the majestic wedge tailed eagle with a 2 metre wingspan. If these two can tame each other, anything is possible.","popularity":2.522,"poster_path":"/caJcZItUQJslv15jbha71Q7xHaf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94202,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pointblank Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":7584,"logo_path":"/eGkfvvyf4fJTvBUR1xt1669IPA3.png","name":"Screen Australia","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":11840,"logo_path":"/8oyCRYf6ezxB5h8HJIPVG8JjzgL.png","name":"Film Victoria","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2014-04-03","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Healing","video":false,"vote_average":6.324,"vote_count":17}
