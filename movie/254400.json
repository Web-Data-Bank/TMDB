Soap star John Ingle is the confused head of the hospital.","popularity":1.165,"poster_path":"/V9DhwaRRq6iu7IXKf6Iwq5fguA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"McBride: The Doctor is Out...Really Out","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
