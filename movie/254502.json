The doctor just replies that the problem can be solved by R20. R20 is played fabulously by Dimitris Starovas. He is a former psychologist (now operating his father's import export meat business) that uses company trucks as moving brothels. R20 actually stands for: \"Russian 20 years old\" which eventually means that Lakis Lazopoulos has to cheat on his wife to solve his problem.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8vIdjvnpI2AtbMPqwlEZyonEeJi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2004-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"You can do it again!","title":"R20","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":6}
