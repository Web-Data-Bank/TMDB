Well, Richard Bishop has decided he would like a piece of the action.  This film is a diabolical experiment in hypnotic mind control—a phantasmagoric presentation of demonic and divine imagery, meticulously assembled and designed to put the viewer into an altered state of darkened awareness.  If you ever wanted to go to hell and back, this film will get you halfway there. Some viewers may find the imagery used in this film to be disturbing, but that’s the idea. Contains some strong sexual content (as all true religion should). Not for the weak-minded, faint of heart, or those suffering from occasional seizures.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-02-26","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"God Damn Religion","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
