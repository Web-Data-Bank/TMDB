A key figure of contemporary jazz, Diana Krall bewitches with her rounded contralto timbre and her piano rambles, for which she’s been awarded several Grammies. In her most recent album, Glad Rag Doll (2012), Diana mischievously extracts the charm from ’20s standards and polishes them up as though they had just been invented yesterday. Marvellous vaudeville, skillfully produced by guitarist T-Bone Burnett and accompanied by Marc Ribot, among others.
