Jarre's team had developed giant projections to be displayed on the faces of the Great Pyramids, however a heavy cloud of fog made the pyramids almost invisible, so most of the projections were discarded. Parts of the concert were broadcast live on TV stations around the world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ozGh6KukvoKFWtLpRMWf5isrnvy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jean Michel Jarre at the Pyramids","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
