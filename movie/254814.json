During the summer months, the horses live a wild existence, grazing in the highlands and raising their young. Each fall, they are rounded up by local farmers and directed across the stunning landscape. The horse holds a precious place in Icelandic culture, art and tradition; for over 1,000 years Icelandic law has prohibited the importation of horses onto the island.","popularity":0.624,"poster_path":"/jGZMQ1YmVx075d94azsMCGd1baM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Herd in Iceland","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
