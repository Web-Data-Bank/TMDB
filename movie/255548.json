The film is composed of long silences in which the hermit executes his daily chores, such as cooking and cleaning, and of images that transcend his territory. Towards the end we discover that silence is commonplace in the hermit’s life, the normal state in which time passes. Speech is the state of exception.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3JHkfXR2iTpUnJbjZrEwtHYoqyu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125951,"logo_path":null,"name":"Marimbondo","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2004-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Soul of the Bone","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":4}
