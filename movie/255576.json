His overly astute hearing drives him into the woods and away from the cacophony of the town's hustle and bustle. Once in the woods, he meets a kindly old hermit who teaches him how to play the violin he made. After the old man dies, the violin ends up at a pawn shop, and each night the boy sneaks in to play it in secret. It is this haunting, nightly music that sets the town on edge -- people think an evil spirit is on the loose.","popularity":0.685,"poster_path":"/1UkfkZ5xb6MQ8T7oCJbD99ChYD3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18526,"logo_path":null,"name":"Producciones Yanco","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"1961-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yanco","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":11}
