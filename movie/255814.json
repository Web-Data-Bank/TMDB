Young musicians without work chase away their depression with drugs and dreams of the West. Marius grabs his accordion and plays some gypsy blues to charm the moneylenders who demand their due, to seduce a beautiful chick or maybe even attract Johnny Depp who, it seems, promised to be godfather to his youngest child. Won, stolen, borrowed or exchanged, money is the only way to thwart the fate that dogs this small gypsy community. Clejani is a chasm at the end of a road. Some are willing to do anything to get away.","popularity":0.622,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-07-20","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Clejani, povesti, histoires, stories...","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
