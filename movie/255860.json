Rose is young, beautiful, and spoiled - in a word, irresistible. Disappointed in love, she moves to Paris. When Charles dies suddenly, she rushes back to Hong Kong to take over the family estate. Fate intervenes when she meets Ka-ming (also played by Chow Yun-fat), who is the exact image of her late brother. The two fall in love, but their romance is in the hands of a not always benevolent fate.","popularity":1.022,"poster_path":"/h4KQAS1u9tybbExSUxd63LxsSv8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78165,"logo_path":null,"name":"Far-Sun Film Company","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1986-02-21","revenue":1026192,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rose","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":3}
