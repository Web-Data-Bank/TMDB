He sails out in a small boat to collect his freight if there is enough mist to make his illegal mission possible. One day he reluctantly accepts a much larger cargo. In the crate he finds a wounded and drugged woman.  Todor decides not to deliver the freight and takes the woman home with him. He takes a chest full of stones to his client and it soon becomes apparent that he has got himself into big trouble with this manoeuvre. Todor takes care of the woman, who slowly but surely overcomes her fear of him. By the time he manages to get her a passport, an unbreakable bond has silently grown between them and he asks her to go away with him. Fate decides otherwise.","popularity":0.622,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":730,"logo_path":null,"name":"Flying Moon Filmproduktion GmbH","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":57617,"logo_path":null,"name":"Unlimited","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":101948,"logo_path":null,"name":"Revolver","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2007-01-18","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"At the End of the Sea","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1}
