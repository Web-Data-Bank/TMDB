Hexagonal refractions and spectral rays puncture alluded-to landscapes - rivers, skies, prairies, trees, mountains. Graphic (yet spatially free-floating) imagery slices intently wrought rhythms of light and dark color fields, producing afterimages. The film concludes with bright, almost-discernible window shapes, hinting at an opening to a different realm.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/y0mbVPrdyye8h8QGvmuhcFh6Eej.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Crossing","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
