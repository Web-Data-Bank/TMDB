The man, who is young, handsome, and well-dressed, remains mute as Julitte nurses him back to health. Jean, meanwhile, who is inexplicably estranged from Julitte and an outsider to townspeople, continues his hunt for pirate treasure, rumored to be hidden in a cave by the sea. The treasure is his ticket out of Acadia. As loneliness and Eros draw Julitte and the mysterious Jérôme together, something's got to give.","popularity":0.62,"poster_path":"/ld0oWm0I3V5C2gjhR1za7kMOmo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4172,"logo_path":"/vb2gE5Ao9wIfj3XlY8CwwwbnAlh.png","name":"CinéGroupe","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":3559,"logo_path":null,"name":"Citadel Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1994-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jerome's Secret","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
