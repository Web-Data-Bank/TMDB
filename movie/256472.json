Why do we cheat? Why is monogamy so important to a relationship and why does infidelity cause so much grief?  These are some of the questions acclaimed documentary filmmaker Dhruv Dhawan confronts in his next feature length documentary which explores why human beings evolved cultures of marriage and monogamy that are rife with infidelity.  As he attends various lavish weddings occurring within his family, Dhruv is pestered to follow suit but is haunted by his family’s history of infidelity, as well as his own and embarks on a personal quest to discover the origins of marriage, the reasons for monogamy and the pain of infidelity as he tries to mediate an open relationship with the woman he loves.  Dhruv’s search takes us on a journey into the biology of sex, the history of patriarchy and the politics of monogamy told through the lives of scientists, swingers, adulterers and Dhruv’s own family.","popularity":1.083,"poster_path":"/2AhmHjjBdSq1fr1IgkHyGgg2HFq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20253,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Real","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AE","name":"United Arab Emirates"}],"release_date":"2014-12-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Breaking the silence on monogamy","title":"Why Knot","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":3}
