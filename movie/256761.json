The tunnels terminated in what was one of the greatest architectural achievements of its time, Pennsylvania Station. Penn Station covered nearly eight acres, extended two city blocks, and housed one of the largest public spaces in the world. But just 53 years after the stationâ€™s opening, the monumental building that was supposed to last forever, to herald and represent the American Empire, was slated to be destroyed.","popularity":1.151,"poster_path":"/afHIEEZUhrHChnzyLkgWfc3KmvX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Rise & Fall of Penn Station","video":false,"vote_average":9.5,"vote_count":2}
