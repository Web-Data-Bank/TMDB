Abandoned by his family on a trip to Tokyo with only a few notes in his pocket, he thinks he has found his guardian angel when he bumps into a former classmate, Hoi (Chapman To). But Hoi is no angel at all. He is just a grifter on the run from yakuza loan sharks. When Yan (Yang Kuei-mei), the owner of an escort service, is convinced the ingenuous Jun will mark a perfect gigolo, Hoi decides to transform his pal into Tokyo's most sought-after Lothario in order to eke out a living and to pay his debts.","popularity":0.968,"poster_path":"/oXi5XtJRz9m6VWK6kQcCoMFjIFA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6377,"logo_path":null,"name":"Media Asia Films Ltd.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2005-12-29","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moonlight in Tokyo","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":3}
