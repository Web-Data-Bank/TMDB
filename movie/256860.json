From his blood and spit struggles on the mean streets to his rise to the top of the hip-hop world to this large man's losing war with his 700-pound bulk. This unique, frightening, ugly, painful, haunting, and occasionally, beautiful story is a high-steppin' razor that slashes into the heart, bones and belly of one of hip-hop's greatest players, offering unquestionably the most intimate look ever inside the hard world of hip-hop and into the ravaged yet hopeful life of one of its most popular and legendary figures.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gioOAiEErfxpDVVqP3CzWncBJXA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88703,"logo_path":null,"name":"Miranda Movies","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Big Pun: Still Not a Player","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
