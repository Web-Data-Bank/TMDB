Folks in the know wondered how could a first-time event in rural Tennessee sell out all 70,000 of its tickets in a matter of days, with no advertising except email and word of mouth. And why would anyone, with the riots of Woodstock '99 a not-too-distant memory, even attempt such an event. The answer is that Bonnaroo, staged on a green expanse of Tennessee farmland June 21-23 2002, is the apotheosis of a movement that has quietly gained momentum for over a decade, existing as a parallel music universe.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Live from Bonnaroo Music Festival 2002","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
