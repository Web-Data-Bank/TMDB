As in classic childhood stories, we witness the fusion of magic, tragedy, young love, and the trials of adolescence woven into a powerful tale of redemption. With subtle notes of man’s responsibility to nature, in a world where nature is turning against us, The Desert Fish ultimately reveals how much a child will sacrifice for a chance at happiness, and how much we will have to sacrifice for our future.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Desert Fish","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
