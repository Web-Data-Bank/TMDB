Besides being a truly gifted comic, Caesar benefited from having some brilliant supporting players, including Carl Reiner, Imogene Coca, and Nanette Fabray. Some of his illustrious writers, including Neil Simon, Woody Allen, and Mel Brooks, appear in interviews setting up the sketches. The sketches themselves include some all-time classics such as Caesar and company playing the figurines populating a medieval town clock (a brilliant bit partly written by Neil Simon and his brother, Danny, who reminisce after the sketch).","popularity":1.547,"poster_path":"/pmGPBs3mtdYqN2qPc8fWJxtANUl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4419,"logo_path":null,"name":"Creative Light Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Classic Comedy from Your Show of Shows and Caesar's Hour","title":"The Sid Caesar Collection: The Magic of Live TV","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
