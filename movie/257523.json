The film does not tell a story, but is made up of various scenes put together as a collage with scenes set in different locations. The futility of human activity and the search for love make up the film's central theme set against the strains of a Silician funeral march. Filmed on location in Wuppertal, Germany, between October 1987 and April 1989.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6feZo8gmtTkuICBX6o6M6xKLVhH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":181,"logo_path":"/zhQ77XOviCBuXd74IurqqjgLNe0.png","name":"Channel Four Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":16366,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Sept Cin√©ma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1990-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Complaint of an Empress","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3}
