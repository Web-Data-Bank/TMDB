Led by his desperation, he literally escapes into an American television sitcom in order to forget about his Cuban past. Not knowing what to do, his family prays to the Virgin Mary to ask for help. When the cultures clash, Robertico has to decide whether he is strong enough to withstand his own self-hatred, and learn not only self-esteem, but how to embrace his Cuban roots.","popularity":0.665,"poster_path":"/dSP3hoTlZ2FfX5vLPngCTCW4jtK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Things I Forgot to Remember","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
