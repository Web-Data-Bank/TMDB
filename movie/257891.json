Rosa is an artist in her early forties who is recently divorced and looking for a new relationship. Unfortunately, few immediate prospects are on the horizon, and Rosa spends much of her free time commiserating with her close friend Jaime, a gay actor her own age. After consulting Andronica, a fortune teller, Rosa is told that relationships with three different men are on the horizon for her, and soon she finds herself falling for Gustavo, an architect from Argentina. While in Spain, Gustavo is staying at a hotel run by Greta, who is the unwitting center of a web of romantic entanglements; her daughter, is involved with Juan, a delivery boy for a pizza parlor who also has his eye on Rosa, while Greta's ex-husband (Bob Wilson) is also hoping to win Rosa's heart, in his case through poetry.","popularity":0.841,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sagitario","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
