He has connected his inmates into a group mind where they share each other's psychoses, dreams and sexuality with all the scary and titillating implications imaginable! Like his highly acclaimed cult classic MASSACRE AT CENTRAL HIGH, director Rene Daalders provocative excursion into sci fi-horror filmmaking looks at first glance like a classic grindhouse movie, but it is up to much more. In addition to its operatic mayhem, HYSTERIA is a mind-expanding reflection on individual vs. group consciousness, power, control, and freedom.","popularity":2.166,"poster_path":"/6Hq3PTAOJ42FVbDkrG3S3PNWlLz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3322,"logo_path":null,"name":"August Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1997-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Madness is a State of Mind","title":"Hysteria","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":6}
