Ramona lives in the suburbs of Buenos Aires. Every day she travels four hours and a half to reach her job and to get back home. She divides her working time between two upper middle-class homes where she receives the name of Réimon, a sound that evokes the English language, a Buenos Aires upper class snobbish custom.  It´s fiction and it´s not. It´s also a film about the labour conditions of a worker, about the time this worker uses for working and the efforts that implies working. It´s also about the absurdity of cleaning someone else´s house, the absurdity of modern life and the differences between social classes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bCJCHRQSZIvkAzCx0UlKS4qlJvE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135551,"logo_path":null,"name":"Compañia Amateur","origin_country":""},{"id":18485,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rohfilm","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":11999,"logo_path":"/50K9W66YeWjOalNcjWddPcSgIYO.png","name":"Universidad del Cine","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2015-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Réimon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
