The band played an explosive \"Scheme\" to start, followed immediately by the classic \"Artifact\" track \"Vibyl\". A rowdy \"Instantly\" had the crowd worked into a frenzy and a beautiful version of \"Circus\" followed. The old favorites kept coming with \"Warrior\", \"Arigato\" and \"Blu Mood\", which features a masterful guitar riff nailed by Hunter Brown. To kick off the second set, the band performed a dance-inducing version of \"Kabuki\". Set 2 continued the trend of STS9's most recent tour theme that blend the old with the new. Established favorites \"F.Word\" and \"One A Day\" were played amidst \"20-12\" and \"March\". During Rent, David Phipps' now famous haunting synthesizer riff had Athens fans waving their arms in unison. A powerful encore started with the funky \"Wika Chikana\". The band closed with \"Kamuy\", a song featuring Zach Velmer and Jeffree Lerner dueling on drums, showcasing the heartbeat of STS9.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"STS9: 2013.03.22 - Georgia Theatre, Athens, GA","video":true,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
