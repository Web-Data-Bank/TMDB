She does not know who her father is and she is determined to find him, but her mother does not approve it. The hostility of winter in such a harsh place turns this desire into a real threat: freezing in the middle of nowhere. Going behind the backs of the school authorities and the girl's mother, her teacher decides to help her. They set off on this quest for truth, but it is not going to be an easy journey... Their only clue is a small, rusty plate.","popularity":0.941,"poster_path":"/br1ogbHAthia4NwNz1sXABuErpY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26593,"logo_path":null,"name":"Metaluna Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":70085,"logo_path":null,"name":"Salta la Liebre","origin_country":""},{"id":64499,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tarea Fina","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2014-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Natural Sciences","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":11}
