Drugstores are being raided by junkies and gangs are nervous, fighting each others: the 'Viets', the 'Blackies', the 'Arabs', the neo-nazis 'Justiciers' and some mean gays.  Vincent (Daniel Auteuil) is the good cop coming from Marseilles where he was a gangster. He's a soft method guy but also kicks assses hard and throw lethal dialog lines when needed. With the precious help of 'l'Arbalète'* (Marisa Berenson**), a tox' prostitute ex-member of Vincent's former gang, he will try to put order in that mess. There's also a violent and racist cop (Marcel Bozzuffi), Algeria veteran with hard methods, whose role could be more than to protect and to serve.","popularity":0.732,"poster_path":"/A4gHWG4NEW8zDopFqub1UM4miJc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":62118,"logo_path":null,"name":"Candice Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":7800,"logo_path":null,"name":"Compagnie Commerciale Française Cinématographique (CCFC)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1984-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Syringe","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2}
