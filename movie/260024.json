Cockle) and his socially superior love, Sai-Yu (Theresa Seth).  Both live in the village of Samarang in the Indian Ocean.  Because Sai-Yu is the daughter of a chief and Ahmang is but a poor fisherman, he needs to increase his wealth before asking for her hand.  Thus he accepts the perilous offer of the wily Chang-Fu, who seeks pearl divers.  Ahmang must brave the treacherous waters of the Forbidden Lagoon of Sakai, home to bloodthirsty cannibals, killer sharks, and a monstrous grasping octopus.  Sai-Yu and Ahmang’s younger brother Ko-Hai come along for kicks, too.  Ahmang finds his pearl, but he and Sai-Yu are stranded on the island, where they befriend a local orangutan.  When they return to the boat, a shark kills Ko-Hai, and Ahmang must get revenge.","popularity":1.051,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":17456,"logo_path":null,"name":"B.F.
