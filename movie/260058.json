She's an actress with (clearly) a lot of talent, but she's maybe a bit naive.  After some bumps on the road to stardom, she meets college boy Tim, who casts her as the lead in his student film.  But Melody's desire for instant fame clashes with Tim's unwillingness to sell out and make biker flicks.","popularity":1.09,"poster_path":"/9fKbDMrpt0XFWY1BHCMh6OKHFG7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Miss Melody Jones","video":false,"vote_average":4.4,"vote_count":5}
