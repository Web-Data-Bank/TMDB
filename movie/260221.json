That parallel physical surface and his artisanal production of it might link all of O'Neill's work across media and position it as well toward the graphic-the flattening contour line of the cut out-and to collage, both in its cut and its combination as its dominant term.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Let's Make a Sandwich","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
