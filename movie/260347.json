Nami is certainly no great action heroine, and the plot at times makes little sense, climaxing with a coincidence more ridiculous than any Shakespeare ever used. For complicated reasons, Nami uses her medical knowledge to break into a women's prison as staff physician. There, as in the previous movie, the convicts wind up naked awfully frequently.","popularity":0.733,"poster_path":"/ArQ9bDKKC3T6IASdoaG7LLzteu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42614,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vision Sugimoto","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1998-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Scorpion: Double Venom 2","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":3}
