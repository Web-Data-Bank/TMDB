His girlfriend has left to work in Qatar, allowing the young man to fully thrust himself into his work as a “companion” to elderly European women who spend their vacations at local resort hotels. Danish filmmaker Emil Langballe records in detail what appears to be a budding love affair between Juma and a middle-aged British woman. The documentary turns out to be a real-life version of Ulrich Seidl’s feature Paradise: Love, investigating local female sex tourism based on a false sense of romance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swahili","iso_639_1":"sw","name":"Kiswahili"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beach Boy","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
