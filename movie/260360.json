The protagonist is a 19-year-old musical genius Joachim (modeled probably after F. Schubert or R. Schumann). A creator inhabiting the borderline between reality and madness. . . or perhaps genius? A man who steers his fate or perhaps merely follows the glamor and darkness of women (such as Clara Wieck, Schumann's wife; Mozart's Constance; or mysterious Rosamund) encountered along the way. Music of the great Romantics provides the backdrop for the story: Mozart's Quintet in A-major, Schubert's Arpeggione Sonata, and Schumann's eponymous Märchenbilder.","popularity":0.621,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fairy Tale Images","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
