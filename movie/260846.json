The two decide to form a band and put together an unlikely crew that consists of the school bully, an ex-punk-turned-barista, and a former-childstar-turned-band-manager. The film follows their misadventures as they face satanic S&M bands, samurai swindlers, narcissistic rockstars, the pretentious Philippine art community and the freakiest music video auteur ever.","popularity":1.379,"poster_path":"/cToA69glDcCsg0rQKGOtANpKfy2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":58596,"logo_path":"/kclHw3nOM1uD4W3eqUe76qHp3w2.png","name":"Reality Entertainment","origin_country":"PH"},{"id":52399,"logo_path":null,"name":"Furball Inc.","origin_country":"PH"},{"id":58597,"logo_path":null,"name":"Post Manila","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2011-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rakenrol","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
