Disappearance has another meaning in Sanchezâ€™s native Mindanao, where a decades-old conflict between the government and secessionists fighting for an Islamic state has made the region infamous for its kidnappings. Sanchez took inspiration from an incident in which a friend living abroad visited an exhibition, and found a photo of him labeled as one of the disappeared. Jungle Love is permeated with this sense of the uncanny, as narratives and identities fracture and fuse into one another in the reckless, lonely places people go to escape themselves.","popularity":1.128,"poster_path":"/1NTZXxVD140ZOkjaiBVT35jVqbM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81709,"logo_path":null,"name":"Salida Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":19781,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinema One Originals","origin_country":"PH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2012-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jungle Love","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
