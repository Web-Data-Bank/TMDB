Partially filmed live at Germany's Wacken Open Air Festival in 1998, LIVE & CLIPS captures a historic performance (the concert marked their return to the stage after a near breakup) that ranks with their best. In addition to their incredibly loud and immensely energetic performance, six music videos, spanning from 1992's \"Left To Rot\" to 1997's \"The Final Chapter,\" are included.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hLh8gqLVnKg5xAwJQhOrgTcmjVH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5796,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nuclear Blast","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hypocrisy - Live & Clips","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
