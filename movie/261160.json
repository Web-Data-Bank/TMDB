Using archival material and the accounts of those who  shared with her the necessity to respond, through their creations and activities, to  contemporary history's challenges, the film tries to reflect the movement of a thought  that dissolves the distance between prose and poetry, between personal and collective  life. It depicts a network of people united in their refusal to accept the compromises required  in our times, who reveal with their work the possibility of another reality","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2013-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Genevieve Clancy, Instants Of Life","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
