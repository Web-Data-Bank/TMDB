Filmmaker Mason Booker travels across the country and into Gen Con's final year in Milwaukee to find out who the people are behind the games, and what about role-playing has transformed it from a pastime into a complete subculture. By including original animation and interviews with Gary Gygax, Chris Clark, Tony D and Brom, Life with the Dicebag overviews what role-playing is all about yet it still stays close to the heart of the industry: the devotion of its loyal fans.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life with the Dice Bag","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
