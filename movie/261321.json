The 4 Major Rivers Project was a mega-sized national project by the LEE Myungbaek Administration to “renovate” the 4 major rivers in Korea to construct the Korean Peninsula Great Canal. The project constructs 16 dams in the rivers and expropriates farming lands and riverbeds to build bicycle roads and parks. The Paldang “Dumulmeori” organic farming area known as the hub of Korean organic farming was to be included as part of the 4 Rivers Project.
