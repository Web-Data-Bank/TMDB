The interviews are the seedbed from which Fast has pulled themes of remote warfare and the psychological effects of it on the Drone pilot, suggesting the implications of these things on current culture at large. Fastâ€™s film sutures together reality and fiction and deflects any pat or partisan readings.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u0wDNsIpNeRCEiKIszTScea9Iiz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-03","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"5,000 Feet Is the Best","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
