A middle-class family's home is no match for the monsoons, while another clan's morality is compromised when famine strikes. Young boys smuggle rice, and politicians pity the poor while living in the lap of luxury.","popularity":1.764,"poster_path":"/kYB5d8NP5X0RsPHdLLLbl3KMWU0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12736,"logo_path":null,"name":"D.S.
