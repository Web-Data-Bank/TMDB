Werner Pirchner","overview":"He's known as \"Tyrol's Zappa\" and a \"real anarchist.\" Whether folk music, jazz or what's known as serious music, Werner \"Preisegott\" Pirchner has in a creative way greatly expanded upon the limited acoustic range of his homeland, enriching it with some unfamiliar sounds from around the globe.
