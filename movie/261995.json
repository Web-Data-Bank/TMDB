The other slips into boy's clothes to stand her ground. Handsome hotelier James Sander is idolized by pretty girls and earns a lot of money on the side. But the girls are a thorn in the side of his tax consultant Hilde. She has fallen in love with the attractive bachelor and has worked out a perfect plan to win James' heart. Mike's band has also arrived at his hotel. Sweet Bibi slips there into the role of her sick brother, trying to keep the secret of her womanhood and stand her ground as a drummer. Her game of hide-and-seek is in vain - because Mike is not the only one who has his eye on her. The turbulence in the hotel reaches its climax when hotel servant Pankraz smells a crime in James Bond style and stages the total confusion.","popularity":0.696,"poster_path":"/3N92iVoDPC6dbjh6Y0IErjlHRTW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1776,"logo_path":null,"name":"Neue Delta Filmproduktion","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1966-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Happy-End am Wolfgangsee","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2}
