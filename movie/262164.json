After hiring a sketchy limousine service, a rag-tag bunch of hard partiers embark on their New Year's tradition – running naked into the Gulf of Mexico – only to find themselves 24 hours later kidnapped, stripped, stranded, and left for dead.  Combining narration of the actual participants with feature-length re-creation, filmmakers Gideon C. Kennedy and Marcus Rosentrater take you on a hilarious ride about getting lost, getting found and getting hammered.","popularity":1.218,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The true tale of ten friends surviving their wildest night in the greatest bar story ever told","title":"Limo Ride","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":1}
