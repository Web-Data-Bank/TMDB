We've been here before, but without the hindsight: a camera cruise along a hustler's meat-rack, kitchen-talk over cold canned spaghetti, Taylor Mead grimacing in a spastic dance, the silent stud a sullenly passive observer. Mitchell's ear for campy native wit and eye for figures in a loft-scape happily keep at bay the otherwise contagious NY ennui.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/9vljw6Ok3CrK2jwrh1a8W1Eb3Fh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Underground U.S.A.","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":4}
