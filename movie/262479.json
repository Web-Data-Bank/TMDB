With this newly restored print there is also a possibility to discover the relationship between Rousseau's art of filming and Jan Vermeer's famous painting. As Prosper Hillairet wrote in 1988, four years after Rousseau had finished Jeune femme ... (for the first time as we know today): «Without adopting the usual systematic spirit and form of cinéma structurel, Rousseau presents us with simple images and leaves it at that. Keeps the image in hand. A minimalist and ascetic expression of cinema: a shot that lasts.»","popularity":0.822,"poster_path":"/ks2os4pR3zENnXTcRDC7PwPB03k.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":99721,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rousseau Film Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jeune femme à sa fenêtre lisant une lettre","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
