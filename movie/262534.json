Directed by William Summers, the result is a silent classic. Unlike the famous 1916 documentary The Battle of the Somme, the Ypres footage is entirely ”faked” and the film shares some of Somme‘s propagandist approach. Regardless, the film is no less fascinating as an artistic endeavour of its time and it features some stunning images. A degree of authenticity is provided by real soldiers taking part and by the filming having taken place in the actual Ypres trenches.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6MU0nxSfih9frFpHeQUq7I6n6ct.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28184,"logo_path":null,"name":"BIF","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1925-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Story of the Immortal Salient","title":"Ypres","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
