Using a mix of fiction and documentary this extraordinary film is a searing record of personal memory, political repression and the will to survive. Interviews with eight women who were political prisoners during the military dictatorship are framed by the fantasies and imaginings of an anonymous character, portrayed by actress Irene Ravache.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/mXfLm8yQfjytKmgDkzoXGdCx43H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8542,"logo_path":"/3vpz4f0p59nGYb5kCExTD68DBfk.png","name":"Taiga Filmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"1989-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"PortuguÃªs"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How Nice to See You Alive","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":8}
