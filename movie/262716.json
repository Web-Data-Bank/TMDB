Pop songs tumble out of the jukebox, there is football on the TV, and the eight men lark around, pint glasses in hand. But their blokish fun is balanced on a knife-edge of tension, for beneath the mateyness lurks a disturbing undercurrent of paranoia and insecurity, where weakness is brutally exploited and violence covers up vulnerability.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lADQRwxCrBO9h9oKmRnciHGowDv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38242,"logo_path":null,"name":"RM Arts","origin_country":""},{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":90660,"logo_path":null,"name":"DV8 Filmproduction","origin_country":""},{"id":81569,"logo_path":null,"name":"DV8 Physical Theatre","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Enter Achilles","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
