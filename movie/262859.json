Russian film collective Gogol’s Wives follow each step of the feminist punk band’s battle against Putin including their first disruptive performances on a trolley bus, shooting a video about transparent elections, a controversial performance in a Red Square cathedral, and footage shot in a jail cell. Support comes from many corners including Madonna who painted the words \"Pussy Riot\" on her back and wore a balaclava during her Moscow show. The documentary portrays the grim state of present-day Russia, a country starkly divided between conservatism and anarchy. Pussy Riot believes that art has to be free and they're willing to take it to extremes. \"Pussycat made a mess in the house,\" they say, and the house is Russia. The filmmakers do not seek to moralize, they simply edit events and leave viewers to draw their own conclusions.","popularity":0.874,"poster_path":"/vLWn0RHzOQy94bPfwSWD9zYlICb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21453,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gogol's Wives","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2013-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Shocking and visceral profile of Pussy Riot and their protests.","title":"Pussy Versus Putin","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
