She suffers from a lingering illness. He helps her find her peace. Left alone, he escapes reality and starts to wander. DRIFT explores his quest for salvation on a mythical journey through a barren Romanian wasteland. Fighting his memories, the drifting man chooses not to speak and to loose himself in an animal-like and primitive existence. His simple but painful rituals echo an ancient culture long forgotten. As the past reveals itself, insanity sets in. Slowly, he disappears as well.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2014-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Drift","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
