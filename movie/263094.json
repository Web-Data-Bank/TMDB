Laura Adler is a big star of one of these troupes. She is attractive, middle-aged and quite content to spend her days performing obscure theater in her backwater town. One day, however, she learns that she is being considered for a part in a major U.S. film, and, while she is absorbing that news, she has an affair with a young man. Later, when she learns that she has terminal cancer, she decides to spend her remaining days onstage with her theatrical friends and family.","popularity":0.824,"poster_path":"/uCDXWOH4uvA8GguWWkDwRpRJzZw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"1990-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Love of Laura Adler","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
