As the title suggests that the movie is about a female (Rekha) who is a liar, and it is this female who shows how much lying can be a worthy quality. Nice movie with some good comedy. As in all Hrishikesh Mukherjee, the setting is a simple middle class family with ordinary existence. It is totally wonderful to see how Hrishikesh Mukherjee finds stories amongst all of us. Truly a mastermind.","popularity":1.073,"poster_path":"/55m13nf44KO7pVSt7Aqy8CJL3d.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1985-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jhoothi","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2}
