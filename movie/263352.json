On his arrival, he is greeted with the words Herzlich Willkommen, or \"cordial, heartfelt welcome.\" However, once he finds employment, what he experiences is anything but a cordial welcome at his new job, where he is a teacher/counselor for \"wayward children\" located in a former castle. The institution is headed by a former Nazi who runs it with the help of the more criminal, bullying boys. Despite these obstacles, Friedrich manages to establish a rapport with a boy who wants to go \"straight,\" and also begins to have an affair with an attractive female teacher at the school.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1990-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Herzlich willkommen","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
