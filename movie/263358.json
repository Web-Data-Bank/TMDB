The anecdotal nature of the subject matter compels Akerman to fragment her narrative, rather than offer it in one, uninterrupted continuum. Still, another Akerman trademark -- permitting the \"drama\" to emanate from the actors rather than the situations -- is very much in evidence. This informal history of Jewish life over the past 100 years is related in a series of eyewitness accounts, re-created by a group of largely unknown actors. Also known as American Stories, the Belgian/French Histoires d'Amérique began building an audience when it was shown at the Berlin Film Festival.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6MEny1o9MqcC8KCHbs3isc3jdOI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123540,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mallia Films","origin_country":""},{"id":10645,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paradise Films","origin_country":""},{"id":792,"logo_path":"/cRhBQP1FFNugNxKkO1pUgeD2Rkr.png","name":"RTBF","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":16366,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Sept Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1989-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Yiddish","iso_639_1":"yi","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"American Stories","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":5}
