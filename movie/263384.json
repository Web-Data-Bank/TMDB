After Santiago and his family arrive at his grandfather's farm, the elderly gentleman dies but not before telling his grandson a secret. On the one hand, Santiago is the heir to his grandfather's farm, and on the other, he may just have a special relationship to Teo (Alvaro de Luna), his grandfather's foreman. The little boy has a few playmates in his cousins who live on the farm with their parents, and he follows his idol Teo around with a child's admiration for his strength and unique personality. But when tragedy steps into the picture, Santiago's faith in Teo is put to the test.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Teo the Redhead","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":1}
