Pedro has disappeared at a time of upheaval, after a military junta takes over Argentina in 1976, killing thousands of leftists and dissidents. Unlike many others, Ramon's father has political ties that matter, but that may not change Pedro's fate, which could be death -- or like some who have been tortured, worse than death. This film was nominated for a Golden Bear award at the 1985 Berlin Film Festival.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dHFuMAqAiOQeYkkVlWSvBz150Uz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Contar hasta diez","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
