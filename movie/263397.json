These brothers are not particularly exceptional as people go, but at least they have branched out into separate vocations in their lives. One brother is a doctor, another is a criminal, and the third is a bus driver. Like others in Europe, they suffered through World War II, yet no matter what their backgrounds and experiences, their interpersonal relationships are not exactly gripping drama.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vtfQnU9KXnIlhPVQkQDw3oNZCol.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Noc smaragdového měsíce","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
