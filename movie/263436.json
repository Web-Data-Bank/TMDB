Told in a sentimental tone, Burns weaves a lyrical tale of the great metropolis that encompasses not only the city's streets, but also that of the history of America. Though around fourteen hours in length, this epic documentary presents a thoughtful, entertaining look at our relatively young country.  This second installment finds the city as the largest port in the country. Waves of Irish and German immigrants flood into the city between 1825 and 1865 only to find that New York is not so welcoming to immigrants. Frederick Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux shape the city with their design for Central Park but social unrest still ran high for the working classes, coming to a climax with the draft riots of 1863.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"New York: Order and Disorder (1825–1865)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
