When the three men run into a former professor of the architect and designer, they are inspired by his fanfare and expansive nature. Still in search of solutions to their particular problems, the men head out to visit the professor and get to the bottom of their own issues. Unfortunately, the professor turns out to be more \"loco\" than otherwise, and the three men watch their hopes burst like a popped balloon -- it seems like their ability to assess human character should now be added to their list of problem spots.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yNzSXAnpcDIB54vtHtB4jWUQmyw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":99930,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film et Video Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":19538,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Productions Audiovisuelles","origin_country":""},{"id":1245,"logo_path":"/suKdkPTtHn0DzGYmrXCA506dJON.png","name":"TSR","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1982-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'amour des femmes","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
