When he hears that his mother is mortally ill, he returns to Munich to be at her bedside, but doesn't quite make it. He and sister Astrid (Elke Haltaufderheide) rediscover their friendship, though, as they go through a number of crises. Meanwhile, Anton makes an effort to find work in Munich, and runs headlong into the silliness and pretensions of the \"New German Cinema\" movement.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5JnP14sLZ0ITek6kAjac5wZCHY6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24825,"logo_path":null,"name":"Visual KW Film and Television Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1977-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die Vertreibung aus dem Paradies","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
