This Is Not a Dream explores the legacies of this revolution and its continued impact on contemporary art and performance.  Charting a path across four decades of avant-garde experiment and radical escapism, This Is Not a Dream traces the influences of Andy Warhol, John Waters and Jack Smith to the perverted frontiers of YouTube and Chatroulette, taking in subverted talk shows and soap operas, streetwalker fashions and glittery magic penises along the way.","popularity":0.656,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2012-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This Is Not a Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
