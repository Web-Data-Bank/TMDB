A queer Science Fiction, that engages the utopian impulses of the genre, not through the imagining of another world, but through the rendering of this world as Other. All subjects are treated as alien, or as radical others, who search for, or advance different ideological, psychological, or sexual ideals of belonging. Subjects oscillate between the contemplation of past societal traumas and idealizations of futurity that refuse to synthesize or resolve, but instead reveal a troubling satire of the present.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tLt6ygnVF5f8bdcQ3VsLlohxdF5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2287,"logo_path":null,"name":"Unity Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Unity of All Things","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":4}
