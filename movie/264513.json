The audio CD and DVD contain a live recording of a concert which the band performed at Dresden’s Reithalle. It’s characteristic of the band that this concert didn’t turn into a pure “greatest hits” event, but contains, along with their most popular hits, selected highlights from 25 years of band history. ”Live In Dresden” offers much more than an average live best-of.
