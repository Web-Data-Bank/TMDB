Hasse), a Nobel prizewinner for literature who was notorious for having collaborated with the Nazi regime. After the war, rather than hand him over for prosecution, he was sent to a retirement home. A young man, bitter about the war, tracks him down and begins to harass him in various ways. The author handles everything that comes to him with remarkable dignity, which eventually removes some of the taint from his actions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"1975-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eiszeit","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
