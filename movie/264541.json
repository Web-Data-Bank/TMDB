There he finds nothing but hardship and rejection, save from the town's mayor and a young servant girl, whom he marries.

The child of their marriage is taken away from him, and at this point he is left with the options of becoming a robber, starving to death, or emigrating.","popularity":0.65,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":210,"logo_path":"/cuIR8m2nnKkqPgnQz25FJT26aBa.png","name":"Süddeutscher Rundfunk","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":1627,"logo_path":"/kx8kRT0rStw6SVEJKgbknFyITA4.png","name":"Maran Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":17994,"logo_path":null,"name":"Independent Film GmbH","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1975-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"John Glückstadt","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
