The trial is given the full formal treatment it might receive in a civilian setting. The key point in this film is that these are the actual murderers admitting their actual crimes before a judges' panel consisting of their peers: actual prisoners at the same institution. Having no force of law, the trial proceeds without reaching a conclusion. That is something the viewer is asked to provide. This movie won a Silver Bear from the 1974 Berlin Film Festival.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":128,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Name of the People","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
