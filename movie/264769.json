Although she thinks nothing of the conversation, Sheila's life takes a surprising turn when her husband is murdered by Margo. Now Margo wants Sheila to do her part of \"the deal.\" With the police on her tail and Margo constantly in her face, Sheila must find a way out of this tangled web.","popularity":1.341,"poster_path":"/uZwa0Ye52VwUmgSS45H9k2uMAL9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1957,"logo_path":"/pJJw98MtNFC9cHn3o15G7vaUnnX.png","name":"Warner Bros.
