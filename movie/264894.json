The DVD includes many songs from The Dirty South album, as well as favorites from all of DBT's other records.  It also includes backstage footage and interviews with the band.  This DVD is a must have for all DBT fans.  \"Like our records, this is an artifact from a moment in time.  This DVD represents where the Drive-By Truckers were, in every sense of the word, on August 27th and 28th of 2004.  We're somewhere else now.  Come to see us.  Hell will once again be raised.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ruBjsfRYHl6P7WIXQVtzDkgdD4O.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21862,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aisle Five Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":134,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Drive-By Truckers: The Dirty South - Live at the 40-Watt","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
