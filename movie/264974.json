Mayor Lechner is in the end with his wisdom. The railway line is shut down, the spa guests stay out, and the mountain of debt is long since higher than the highest peak. The news of the imminent incorporation gives the much-plagued, who now also has to worry about office and dignity, the rest. But need makes inventive, and so easy can be such a fancy rascal as mayor Lechner not get down. As a savior in distress, Oberregierungsregierungsrat Dr. Schröder and submitted to Lechner the plans for a huge project to rehabilitate the bankrupt community. When he is also the re-commissioning of the railway line in view, Lechner attacks. Dr. Schröder's promise to lead Waldbrunn into a bright future lets the otherwise distrusting Lechner blindly fall into a cleverly sophisticated trap. Even Bärbel, the pretty daughter of the mayor, falls to the worldly Dr.. Schröder in.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/q0QJZ2WlQ8LSjD3MTcQ16TuuXQX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19229,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alois Brummer Produktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1981-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kursaison im Dirndlhöschen","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
