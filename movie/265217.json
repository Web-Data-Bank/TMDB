The concert was filmed, simulcast on ABC-TV and Triple J, and released on video, which was remastered for their 2004 Best of Both Worlds DVD.  Oils on the Water: A classic Midnight Oil performance was recorded on Goat Island in Sydney Harbour on 13 January 1985. Never before or since has the band performed in such a setting; every time Peter Garrett turned up stage he was caught in the light of the setting sun, reflected by the city and the Sydney Harbour Bridge.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aQGFfpwV7iuXDTFrkzsC2egtPPr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":183533,"logo_path":null,"name":"ABC Music Australia","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1985-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Midnight Oil Goat Island Triple J Concert","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
