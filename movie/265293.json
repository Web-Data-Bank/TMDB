It’s a polyphony. Anonymous voices that intertwine and overlap, answer and contradict each other. A descent into the depths of a city, fragments of life found in the streets or through cracks in walls, a slow wandering through the secret strata of a neighbourhood… pieces of a puzzle that don't easily fit in with each other.\r Place: La Joliette, a port district of Marseilles; to be more precise: a single block, half of which will be reduced to dust during this \"walk around the block\", that turns out to be as unpredictable as it is systematic.\r Time: towards the end of the “reconquest” of our cities, when fragile glass towers prospered on the ruins of relocated industries.\r Actors: some individuals, with conflicting interests, living in the midst of a development project that towers over them all, even those with the highest rank.\r The map of a sample of the world is sketched before our eyes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":137,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Plan de situation: Joliette","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
