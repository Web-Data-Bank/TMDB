We are filming young Lithuanian men working in Sweden. They do not want to be caught on camera, they do not want to participate in creating yet another media image of guilt and pity. They film us. We empty a bottle of moonshine, we dance on their porch. They might let us film them tomorrow. Second Class is a time document about class, respect, the value of work and human being.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rWMfGoPpQ2KZLtYw7YZrwYEZ6gk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125521,"logo_path":null,"name":"MDEMC Production AB","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2012-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvi≈≥"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Second Class","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
