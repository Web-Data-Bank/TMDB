His wife leaves him to live alone. His son, who is away at school, will not talk to him. He searches for meaning: he seeks the help of a jolly but dismissive physician; he talks to an underworld thug about having his wife murdered; he delves into the life of his driver, the happy-go-lucky Dinu, who has two wives and a mistress, all three of whom love Dinu, all three of whom Dinu cherishes; last, he returns in his mind to the magical possibilities of his childhood, when he could open doors using only a nursery rhyme.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7oh0fefki2R2rHkEw1cuJDj3BoT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1997-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lal Darja","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":4}
