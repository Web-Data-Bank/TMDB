It is the year, which will see the outbreak of the First World War.  In Hotel Sacher, the mood is excellent; and although the political atmosphere is charged, there’s an undercurrent of hate and intolerance in the air.  It is with this background that Nadja, a Russian spy, meets the Austrian civil servant Stefan.  He loves her, but comes under suspicion of being an agent because of this love.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rfR99qpk47SxD55DYq0omTFXoHL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32193,"logo_path":null,"name":"Deutsche Mondial Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1939-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hotel Sacher","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
