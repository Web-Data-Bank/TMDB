Although he is approaching adulthood, he is yet to finish 8th grade. He cannot reconcile his pride and sense of justice with the kind of education provided by people who are deprived of sensibility and human warmth. Rado asserts his right to freedom by frequently running away. During one of his escapes he meets the love of his life, Albena. She is a good student, and comes from a well-educated, sophisticated family. This new and unexpected connection intensifies Rado's desire for freedom and independence, and leads them both into uncharted territory.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gYT9TTKNN2FZTVQNcJygoxx4R0I.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15567,"logo_path":null,"name":"Boyana Film","origin_country":"BG"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","name":"Bulgaria"}],"release_date":"1979-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bulgarian","iso_639_1":"bg","name":"български език"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Everything is Love","video":false,"vote_average":8.1,"vote_count":7}
