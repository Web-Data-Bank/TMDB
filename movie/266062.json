He just killed the Prime Minister of his country. In order to do so, he had to act as if he was a crazy man, wandering through the city. His life comes back by flashes; his childhood with Tourou when his dream was to become a rain miracle-worker, his adventures with Gladys the eater, and his past as a young member of militia, in the heart of the politic and military conflict in Ivory Coast.

That's the reason why his name's Run.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/yTfYnBiZcyG8I5aJvyMwvOPbMKq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51742,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wassakara Productions","origin_country":"CI"},{"id":51743,"logo_path":null,"name":"Banshee Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":51744,"logo_path":null,"name":"Diam Production","origin_country":"BF"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CI","name":"Cote D'Ivoire"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2014-12-17","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Run","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":10}
