On a hot summer day, he begins to imagine that it's winterâ€”the residential street where he's parked transforms into snowy mountains, and a series of comic misadventures begin. As the car is replaced by a toboggan, it carries the tycoon away on a dizzying ride. The chase includes some unforgettable antics in the snow, including a piggyback ride on an incredulous skier.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eE2OweXimjnquWhY7vqfrTrw7vM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1963-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ride","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
