The creators (Adam Cooley/SeaMonster3D) aren't into drugs -- the show is here to ask the question, \"Why do people want to watch a show about a superhero who is on drugs?\" An absurdist existential essay on the idea of animation and superheroes, the core of the show is primarily about a pot-smoking superhero deer who knows he's on \"television\" and constantly talks to the audience about what it's like to be a superhero. He is fully aware he is being animated.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-07-28","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blaze the Pot Smoking Deer","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
