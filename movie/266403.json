Gregers moves in with the Ekdals with the intention of allowing unsuspecting Hjalmar and his family to share in the \"happiness of truth\".  Hedwig is entirely devoted to a wild duck, which lives on a pond outside their house.\r When Hjalmar learns the truth about his daughter, he wants to leave his family.
