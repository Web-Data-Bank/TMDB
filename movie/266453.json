Mickey McGuigan, a lively 73 year old farmer turned writer, has been documenting those around him along the Northern Irish border. The stories may defy logic, but people swear by them. This is a disappearing world of folklore and magic. There's a man who cures ringworm on cows by spitting on them and a woman who can cure sick babies with a piece of string. We'll also meet a healer who claims he can cure cancer. He now has a six month waiting list of hundreds op people hoping for a miracle. This is a cinematic journey through the hidden world of rural Northern Ireland, where anything is possible.","popularity":0.874,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Miraculous Tales","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
