For ten years, he temporarily lives with his married sister in a cramped, one-room apartment in which, his brother's-in-law sister also temporarily lives. He has a diploma, but not a steady job. He's a school teacher for a definite period of time with a \"temporary\" status. At the mean time, a boy who lives alone with his mother goes to the same school. He wants to have a father by his own choice, not his mother's. It seems that the teacher suits most of the boy's idea of a father. And the boy gains what he always wants.","popularity":0.726,"poster_path":"/6nGiQsjmSLd2g0WXwfbP4jKtsGn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5940,"logo_path":null,"name":"Avala Film","origin_country":"RS"},{"id":16785,"logo_path":null,"name":"Croatia Film","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"YU","name":"Yugoslavia"}],"release_date":"1980-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"},{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Part-Time Work","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4}
