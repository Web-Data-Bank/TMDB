Sometimes described as frustrating and self-centered, reactions to this film swing across a broad spectrum of complaints -- not the least might be whether or not Gainsbourg is using a clichéd and stereotypical view of \"dark Africa\" to convey what he sees in his characters.","popularity":1.634,"poster_path":"/s9z9UWmaEA20CnjQISgZ47rRnhV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":36812,"logo_path":"/t0cibwMPVH7RD7UsQNqmugDMnw7.png","name":"Gaumont International Television","origin_country":"US"},{"id":9,"logo_path":"/nda3dTUYdDrJ6rZqBpYvY865aDv.png","name":"Gaumont","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":113916,"logo_path":null,"name":"Corso Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":356,"logo_path":"/tSJvuFaLIp7l0ONLUiAHA61GbXu.png","name":"TF1 Films Production","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":113917,"logo_path":null,"name":"Etat Gabonais","origin_country":"GA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GA","name":"Gabon"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1983-08-17","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Equator","video":false,"vote_average":3.8,"vote_count":5}
