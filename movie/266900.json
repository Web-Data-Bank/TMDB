In 1988, thousands of activists hold the Food and Drug Administration under siege, demanding speedier drug approval. In 1990 AIDS activists converge on the National Institute of Health, calling for a more equitable clinical trial system and expanded research into new drugs and treatment. Voices From the Front, the first feature-length documentary on AIDS activism in America, makes clear the emotional and political effects of community activism using the voices of those directly engaged. It is a powerful distillation of pictures and words from events organized to change public consciousness, expose the failure of the health care systems, and challenge government inaction and neglect concerning AIDS.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/vkGJVF5yV6ZnDnLrhwWWE4Jctgz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Voices from the Front","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
