It is 1912, and the old man still believes in the old rules which strait-jacket \"men of class.\" He believes that the elite have the right to conquer where they can, that they should refrain from publicizing their improprieties, and he is rabidly pro-military. Adrian, kicked out of his military school for his own improprieties (and hiding that from his father), is naturally drawn to Vicky a beautiful divorced woman and friend of the family who is staying at their mansion. The family tutor, a man of ordinary background (with some ideas which seem radical in this household) is similarly smitten. On the basis of their shared attraction, the two men form a friendship. Meanwhile, the object of their affection finds it diverting to toy with them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xPkIkwaR5bEjPKcmDxxskBID3ng.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1061,"logo_path":null,"name":"Partner's Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1989-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Comédie d'été","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
