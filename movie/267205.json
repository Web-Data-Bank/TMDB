His stylised portraits come to live and edge him further towards death. Choreographer Stuart has transformed his images into a transparent movement language that by turns follows and ignores the music by Alexander von Zemlinsky. The rawly expressive and confrontational imagery reflects the powerful effect of Schieleâ€™s drawings and paintings.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":22519,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dutch Mountain Movies","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2013-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Egon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
