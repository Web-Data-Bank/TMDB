This year more than 36 million people will die from degenerative conditions – more than from all other causes put together*, and that number is expected to rise to over 50 million within 15 years. At the same time, the amount spent trying to treat these diseases with pharmaceutical drugs is expected to rise by 50% to more than $1.2 trillion!  One summer Jason Vale took eight people who collectively suffered from 22 different chronic diseases and put them on his ‘Juice Only’ diet for 28 days. Could these different diseases with their many different prescribed drugs be improved and even cured by one thing? Maybe it’s time to get Super Juiced!","popularity":1.123,"poster_path":"/7IAcjcowEme3pGDcUAQ07RXbMdq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"8 people… 22 diseases… 28 days… 1 answer?","title":"Super Juice Me!","video":true,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":9}
