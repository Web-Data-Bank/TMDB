We're talking about more than a simple commitment to a creed or an ideology, we're talking about accepting to be a part of a world created out of your own convictions, and eluding any coexistence with everything that's different from that. How do you film this semi-limbo that has its own notion of time and history? This seems to be the question Nikolas Klement asks himself in his first film, a documentary that goes deep into a Mennonite community in La Pampa and portrays its everyday activities.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2013-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ekpyrosis","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
