Coniferous and subtropical forests, wetlands, and montane grasslands are as much a part of this world as the inhospitable, frozen mountaintops that tower above.  The word Himalaya is Sanskrit for abode of snow, fitting for a stretch of land that houses the worldâ€™s largest non polar ice masses. Extensive glacial networks feed Asia's major rivers including the Ganges, Indus, and Brahmaputra. More than a billion people rely on these glacier-fed water sources for drinking water and agriculture. The Himalayas are not only a remarkable expanse of natural beauty. They're also crucial for our survival.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/lzUQXMeP5gkdLxjmgFW1q9DL0zM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15964,"logo_path":null,"name":"PBS International","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nature: The Himalayas","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
