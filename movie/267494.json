Most interesting is the history of the Pullman car.  In the beginning, it served as transport for a princely family; then became the headquarters car for the military high command; and then, most adventurous of all, it ended up with a circus.  Converted to a bar, it finally had its day and was supposed to serve as a placard carrier.
