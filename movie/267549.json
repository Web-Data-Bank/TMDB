He looks for work, but it’s difficult to find, as he is now in his late 30s. The more he comes to terms with his reality, the more he feels defeated. When his loneliness gets too hard to bear, he thinks back on days he had with his mother when he was younger. Those good times are a trip down memory lane, and through that, he finds peace of mind. But reality is what it is; it doesn't change.","popularity":0.806,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Discipline","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
