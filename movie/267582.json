Felice Romani wrote the Italian libretto, after Eug√®ne Scribe's libretto for Daniel Auber's Le philtre (1831).  Written in haste in a six-week period,[1] L'elisir d'amore was the most often performed opera in Italy between 1838 and 1848[1] and it has remained continually in the international opera repertory. Today it is one of the most frequently performed of all Donizetti's operas: it appears as number 13 on the Operabase list of the most-performed operas worldwide in the five seasons between 2008 and 2013.[2] There are a large number of recordings. It contains the popular tenor aria \"Una furtiva lagrima,\" a romanza that has a considerable performance history in the concert hall.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kirC8G1E315IBzmTgr47HzHNFwb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18872,"logo_path":"/9PNdO6L1bh8ZVjIwOKjveRia3Ku.png","name":"Decca","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Donizetti: L'Elisir d'amore","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
