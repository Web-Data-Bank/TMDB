Using source material from Emmanuelle 6, this DVD-R/VHS further blurs the line between low and high art. Beautiful cinematography coupled with smut. Strategic pauses and tracking errors guides the viewer to discover the true depth and sadness of the seemingly one-dimensional Emmanuelle. Soaring arpeggio synths and pulsating rhythms by Rob Feulner. The utter destruction of arguably the most beautiful film never seen, lost and forgotten on the shelf of your local video store, behind the cowboy doors or dangling beads. Written off as pornography by most, written off as too soft by creeps. This is the plight of Emmanuelle.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zrJbK2Ixb60MsOrln1zliXt5Zg6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74258,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bleu Nuit Video","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2014-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Faces of Emmanuelle","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
