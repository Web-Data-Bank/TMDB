The story takes place in times of elections in Mexico. A candidate for Governor runs over a pregnant migrant. After the accident, and to avoid a possible scandal, he hides her in a building he owns. Pressured by his political boss and so as not to ruin his political career, the candidate evicts the migrant. In a non-realistic style, the film focuses on the stories that surround the migrant during her search for a room. A radical film, with a critical gaze, that reflects the spirit of contemporary Mexican society.","popularity":0.78,"poster_path":"/zEXp8c6qc7TjH1AVcbXMdLau2Tq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22694,"logo_path":null,"name":"Creadores Contemporaneos","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2014-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"This is the law of the jungle","title":"1 For 1","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":5}
