Ambitious cop Derek (Hall) is dogged by a phobia that is unfortunate in his line of work. Having witnessed his father's murder as a young child, he is deathly afraid of blood, but when he takes the law into his own hands to catch underworld counterfeiter Gustoff Slovak, he is forced to face his fear. The operation blows up in his face, resulting in a massacre that leaves Derek the only one of his team to survive. Derek reaches the shocking conclusion that Slovak is actually a vampire, and joins forces with the last in a long line of vampire hunters, Master Kao, who agrees to train Derek in his ancient art. However, in order to combat Slovak--whose past intersects with Derek's own in disturbing ways--Derek must become that which he hates the most: a vampire.","popularity":0.999,"poster_path":"/zHgrYaOKGhOTU0m8lVyGMANiYZe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1632,"logo_path":"/cisLn1YAUuptXVBa0xjq7ST9cH0.png","name":"Lionsgate","origin_country":"US"},{"id":8605,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cine Excel Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-08-09","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The bounty is blood.","title":"Vampire Assassin","video":false,"vote_average":2.9,"vote_count":5}
