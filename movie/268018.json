If you work full time, you should not be poor, but more than 30 million Americans - one in four workers - are stuck in low wage jobs that do not provide the basics for a decent life. WAGING A LIVING chronicles the battle of four low-wage workers to lift their families out of poverty. Shot over a three-year period in the northeast and California, this observational documentary captures the dreams, frustrations, and accomplishments of a diverse group of workers who struggle to live from paycheck to paycheck. By presenting an unvarnished look at the barriers that these workers must overcome to escape poverty, WAGING A LIVING offers a sobering view of the elusive American Dream.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Waging A Living","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
