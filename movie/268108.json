When the social worker finds out she leaves her sister alone in the house while at work, she is forced to place her in a day-care center.  For the first time in her life she shares the upbringing of her dear sister with someone else, her daily routine collapses and the huge void, left by her sister's absence, makes room for a man in Rachel's life. That man, Zohar, tears another crack in the symbiotic relationship of the two sisters. Rachel hangs on to his love as if it was a life belt.  But her inability to lead a normal, intimate and emotional relationship with anyone but her sister, forces them into a twisted threesome, where boundaries between love, sacrifice, nurturing and torturing – are broken.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wQw5fZujA0dsz6ye9TlVhHXiXI6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2014-05-22","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Next to Her","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":16}
