There is no better way to commemorate and preserve this period of time by releasing The Live Tapes Vol. 1: Live At The Hordern Pavilion. Hard to believe itâ€™s the first live release since Ringside 10 years ago. Two CDs and a DVD (or BluRay) makes for an awesome package with all the hits such as Flame Trees, Khe Sanh, Cheap Wine and Choir Girl, plus a taster of newer material also.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tzzFhdehps1hw3ZbIrcTRK6maWw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cold Chisel: The Live Tapes - Volume 1","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
