It was the first time that simple security cameras of a hotel caught secret agents red-handed, what's more Israeli agents. But without doubt, the most surprised of all were the Mossad leaders who were the only ones to know for sure that the 3 men and the woman, whose faces were in all the newsrooms of the world, had nothing to do with them. From then on, a race against time is undertaken hoping to understand why everything is aiming at them.","popularity":2.486,"poster_path":"/w0vhppGom9px5vVb0Lcssg8gIpN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11620,"logo_path":"/f3hRdCaK1w9qH1Qs8nLd2L2bae1.png","name":"OCS","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":36067,"logo_path":"/saYC0yKR2msFHaa4oXMXF3hNogn.png","name":"Topia Communications","origin_country":"IL"},{"id":16,"logo_path":"/7690NQfOfnbvrY3vFgyMO2Pc8WS.png","name":"United King Films","origin_country":"IL"},{"id":24477,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rabinovich Film Fund Cinema Project","origin_country":"IL"},{"id":30233,"logo_path":"/4vLhnE0fxPiqm01waJBkeVVJF1j.png","name":"Cinémage","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":20655,"logo_path":"/kbJVVP3nKf5YEPIeZ9P0hP1gaQu.png","name":"A Plus Image 3","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2013-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kidon","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":59}
