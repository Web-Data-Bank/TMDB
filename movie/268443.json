At 7.15 am, on 30th June 1908, a giant fireball, as bright the sun, exploded in the sky over Tunguska in central Siberia. Its force was equivalent to twenty million tonnes of TNT, and a thousand times greater than that of the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima in 1945. An estimated sixty million trees were felled over an area of over two thousand square kilometres - an area over half the size of Rhode Island. If the explosion had occurred over London or Paris, hundreds of thousands of people would have been killed.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-12-28","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Siberian Apocalypse","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
