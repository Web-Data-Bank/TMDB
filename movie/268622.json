While Ross wrestles with his conscience and attempts to convince Greta Manarang, television newscaster and grieving girlfriend of a recently murdered journalist, of his newfound integrity in Manila, Azad and Claire, local journalists who are deep into the tracks of Ghazi, are hunted down by Ghaziâ€™s henchmen. Their stories eventually intertwine, revealing a more frustrated than concerned outlook of the state of free speech in a country that supposedly fosters democracy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pL2CL7fhcG0X59GtEL0bwUpExQ5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deadline","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
