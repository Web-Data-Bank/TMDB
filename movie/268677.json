Comprised of several short films by some of the world's most exciting directors, Words with Gods follows the theme of religion - specifically as it relates to an individual's relationship with his/her god or gods...or the lack thereof.  In Words with Gods, each director recounts a narrative centered around human fragility, as well as environmental and cultural crises involving specific religions with which each has a personal relationship; including early Aboriginal Spirituality, Umbanda, Buddhism, the Abrahamic faiths, Hinduism, and Atheism. An animated sequence by Mexican animator Maribel Martinez is woven through each of the film segments, with each segment narratively connected as a feature-length film.","popularity":1.401,"poster_path":"/hlVeqMN4wbP8r8WbM4UcAvMjKpj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":30531,"logo_path":null,"name":"BN Films","origin_country":""},{"id":93550,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mijfilm Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":133,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It is time to know each other","title":"Words with Gods","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":4}
