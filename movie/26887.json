Travis rode out of the completed trick, but re-named it the TP7 as he still needs 20 degrees of rotation to call it perfect! Chad Reed made a guest appearance as a Nitro Circus Crew member and took part in some explosive Supercross action caught in its full glory on super high speed cameras. The results were incredible! As a final gesture to confirm that Chad has really joined the Circus, he rode over to the scene of Travis' TP7 and proceeded to land his first ever backflip â€” all on his full factory 450 Suzuki!","popularity":1.735,"poster_path":"/5GyBaEtEinwS4Cgx1sqxKTcvZaQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10558,"logo_path":"/d5hpkDfsu0tf6aIG506WilBNJ6V.png","name":"Godfrey Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nitro Circus 7 Country Fried","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
