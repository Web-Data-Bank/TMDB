One Monday he can no longer face the tedium of both his work and his life and so he stays home and rebels by playing with toys and joining in on a radio concert with his own instruments. His erratic behavior does not go unnoticed and soon a winsome psychiatrist whom he knows and secretly admires, is right there trying to help him. The newly liberated bank manager logically grasps this opportunity to press forward his innermost feelings.","popularity":1.091,"poster_path":"/b3pl5CPmXPwfEc4M1wIndrTegIK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95908,"logo_path":null,"name":"Peter Goldbaum Produktion","origin_country":""},{"id":2078,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sokal-Film GmbH","origin_country":""},{"id":18908,"logo_path":null,"name":"Central Cinema Company Film (CCC)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1959-07-13","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"And That on Monday Morning","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
