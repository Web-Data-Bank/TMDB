How one man defied the very followers of Jesus himself... and in the end left his homeland to conquer an Empire. This is the compelling story of Paul the Apostle, originally named Saul of Tarsus. He zealously persecuted the early followers of Jesus and violently tried to destroy the newly forming Christian church. Paul s dramatic conversion on the road to Damascus radically changed the course of his life. After his conversion, Paul began to preach that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God. He is generally considered one of the most important figures of the Apostolic Age.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ykHcpzZaHanE65PZg0wtI3Evi7s.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"An Apostle's Final Bid.","title":"Apostle Paul: A Polite Bribe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
