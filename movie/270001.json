Inspired by Virginia Woolf’s Orlando, Ottinger’s allegorical work explores themes of death, destruction, and resurrection. With striking camerawork reminiscent of the antics of avant-garde psychodramas, Laocoon & Sons is filled with an exuberant sense of life, myth, tradition, and magic.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/l5KMR9zKP2njVKjvQrs6EVwQuSH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1975-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Laocoon & Sons","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
