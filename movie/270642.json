Children were stolen from their families and brainwashed to be soldiers. Girls were degraded to sex slaves for Kony's officers. The gunfire has ceased, but one battle remains-the battle to restore the future of the children of Uganda. Forest Whitaker tells this story of one woman's fight to bring hope back to her nation. Sister Rosemary Nyirumbe leads a vocational school in Gulu, Uganda, where she uses practical skills to restore dignity, independence, and hope to formerly abducted women.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sewing Hope","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
