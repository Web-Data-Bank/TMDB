This way of life influenced the anti-establishment style and attitude that defined a generation. The cultural phenomenon was best captured when Volcom released \"Alive We Ride\" in 1993: a film documenting the raw excitement and spontaneous creativity inherent to the lifestyle. Twenty-one years later, with the release of \"True To This\", Volcom again captures the energy and artistry of board-riding in its purest forms. Shot all around the world and showcasing iconic athletes, \"True To This\" is a tribute to the movement that inspired a generation and the people and places that embody that spirit today.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/dU8FWlrA6Am0EKIDArEqKnCMdvJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Volcom: True to This","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
