Toby, bright-eyed and spunky, Finner, aristocratic and thoughtful, and Gillis, a big \"galumphing\" guppy who calmly takes everything in stride. Meeting a \"damsel\" clearly not in distress, the would-be heroes comically try to help her recover a large pearl. But it isn't long before all four of them are swimming for their lives, and The Three Fishketeers finally learn what heroism really is.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/lzHMtCYuwrDGr4NuggAkPQMVf8E.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81764,"logo_path":null,"name":"Perennial Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1987-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Three Fishketeers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
