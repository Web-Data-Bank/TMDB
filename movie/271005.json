It's an outrageous blend of Slacker, Gregg Araki's The Doom Generation and the brutal cinema of Alan Clarke - telling the story of those whose existence is without meaning and who see no point in living other than killing and dying.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cWfUCJBnXcVulXQEXHGh3GllKT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4686,"logo_path":null,"name":"E.I.
