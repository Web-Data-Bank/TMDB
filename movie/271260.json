Sidibe's snapshots from the late 50s through to the early 70s capture the carefree spirit of a youth asserting their freedom from colonialism in the early days of Malian independence - until a coup ushered in decades of austere military dictatorship. So this is a film not only about art, but also about a culture reflected through a camera lens, in a country that today is one of the poorest in the world.","popularity":0.842,"poster_path":"/2zmm3ekpkB0Qh088jIpzdsRww29.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78496,"logo_path":"/e8JC6pK5BRyFhCLmIq0F9rcSqGZ.png","name":"Tigerlily Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bambara","iso_639_1":"bm","name":"Bamanankan"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dolce Vita Africana","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
