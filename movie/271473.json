Set in various locations - including a gymnasium, an abandoned hospital, and a trailer park circus - Martin and Olsen slip between a ventriloquist and his dummy, a seducer and his surrogate, a doctor and his patient, and synchronized dance partners. The film examines a complex social psychology - questioning the colonization of the human body for various political, medical and religious agendas.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"29 incidents of dual consequence","title":"A Heretic's Primer on Love and Exertion","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
