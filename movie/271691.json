In the story, a young forest ranger who sees that his work holds the key to the future of his country (through reforestation) is disgusted at the short-sighted, money-grubbing ways of his superiors. He has a much better relationship with local villagers than with his agency's bosses. As the movie opens, the villagers are preparing to hold a hunting ceremony but are not sure whether they will do it the old fashioned way, with a bonfire, or will obey a government decree that open fires are too dangerous. There is a lot of sexual teasing between the villagers, including some harmless horseplay. For instance, when a man whispers another woman's name in his sleep, his wife pours water into his ear in revenge.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":84261,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kora Films","origin_country":""},{"id":93505,"logo_path":null,"name":"C.N.P.C.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ML","name":"Mali"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1991-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"},{"english_name":"Bambara","iso_639_1":"bm","name":"Bamanankan"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fire!","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4}
