The book and film earned the condemnation of conservative critics, however the author's leftist subtext went unchallenged overshadowed by the sexual themes. The film was the best selling Korean film of the 1970s and made a star of its female lead, Chang Mi-hee.","popularity":1.011,"poster_path":"/j9Iz4nkldiAQxflmQgwViIwvUAS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":43643,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hwacheon Trading","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"1977-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Winter Woman","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":5}
