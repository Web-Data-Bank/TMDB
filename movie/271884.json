This seriocomic drama follows the deposed royals as they adapt to their new lives. The former king has recognized the political finality of his deposition, but his queen has taken to traveling in men's clothing all over Italy trying to foment an uprising to restore them to the throne. She is also frantic to have a baby, an heir, but the king has become celibate as a kind of homage to his beloved mother; he spends all his time lobbying the Vatican to get her declared a saint.","popularity":2.295,"poster_path":"/oXcNgEaNp69x13gXb23SzZBqOPK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4420,"logo_path":"/pXxqTCJMn9dgFUsANd2eCZxRDEa.png","name":"Clemi Cinematografica","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":641,"logo_path":"/w8flpSJntsxVCMkIU1qeg1kJcJh.png","name":"Titanus","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1989-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"'o Re","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":29}
