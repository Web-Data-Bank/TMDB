Khader is a young man whose family's crushing debts force him to choose between his dream of becoming an actor or abandoning everything to become an illegal alien in Europe. Rabia is an opinionated, ambitious young woman, with strong religious beliefs, struggling to open a clothing store while waiting for the return of her boyfriend. Youssef, a small-time drug dealer coming out of prison, follows any clue he comes upon in search of his brother, who had disappeared without a trace. How will these three young people build their futures? Ordinary Boys is a fly-on-the-wall film that provides a vision from within of what life is truly like in a poor Muslim community.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fd97mCN5b2VEn7mChqhk2Z57Ab.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10070,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alea Docs \u0026 Films","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2008-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ordinary Boys","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
