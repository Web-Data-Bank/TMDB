Captured at a February 2012 gig in London, Brixton finds the Georgia prog-sludge mainstays barreling through 23 choice cuts from their five good-to-classic LPs, 2002's Remission through 2011's The Hunter, a typically remarkable performance from a band whose live prowess rivals their in-studio wizardry. Like most overviews, the song selection's arguable, the impact of even the highest highs altered in their uprooting. But Brixton does the same rep-cementing, catalog-calcifying work a good hits comp is supposed to, further solidifying Mastodon's spot among the greatest big-ticket metal bands going.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/m8ZRozMxgvihT3OTrTPt3Oisv1T.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mastodon - Live at Brixton","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
