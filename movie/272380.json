This short documentary shows the capital of the Cameroon, Yaondé, but might equally show other African cities: heaps of rubbish lie at the edge of streets, academics are out of work, officials unpaid, corruption is the norm, and misery everywhere. For Jean-Marie Teno 'colonization, civilization, independence, then humanitarian talk are merely excuses and theatrical gestures to ensure that Africa remains the place which foreign powers can exploit with a good conscience.'","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":38153,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films du Raphia","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CM","name":"Cameroon"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1994-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Head in the Clouds","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":4}
