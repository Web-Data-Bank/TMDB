Burroughs On the Road","overview":"A portrait of the American Beat Generation writer William S. Burroughs (1914-1997) based on never-before-seen footage from his visit to Denmark in October 1983, and from his later years in Lawrence, Kansas. After having spent more than a quarter of a century outside of the United States, in Mexico, Tangier, Paris and London, Burroughs returned to New York in 1974. Shortly after, he began touring and reading his work to new generations of readers and thus establishing himself as a cult figure. The film focuses on Burroughs' unique talent as a performer, and on his later work, especially what is known as The Last Trilogy. In addition to the historic footage there are new interviews with friends and colleagues.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dLvDFgy0Bj279mMkTPwesult0Fp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Words of Advice: William S.
