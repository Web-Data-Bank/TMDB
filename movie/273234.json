She set out to make a film about the dressmaker, an African-American seamstress who had recently passed away. The dresses and much of the film footage were later flood-damaged by Hurricane Katrina while Helen was still working on the film. Helen was murdered in a home invasion in New Orleans in 2007. Her husband Paul Gailiunas has completed the film, which includes Helen's original silhouette, cut-out, and puppet animation, as well as flood-damaged and restored home movies.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/l25wm6DngznVMMOFf093aOZyQG5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Florestine Collection","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
