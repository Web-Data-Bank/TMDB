Adapted from Edward Bulwer-Lytton’s love story, the film was innovative in its special effects and an early major box-office hit. A beautiful tinted restoration print was prepared using photochemical processes by Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia-Cineteca Nazionale in the mid-1990s and the premiere screening of the restoration print was held in the amphitheatre in Pompeii, followed by a screening at the major restoration festival ‘Il Cinema Ritrovato’ in Bologna in 1998.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/9wUAqCJgwJLp775ChC5GNdBQ5xb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":175976,"logo_path":null,"name":"Società Italiana Grandi Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1926-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":196,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Days of Pompeii","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4}
