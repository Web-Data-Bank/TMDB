Hans Keller visited the same countries and places in order to make a film about the life and work of this man, who could only live in hotels. Keller creates a beautiful synthesis between Europe as Roth knew it and the present-day Europe. In the loving look at the different locations, the continuity of past and present reveals itself. Intermittently, tableaux in a copied 'Bioskoptheater' show scenes from the author's life. Finally, a film script which was once rejected by Hollywood yet comes alive.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Joseph Roth's Grosse-Welt-Bioskop-Theater","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
