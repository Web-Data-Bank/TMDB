He meets a nightclub performer played by de Rossi. The two have an affair, perhaps even fall in love, but Bagatsing hesitates to commit himself to her. De Rossi tells Bagatsing the story of one of her lovers, played by Rodel Velayo; Velayo was once chauffeur to the beautiful but spoiled daughter (again, de Rossi) of a wealthy fishpond operator. De Rossi is kidnapped, Velayo helps her escape; when she learns of his involvement in the plot, she leaves him. Velayo wanders about, until he meets de Rossi in the nightclub; he insists that nightclub de Rossi is really his long-lost de Rossi, and pursues her with fierce intensity. Bagatsing feels threatened by Velayo’s presence, even jealous, and the two struggle over the woman they both think they love.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/CyQ9YKxZtSjP52XQiatiSBXJey.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12707,"logo_path":null,"name":"Seiko Films","origin_country":"PH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2001-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sisid","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
