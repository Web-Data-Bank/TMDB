Spilling patches of colors are arranged in the form of cowboys and horses, creating a surprising and brilliant parody of the western. Animation is also an intriguing self-comment: the viewer watches not only the struggle between good and evil, but also the process of creating a film world. Made in 1960, the award-winning Little Western is the first fully auteur movie in the history of Polish animation - the director and screenwriter in one person also took care of the visual development of the film.","popularity":0.871,"poster_path":"/9DS7CGlNabT1iVOvFslVkCW9Z1i.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19066,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Miniatur Filmowych","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1961-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Little Western","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
