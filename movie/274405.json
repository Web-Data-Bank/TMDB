Set within an isolated desert landscape contrasted with recognizable scenes of the intensity of family life, this vanguard work demonstrates the richness and variety of the black experience; it is a poetic and hard-hitting commentary on the complexities of race, gender and sexuality.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/35tIrNcXRNFpsOtX04WEJsumrRa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16228,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sankofa Film \u0026 Video","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1986-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Passion of Remembrance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
