An independent memoir written, directed and produced by an American who worked in Ma's company for eight years, Crocodile in the Yangtze captures the emotional ups and downs of life in a Chinese Internet startup at a time when the Internet brought China face-to-face with the West.  Crocodile in the Yangtze draws on 200 hours of archival footage filmed by over 35 sources between 1995 and 2009. The film presents a strikingly candid portrait of Ma and his company, told from the point of view of an “American fly on a Chinese wall” who witnessed the successes and the mistakes Alibaba encountered as it grew from a small apartment into a global company employing 16,000 staff.","popularity":0.929,"poster_path":"/u04HlKlRP7abRRUCFUVCzYxo0U3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24572,"logo_path":null,"name":"Taluswood Films","origin_country":""},{"id":24573,"logo_path":null,"name":"Purple Reel Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crocodile in the Yangtze","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
