What If... had gone gold in Japan and the band lined up 11 Japanese dates in support of the release. At the end of January 2011, during a weeklong promotional trip to promote the album and tour, they were invited to the WOWOW TV Studios in Tokyo to perform a special acoustic show. When the talk of a broadcast first came up, Mr. Big wanted to present something different than they've ever done before, thus the idea of an acoustic show came about and a string quintet was brought in to enhance the project even more. The result from that magic night in Tokyo is now here: 10 Mr. Big classics in a completely new and fresh setting and a unique portrait of the band during their very first acoustic show.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":24591,"logo_path":null,"name":"Frontiers Records","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Mr. Big","title":"Mr. Big: Live From The Living Room","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
