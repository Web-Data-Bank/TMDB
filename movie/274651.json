Researching, writing, and revising this book, he spent many years privately interviewing members of Hitler’s staff and his generals. When it appeared in 1977, it was an instant best-seller. This film version was broadcast many times on PBS in North America, and in countries around the world, including Israel.  Combining Irving’s script with the film and newsreel footage of the time, the Edinburgh film company Lamancha closely collaborated with the author in the production of this film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/486gZU5dRZ5kSTpz6KizHil64B6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2005-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hitler's War","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
