Between 1996 and 2006, despite warnings of an impending food shortage, prices for farm goods dropped to their lowest point in Canadian history, driving many farmers off the land. With a family history of farming spanning generations, the Sudermans now face a challenge that threatens to pull the family apart. As Steve Suderman films his family, the fight for economic survival becomes a poignant story of hope, determination, and the search for purpose.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2008-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"a farm story, inside out.","title":"Over Land","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
