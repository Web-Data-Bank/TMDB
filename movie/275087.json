He soon became a leading figure in theater and film on the American Continent. Singled out by critics as a destroyer of the language, he quickly won the approval of the public. His ability to improvise revolutionized the film industry. His talent as an actor, singer, dancer and comedian contributed to the Golden Age of Mexican Cinema. From El Hijo Desobediente to Capitán Mantarraya, from Cuidad Juárez to Havana, from mambo to rock, the legacy of Tin Tan makes him one of the great icons of Mexico today. This film tells his story as it has never been told before.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":17822,"logo_path":null,"name":"Macondo Films","origin_country":""},{"id":299,"logo_path":"/elssmtHcogGtF8Gxokh9phZvLKi.png","name":"Instituto Mexicano de Cinematografía","origin_country":"MX"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2010-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tin Tan","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":4}
