Petey plays in a band and works in a pornography warehouse; Ginger works the night shift in a bar. From opposite coasts of the country, the two provide their personal takes on individual vs. collective crisis, together weaving a narrative that exposes a wasteland of shattered economic dreams, unfulfilled social promises and a bleak reality that only music and friendship can float freely above.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ui2yTejIhULEoN2caw73b2YLtS0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8666,"logo_path":"/ivI7Rdt2gaH8VNeoIGtks3oRlzR.png","name":"Beofilm","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":51591,"logo_path":null,"name":"Silverosa Film","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":168723,"logo_path":null,"name":"Smog Veil Films","origin_country":""},{"id":13150,"logo_path":"/v9s0IXHruAX6APhu08b8FItrIf1.png","name":"Naked Edge Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":12477,"logo_path":"/tuREvnCzrM5sNXyrKRFCyB1gHF8.png","name":"Film i Sk√•ne","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Petey & Ginger","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
