Over the course of a 5 day voyage they not only explore the most spectacular landscapes on earth, but embark on their own artistic response to the wilderness and to its history - in particular the legacy of William Hodges, ship's artist with Captain Cook in 1773.  The Waterfall brings some of New Zealand's most renowned contemporary artists to Fiordland, and to the screen: Gerda Leenards, John Walsh, Nigel Brown and Melvin 'Pat' Day. The story follows the artistic process of each, from the sketches \"en plain air\" to the final artwork.  A work of art in itself, The Waterfall combines good characters, a great yarn, humour and stunning imagery within the natural canvas of World Heritage Status Fiordland.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":24974,"logo_path":null,"name":"Watershed Films","origin_country":"NZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"2010-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Four of New Zealand's most celebrated artists journey to Fiordland.
