The composer’s music is brought to life on screen through a choreographic staging where actors and dancers, who are seen alternately by themselves or in the company of musicians, attempt to recreate, within a symbolic decor, the universe inhabited by the two lovers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":162781,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ciné Qua Non Média","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2001-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frédéric and George","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
