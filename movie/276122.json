When Ashleigh was hired to voice Apple Jack and Rainbow Dash for Hasbro's fourth series to use the My Little Pony name - My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic - she had no idea she would become an Internet phenomenon and major celebrity to a worldwide fan-base of grownups. Bronies are united by their belief in the show's philosophy. This documentary gives an inside view of the Pony fan-world, and an intimate look at the courage it takes to just be yourself...even when that means liking a little girls' cartoon.","popularity":2.833,"poster_path":"/gSivRsSKGLDF5uBCk3rncyhJ44z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27863,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hodgee Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A film about men....who like My Little Pony","title":"A Brony Tale","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":21}
