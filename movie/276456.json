The killing, it soon emerged, was linked to a teen satanic cult. Perhaps more disturbing than the details of the murder itself was the revelation of a conspiracy of silence among the town's teenagers, many of whom had been aware of the, e killing in the two weeks before an anonymous call finally tipped off local police. 17- year-old Ricky Kasso was arrested and confessed to the crime; five days later, he hung himself in his holding cell. Kasso's friend Jimmy Troiano also. confessed, but was acquitted after jurors learned that he was beaten by local police.\r The murder shocked the local community and reverberated nationally, with some uninformed observers rushing to scapegoat rock music as the cause.","popularity":0.871,"poster_path":"/70WAMDXpx8a61P6RJbKs8AL5n4L.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81635,"logo_path":null,"name":"Image Group Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Satan in the Suburbs","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
