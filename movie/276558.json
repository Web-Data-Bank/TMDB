On a terribly stormy night, in a secluded hotel, the owner, Brigadier Norton, is murdered. Prime suspects: his daughter Elena, his second wife Liza, Liza’s niece and her fiancé, Norton’s physician, and the hotel staff. Inspector Fox and his assistant, policeman Petridis, are assigned the investigation of the crime. While the suspects’ questioning is under way, some more people arrive at the hotel: detective Tilemachos Christofis with his assistant Aliki, and lieutenant Karalis, a sworn enemy of the victim, complicating things even more.","popularity":1.091,"poster_path":"/6U1G1uxRgJgA3ozTTYTmpl41lFj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12093,"logo_path":"/a5l879HvnNElhZ5gxRWB5QVBuUp.png","name":"Finos Film","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"1961-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Death Will Return","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
