His wife Nelle, who sometimes abuses drugs, spoils his ingrate teenage stepdaughter Sandy, who is kind only to her sweet, mentally handicapped brother, Jimmy Vandevyver. After a class on sexual abuse from feminist teacher Lydia De Beule, Sandy pretends Rob abused her. Lydia, Rob's ex, eagerly helps her fabricate 'proof', which a female police commissioner eagerly believes. A frustrated judge (and father) shamelessly ignores the legal benefit of the doubt, even tricks Rob while in jail. Nelle discovers more then one sick truth.","popularity":2.896,"poster_path":"/wbyIdnbD3gXlEI6ToZK45G5NR2d.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"No evidence, no crime","title":"Suspect","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
