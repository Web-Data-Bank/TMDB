It covers his personal journey discovering his roots. Reliving old habits with friends and memories from his childhood, this journey leads him to re-visit his past with his ex-girlfriend, and then with a new friend, Anna, through whom he visits his old home in Gozo, now a neglected house full of memories. Anna is his springboard for self reflection and becomes his reason for trying to start life again in Malta; a place he’s familiar with but is now seeing through different eyes.","popularity":0.655,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":73572,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sekwenza","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MT","name":"Malta"}],"release_date":"2009-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Maltese","iso_639_1":"mt","name":"Malti"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Was, Already","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
