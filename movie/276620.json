Forty-odd \"Skipjacks\" were still used by Maryland watermen to dredge up oysters from the Bay. At that time, the fleet had survived because of a Maryland conservation law which prohibits the use of motor power for oyster dredging. The watermen traditionally marked the opening of each oystering season with a skipjack race which the Maryland State Tourist Board incorporated into its annual \"Chesapeake Bay Appreciation Day.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1968-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Watermen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
