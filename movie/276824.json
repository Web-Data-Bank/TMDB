The tickets to the live event in Los Angeles sold out in 3 hours.  Metamoris is the first submission grappling organization to showcase the world's best athletes in a submission-only format with one round of 20-minutes per match. There is no other way to win a Metamoris fight other than by submitting your opponent (forcing them to tap out), thus the only way to take the belt from a champion within Metamoris is by submission, making Metamoris more entertaining and realistic than traditional point system based grappling events. Win or lose the best only get better.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Rematch","title":"Metamoris 3 - The Rematch","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
