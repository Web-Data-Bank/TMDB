When Orlando enters, he is a man clearly torn between his love of fame and his love for Angelica. \"Orlando teaches all of us that love is often responsible for our loss of reason,\" runs a line from Act 3 of the opera. It is a modest moral, and perhaps one not demanding of the dramatic finesse and musical diversity that Handel serves up in Orlando - for the opera's complex of problems is rather more complicated than that. Beneath the fabric of this masterfully woven constellation of characters and values is a score of such independence and vivacity as to give Orlando a special position among Handel's works - indeed among opera literature in general.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/s45ZeeMXbWAeJAN9d0ZD7qCpWHY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":155,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Orlando","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
