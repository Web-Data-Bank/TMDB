Many jokes include being the first stand-up comedian to perform at the venue and his comparative to other artist's demands when visiting a venue opposed to his demands, to the importance of one's eyes (theme of the show), traditional Puerto Rican remedies, his own mother, television infomercials, marijuana, his fiscal problems with past-due back taxes, and, of course, sex. Marking his last unplanned curtain call in his career, \"Qué OJOnes\" (\"What BIG EYEs!\") was brought to the big screen as an posthumous homage to one of Luis Raúl's final wishes before his death.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":13547,"logo_path":null,"name":"NBTV Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"¡Qué OjOnes!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
