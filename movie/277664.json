This short film walks the viewer through art directors' responsibilities and the demands on their talents. They read a script carefully and design a set to capture the time and place, the social strata, and the mood. They must be scholars of the history of architecture, furnishings, and fashion. They choose the colors on a set in anticipation of the lighting and the mood. Their work also sets styles, from Art Deco in the 20's to 30s modernism. Then it's on to the next project.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/57b5sX4bRqKvkaVBXYL627R2Mpp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":43330,"logo_path":null,"name":"Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1949-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Art Director","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
