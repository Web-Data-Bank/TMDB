They inevitably broaden, as their momentum builds into a celebration of the game itself - its vigour, its humour, its spirit and perhaps above all, its friendships. No-one knows how to celebrate these things better than Max.  Max Boyce holds a unique place in the affections of rugby followers as someone whose love for the game – and for Welsh rugby in particular, however it happens to be faring - helps define the kind of entertainer he is and the very special world he invites us to enter.  It’s a world audiences have embraced with total delight over three decades of best-selling albums, hit television shows and sell-out live performances. You name it and Max has done it. Now he can add the Sydney Opera House to his list of conquests.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"2003 concert from the Sydney Opera House, Australia","title":"Max Boyce Down Under","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
