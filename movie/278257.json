A decade later, Farah is a successful photographer, Hamidah is an entertainment magazine columnist, Husin has become a cameraman and Adam is a music tutor. A comedy of errors follow when the bunch, who each has personal problems, meet in Pulau Langkawi. Farah’s busy schedule does not permit her to fall in love, though she is acquainted with Halim, a bright but bumbling lawyer. Then there’s Husin who has sacrificed much while taking care of his paralysed mother. Hamidah, on the other hand, has long fancied Husin, and dresses to kill for the reunion and does everything she can to attract his attention. As for Adam, he has a jealous girlfriend in Aleya who is envious of the close ties between her beau and Farah, though the duo’s relationship is purely platonic.","popularity":0.991,"poster_path":"/eidVzZXeaO1TxRpyw77jVjZHtBF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malay","iso_639_1":"ms","name":"Bahasa melayu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cinta Luar Biasa","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
