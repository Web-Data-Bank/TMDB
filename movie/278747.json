In the form of a docu-fiction, the events of the long occupation are reconstructed, which began on June 4, 1967 and ended in December 1968. The workers play themselves and various other roles, but they are also co-authors of the film, which is not a simple chronicle of events, but an analytical reading of the reality of the factory, the story of the conquest of instruments of struggle and democracy, with the indication of strategies of attack on the bosses' power. The narrative voice of Gian Maria Volont√© gives continuity to the story and comments on the events.","popularity":0.877,"poster_path":"/i335PhzGBjuiPXofM980GrU74D6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114347,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cine Giornale Libero","origin_country":""},{"id":114348,"logo_path":null,"name":"Comitato di Occupazione dell'Apollon","origin_country":""},{"id":85359,"logo_path":null,"name":"Unitelefilm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1969-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Apollon: una fabbrica occupata","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
