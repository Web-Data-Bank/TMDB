George soon decides that a very immediate remedy would be to kill off his wife, collect the insurance money, and celebrate a new unencumbered debt free life. However, God is watching, and in a surprising turn of events George mistakenly ends up killing himself. He subsequently wakes up trapped 24/7 in a purgatory world especially arranged just for him known as, Dollgatory. In order to be granted redemption and escape Dollgatory, George must convince his outlandish set of past customers (who are all out to destroy him), to renew their faith in God. Will George ever successfully pass his judgment day with God, or remain a prisoner in Dollgatory for eternity, only the viewer knows the final answer!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1I27kK8XvFxKEIO2EcF139eXpb1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Everything for a Buck or More!","title":"Dollgatory","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":2}
