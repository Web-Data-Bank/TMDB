In celebration of both music and images, the Houston Symphony has commissioned a high definition visual presentation to accompany the live performance of \"The Planets\". Produced by celebrated filmmaker Duncan Copp, \"The Planets - An HD Odyssey\" beautifully marries the latest images returned from planetary spacecraft with Holst's music to provide a mesmerizing spectacle. Disc one contains the film accompanied by a newly recorded soundtrack by the Houston Symphony and the Women of the Houston Symphony Chorus. Disc two contains a behind- the- scenes, making of documentary with an in- depth interview with Music Director Hans Graf and interviews with leading planetary scientists.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":122,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"featuring Hans Graf and the Houston Symphony Orchestra","title":"The Planets: An HD Odyssey","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
