Returning to his native Liverpool, Martin pulls together a backing band of misfits and loners, and recruits his ex-girlfriend Joan (Lisa Stansfield) as a singer. Things are complicated somewhat by the fact that Joan is now married to the policeman who arrested Martin, and when the band's first gig - at a heavy metal pub - goes badly, it seems as though the road to musical success may be a rocky one.","popularity":1.375,"poster_path":"/tV4B1sntwK2T8C2cttioMvOWFy1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Getting this dream off the ground is going to require some very fancy footwork!!","title":"Swing","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
