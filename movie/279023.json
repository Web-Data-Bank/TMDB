The documentary looks at Tokyo's music culture as a reflection of Japanese society and in relation to international music culture. Tokyo's reputation for an overwhelming variety of global information, media-saturated urban environment and cutting edge innovation, makes it the perfect sample for addressing a new outlook on music culture as it explores this eccentric music culture set within a modern Japanese megalopolis.","popularity":0.957,"poster_path":"/ut8Q8UVUsPKF55mLPlfU64c0Iwu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Live from Tokyo","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
