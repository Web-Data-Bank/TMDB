It takes the viewer to the early Edison days when moving images of a man walking or sneezing were a novelty. Schwartz combines those historical sequences with contemporary animation to comment on the progress of movie-making in the twentieth century. This \"how-to animation\" with its \"tongue-in-cheek\" mix of live action, animation and xerography serves as an introduction to the concept of structuralism.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2UHIagrUoWUC9JILlklMbhP2ZQQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Animus","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
