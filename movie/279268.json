For one thing, she has albinism - a lack of pigment in the skin, hair and eyes - and her appearance has provoked prejudice from family, friends and strangers since she was born. But despite all odds, Agnes refuses to lead a life of sorrow. This fascinating and inspiring documentary also shares the stories of seven other people's individual experiences of living their lives with albinism in Kenya, a predominantly black society. While each person's story is unique, they all have one thing in common: they know what it is like to stand out uncomfortably from the crowd.","popularity":0.622,"poster_path":"/nZHCLXNxXbCt5oxenVsiU4fBoQx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KE","name":"Kenya"}],"release_date":"2009-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Swahili","iso_639_1":"sw","name":"Kiswahili"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What is it like to be 'white' in a 'black' society?","title":"In My Genes","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
