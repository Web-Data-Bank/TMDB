Eggert’s direction of the movie is as odd as the plot. The whole film is unsettling.  The titles are too long; there are interminable shots of irrelevant action; the cutting is uneven. The heroine is unsuitably comic, spasmodically jumping around, smearing ink on her face, knocking things over.  For some reason the somber, doomed count falls in love with this girl and decides to marry her.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xDYji3wUCXg8beiYOTG9Pw7WfJR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6507,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mezhrabpom-Rus","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1925-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Bear's Wedding","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
