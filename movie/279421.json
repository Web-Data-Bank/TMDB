However, this programme is not so easily dismissed. There might be nothing new here, but there is no doubt that a great deal of Conley's success comes from her ability to motivate. Conley first runs through the key moves featured in the work-outs, cleverly eliminating the problem of figuring it out during the sessions--and the risk of giving up. The 35-minute aerobic workout and the 20-minute body conditioning session are designed to be done on alternative days, while the final chair programme is for those with limited mobility (including pregnant women) who still want to burn calories.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":26335,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vci","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2003-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ultimate Whole Body Workout","video":true,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
