He drives a semi, plays the guitar and raps. Sandman looks like Woody Guthrie but sings like LL Cool J. Roll Out, Cowboy follows the 39-year-old country/hip-hop musician as he tours the American West, performing for rural towns who might not have heard hip-hop before. We witness bank break-ups and town groupies: even a brief flirtation with truck-driving. Sandman's story is the struggle of an artist trying to make a buck. In a tough economy, can your American dream still carry a tune?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Roll Out, Cowboy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
