The Unlight enemy forced the first exodus to the moon where the outlawed banished population was supposed to die. But now the Unlights have launched from Earth and are amassing on the south-west sector of the darkside of the moon for a massive ice-mining operation. It will be the last Great War and lunar troops are sent into battle for the precious resource. However one squad is shot down and the five surviving soldiers find themselves stranded. Cut off and behind enemy lines, they start a dangerous journey through snipers and minefields back to their extraction point with only 36 hours of oxygen left. As their numbers dwindle and nerves fray, they make an amazing discovery about Earth’s satellite that just might save their lives. From THE BANSHEE CHAPTER producers comes a space shocker with gravity.","popularity":2.534,"poster_path":"/vR6KqoDWFnXXb9dTLF3QddCAsgC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77029,"logo_path":null,"name":"Red Giant Media","origin_country":""},{"id":19601,"logo_path":null,"name":"Favorit Film","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":77028,"logo_path":"/4d2dzq45lPrCJLZhWdh9BCT1LnY.png","name":"Pipeline Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-08-22","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shockwave Darkside","video":false,"vote_average":1.3,"vote_count":6}
