It's a world of circles - often seen from above: an espresso cup, a stairwell, the pills, and the records spinning. At the dance where the music plays, the rhythms evoke images of a butcher slicing head cheese, gears driving other wheels and levers, a combine churning out bales of hay, a butcher cutting chunks of meat for a stew, and boxers punching. The circle of music and life.","popularity":0.94,"poster_path":"/8vFDcCmYSP87Y2CvIy4lp4eQ7T3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2329,"logo_path":null,"name":"Krátký film Praha","origin_country":"XC"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","name":"Czechoslovakia"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Disc Jockey","video":false,"vote_average":5.688,"vote_count":16}
