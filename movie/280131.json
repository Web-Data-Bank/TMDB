In a world run by youth, primal attributes dictate who is 'King of the Classroom'. When Marty, a troubled but talented teenager, moves into the locker beside his school's 'Classroom King', a charismatic but grossly sadistic cocaine dealer, his position on the high school food chain sinks to an unsurpassed low. Marty is forced to make the decision of his life: put up with the savage humiliation, or respond with the same primal attitude he is attacked with. His choices slowly but surely reveal who is Class Savage.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":26605,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nostra Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2008-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Class Savage","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
