It's Daisy Duck's birthday, and, in preparation, Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck have arranged a surprise party and bought a cuckoo clock as a present. However, the bird inside the clock escapes, leading Donald and Mickey into a strange fantasy world, modeled after Lewis Carroll's Wonderland. Some friends tag along for the journey, and some even appear as characters from the original tale. Goofy becomes the Goofy Hatter and Clarabelle Cow becomes Queen Clarabelle.","popularity":3.925,"poster_path":"/gmRb7sEuhSaZHZlfuPR4azETjzw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3475,"logo_path":"/jTPNzDEn7eHmp3nEXEEtkHm6jLg.png","name":"Disney Television Animation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mickey Mouse Clubhouse: Mickey's Adventures in Wonderland","video":true,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":7}
