Eastman and Laird's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles presented a completely original breed of super hero. It was too bizarre, too crazy. It broke all the rules and should never have worked. Until it sold out. Again and again and again. For 30 years. Now, peek under the shell and see how this so-called \"happy accident\" defied every naysayer to become one of the most popular and beloved franchises in the world.","popularity":2.454,"poster_path":"/8O4Y6fNxHaHwiI8SQpQekCJlnfz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29923,"logo_path":null,"name":"FauxPop Media","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":30900,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mirage Studios","origin_country":"US"},{"id":149751,"logo_path":null,"name":"iProductions","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Look Under The Shell","title":"Turtle Power: The Definitive History of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles","video":false,"vote_average":7.476,"vote_count":21}
