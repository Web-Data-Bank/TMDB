He has never known him, because the brother emigrated illegally in the U.S.A. years before.  Upon his arrival in America, he is greeted with much respect, as well as his brother, also from the Italian-American community of Little Italy. Enthusiastic of that, he decided to stay on as assistant pastor in the church of Saint Lucia and bring it to a new shine.  Accompanied in New York, his last name, Anastasia, commands respect and, above all, opens the door hitherto locked: his brother, really, is the infamous mob boss Albert Anastasia.","popularity":0.722,"poster_path":"/xF34avlkJ11PKeFE98olEPOXme6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1735,"logo_path":null,"name":"Documento Film","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1973-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Brother Anastasia","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1}
