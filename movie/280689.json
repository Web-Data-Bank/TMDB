The making of MENI consisted of an obsessive unraveling of a series of dance movements. The movements were cut into very short fragments (0.5 to 1.5 seconds). These fragments are edited into repeating patterns. Through exchanging fragments and double exposure the film becomes an intriguing and complex rhythm.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8gYzBSXckROuJMntWzEzAvkqo9Z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meni","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
