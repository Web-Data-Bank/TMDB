The central idea of this short experimental film is the practise and significance of wig-wearing in Nollywood film; a practise the director has invested with deeper psychological as well as science-fiction layers. Underpinning this central idea however is a critique of the unforgiving treatment of single women in Nollywood and Nigeria. The film is an example of what the director, Zina Saro-Wiwa, has termed “alt-Nollywood”, a genre that plays with and reworks certain narrative, stylistic and visual conventions of Nollywood. Phyllis explores the gothic possibilities of the Nollywood aesthetic creating a new kind of low-budget atmospheric film that is very much of Nollywood and yet subverts the genre. Using Nollywood to subvert Nollywood.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":72563,"logo_path":null,"name":"ZSW Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NG","name":"Nigeria"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2011-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Phyllis","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
