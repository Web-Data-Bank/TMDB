She works for a large pharmaceutical company that’s just been accused of illegal human testing. Jody has been tasked with putting a major press conference where the company will deny these claims. Stressed out, she decides to blow off some steam by finally meeting up with a guy she’s been chatting with online. She and Dom (Richard Gutierrez) hit it off, and decide to spend the night together at a hotel. Jody wakes up drugged, however, with a bomb strapped to her torso. Dom tells Jody to set off the bomb at the press conference, or harm will come to her family.","popularity":0.807,"poster_path":"/x4AaJx1YIM6male90YYzekSHukg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8237,"logo_path":"/8GxGenlMmEDS1Z6vmZA5PDqA3p6.png","name":"GMA Pictures","origin_country":"PH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2014-07-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Overtime","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
