In 'Extreme Machines' he travels faster, higher and harder than he's ever been before as he investigates the Apache gunship, drives jet boats, looks at a Swedish Stealth Battleship, rides snowmobiles, goes P-51 Mustang racing and gets to fly in an F-16. The series of 'Motorworld' looks at what makes a country tick. It studies why Italians are passionate, Indians crash so often, how the Cubans make brake fluid and much more. In 'Speed' Jeremy is rocketed into the adrenaline-pumping world of fast machines in the most exciting highlights from his TV series in which he sets out to explore both what compels us to pursue these limits - often at considerable risk to our own safety - and what effect the quest has on us.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3aZjZlR01MRXoxfrUshTUM5v9zP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Very Best Of Speed & Motorworld Plus Extreme Machines","title":"The Jeremy Clarkson Collection","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
