When all four are rejected, they hit the road on bad-ass motorcycles, bound for glory in New York City. But when a run-in with a gang of Elvises ends in murder, they find themselves taken prisoner in a little town called Jackville - where folk don't take kindly to blasphemers. The Jesuses fall prey to an evil conspiracy that can only lead to the Apocalypse.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hshvQD8TbxYEr3RaMvnAKVKABH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gory Gory Hallelujah","video":false,"vote_average":2.3,"vote_count":4}
