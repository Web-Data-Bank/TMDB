Filmed over the Summer of 2013, a climatic point in this particular music scene's trajectory, we are given the opportunity to elegantly lift the veil on the personal creative processes of the internationally-acclaimed pillars of the scene. Indie music luminaries such as Flying Lotus, Thundercat, Gaslamp Killer, Daedelus, Nosaj Thing, Ras G, Teebs, D-Styles, TOKiMONSTA and Matthewdavid are all featured in vivid detail. The soundtrack for the film creates itself live on camera as the film elapses. This avant-garde visual angle on each subject in their respective creative spaces provides for an introspective glimpse into what would otherwise be unseen.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wlW9a7qmLvSOBfue2c0tFmLsB3M.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Looking for the Perfect Beat","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
