The effect of the changing economy and politics on the city and its inhabitants is echoed through their physical relocation to its outer edges. In 1990, squatters proclaim a socialist republic on the death strip. Eight years later, the new headquarters of Mercedes Benz are built in the same location. The film makes use of slow super-impositions to uncover a journey across changing architectural and cultural boundaries. \"The Empty Centre\" tries to give a voice and a history to those who continue to be marginalised by the simultaneous dismantling and reconstruction of the borders which they are trying to cross.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/c3CCI84RRWL0qAEHuexsda9VJc3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Empty Center","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
