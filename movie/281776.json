For a film whose title describes the relatively simple mechanism used to create it, Gradual Speed ushers a series of startling transfigurations which brilliantly engage with the extended time spent with people, animals, events and objects in whose company the filmmaker sketches larger concerns of love, fixity, representation and loss.” — Julie Murray","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/l92bpEblEg3f89nbrRK4x963TSo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2013-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gradual Speed","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
