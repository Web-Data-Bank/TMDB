As they navigate their respective addictions, each comes close to overdosing just before they're evicted from their apartment.","popularity":0.711,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Foo-Foo Dust","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":4}
