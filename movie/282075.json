The hero of this film is a female spy, an acrobatic Mata-Hari, played by his favorite actress, Josette Andriot, who wore a characteristic costume of a close-fitting black jersey, two years before Musidora achieved cult status with her similar appearance as Irma Vep. This final masterpiece reflects Jasset's popular style: rhythmic action, fantastic realism, rich visuals, an anarchistic philosophy, a disdain for psychology, and an attention to lighting that earned him the nickname “the Rembrandt of the cinema\". Although Jasset died shortly after completion, the film had considerable success and Andriot went on to make four more films in the series with other directors.","popularity":0.863,"poster_path":"/eMw22Egi0WkPbmYJY0HHXuyHbZe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24092,"logo_path":null,"name":"Société Française des Films Éclair","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1913-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Protéa","video":false,"vote_average":4.75,"vote_count":8}
