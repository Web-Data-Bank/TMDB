It shows us how Parisians of the 1920s spent their Sundays, by following the progress of four young people on their day off - a girl, her beau, and his two rivals. The film is at turns comic, wistful and romantic.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":27876,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Andr√© Ghilbert","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1929-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rayon de soleil","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
