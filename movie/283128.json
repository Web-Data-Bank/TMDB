However, family friend Untung (played by Mat Sentol) desires to take Zaleha as his second wife and conspires with the nosy matchmaker Mak Andam to concoct a scandalous love affair that Zaleha had before marriage. Zaki chances upon the fabricated proof on the wedding night and believes Zaleha to be tainted. He self-righteously insults his newly wedded wife and distances away from her, much to the confusion and annoyance of their families, as Zaki is suspected to be impotent.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nBSiBO0VIdaLSVFOKPMjGQNdqY2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":87061,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cathay-Keris Films","origin_country":"SG"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"1966-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malay","iso_639_1":"ms","name":"Bahasa melayu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anak Dara","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
