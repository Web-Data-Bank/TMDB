Something that looks like a rabbit is not necessarily a rabbit. When a straight couple appears, people often consider them to be ordinary heterosexuals. And when two gay people get together, people simply think of them as homosexuals. In this instinctive view, which holds that people are either homo or hetero, bisexuals seem to fade out. This film is a real reflection of the lives of bisexual people in Taiwan. We hope that through the film, people can understand more about bisexuals.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eysjCkYzSJYmc5EnRYicuidDEpV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2013-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To Live Invisibly","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
