People meet and leave, and wonder, will they find themselves again? At daybreak, Serge believes he has committed a crime. Pietra realises that she has been betrayed around midday. At one o’clock 8-year-old Vlad feels lovesick for the first time. The day is spent observing, looking, avoiding and meeting each other. One day, three different perspectives: the same evening twilight, the same loneliness. And there is always the stranger who crosses their path. How will Serge, Pietra and Vlad find each other?","popularity":0.902,"poster_path":"/1bYZTdvta8091K2LVNLvE0FOZ75.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4491,"logo_path":null,"name":"Avventura Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":8138,"logo_path":"/4P6c8TiJZhL2z7b0LbPOUTZwP4z.png","name":"Vega Film","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":729,"logo_path":"/hNxGdbddbsDDnEWJ7RNLcGCRSLQ.png","name":"Why Not Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"That Day","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
