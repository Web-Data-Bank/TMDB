It is laughably cheap. The only things added are some subtitles, dubing, and music. Made up from such fine films as \"Assault of the Killer Bimbos\". They are stringed together to form a \"plot\" about aliens. Lots of pointless nudity, but it is somewhat well-paced. Stay for the final credits, which the narrator narrates.","popularity":1.514,"poster_path":"/zCJFIbaPllXv2ys2YjZDw0zkXvf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A squadron of outer space bimbos decide to take revenge on the male chauvinists of Earth.","title":"Bimbo Movie Bash","video":false,"vote_average":2.7,"vote_count":7}
