He knows Victor had an affair with his mother and may even be his dad. Working for iron-fisted Victor is back-breaking, but his existence is softened by the presence of a curious girl living in the downstairs flat. As he falls in love with her, he realises she not only has an aversion to restaurants, but food of all kinds. Is her eating disorder a force too resilient for anything, even love to cure?","popularity":2.745,"poster_path":"/8LGX4DRcv34BbgOTCTvwUK4K1UP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28416,"logo_path":null,"name":"4P Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Delicious","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":13}
