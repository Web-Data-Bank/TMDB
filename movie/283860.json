She comes down to Earth from her home in outer space to help solve the relationship problems of people. Her first assignment involves foiling a perfect murder and a bit of gender-bending as she tries to help Tanaka revive the life of his dream lover and get revenge on the killer, which was her ex-girlfriend. The second assignment involves pulling a sexually frustrated teenager's spirit out of a video game after the stress of being dumped forced it outside the body.","popularity":0.62,"poster_path":"/peRdwycZnn0j1q2ryEHnz7ax8UD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20336,"logo_path":null,"name":"PinkPineapple","origin_country":""},{"id":3560,"logo_path":"/yOsrKcVSpC9ofAkE6hJjvC8sW9u.png","name":"KSS","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":4690,"logo_path":"/bQXkraSwoBDVd8xEAOkxGQLBB1S.png","name":"Anime International Company","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rei Rei","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":1}
