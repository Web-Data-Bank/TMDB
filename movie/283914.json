The classics, for the one you love UFO today but all were already published that have not yet reached a little more focused on more pop songs phase of the early eighties, and then Englishman present in this WDR Rockpalast recording in very good shape and as a bone-dry , no-frills hard rock band, impressed their game and songwriting even 30 years later.  Especially the hits \"Lights out\", \"rock bottom\" and \"Doctor, Doctor\" ensure goosebumps. Sound and image (of course 4:3) in public service TV quality guarantee best entertainment, and only the lean Ausstatttung is somewhat disappointing: Were there no interviews, no backstage footage? An excellent live document of an exceptional band.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hAW2RY4YWeytj9bGk8huUzdPPH8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"UFO: Rockpalast 1980","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
