Golovkin is the kind of brutal power puncher that fans gravitate towards, and his incredible string of KOs on HBO has earned him a great following. With that, HBO hopes to build him up as a future megastar in the looming post-Mayweather, post-Pacquiao era. But Geale is a talented fighter who should make this a scrap. Add in the Madison Square Garden crowd and you have the recipe for an exciting night of action.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oKsbn1kjndEmjFjzTH4aqPpFkGL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-07-26","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gennady Golovkin vs. Daniel Geale","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":2}
