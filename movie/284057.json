Based on the myth from Ovid's Metamorphoses in which Acteón accidentally catches a glimpse of Diana, the goddess of love, and is subsequently turned into a deer for his dogs to devour, Jorge Grau's modernist retelling resets the story to contemporary Spain, where a fisherman – played by Martin LaSalle, star of Bresson's Pickpocket – follows an enchanting, flirtatious stranger into the city.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iFsSQZhwNxAD55Vd8hUv8Yfq709.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34885,"logo_path":null,"name":"X Films","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1967-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Acteón","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4}
