He just bought the lottery ticket to keep the peace with his lotto-enthusiastic co-workers. Eventually, he's forced to think about what to do with such a big win, when his ticket hits the jackpot. And he soon realizes, that he is the only one not having an answer to that question. His wife Susanne already knows what to do with their new found wealth. His son Lutz also makes plans. The shock-wave of this \"lottobomb\" tears Torsten's orderly world apart and leaves him with the question of who he really is.","popularity":0.631,"poster_path":"/dWD7fIdENGbsk6cH8o2YrXlxV2X.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16052,"logo_path":"/zuTtCXQa9NWiUnydXdpNIr9DDcn.png","name":"Cine Plus Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2013-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Millionen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
