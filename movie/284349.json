Persecutions, arrests, killings, kidnappings. The film Seventy rejoins 18 characters of this story, forty years later. The film mixes the excitement of revisiting the past with a vision, sometimes even good humored of everything they lived. Many years afterwards they relive their experience of pain, violence and survival, of rebuilding their own story and continuing to believe in the possibility of improving the world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":30883,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cavídeo Produções","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":13969,"logo_path":"/bEpiJ2zXGIH70JT16asjWNFtOEv.png","name":"Globo Filmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2013-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seventy","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3}
