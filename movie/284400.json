Examined closely, Wayne's life is a startling series of contradictions. He was a member of his high school's Shakespeare club who began his career by acting in scores of B-grade Westerns, and though he avoided military service, he was considered an American hero. Filled with well-chosen archival stills, as well as seldom-seen early clips, this video also features interviews with fellow actors Charlton Heston and Ron Howard, as well as writer and scholar Garry Wills (author of a brilliant intellectual study of Wayne's work and life, John Wayne's America).","popularity":0.681,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"JOHN WAYNE - AMERICAN LEGEND","video":true,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":3}
