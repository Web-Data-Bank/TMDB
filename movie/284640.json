But the executive power over the whole administration was vested on the Prime Minister. Owing to the presence of a large body of princes, each of whom was a positive material for insurrection, no king could sit on the throne safely. The Prime Minister, therefore, instituted search for the suitors to capture and kill them, or let off after mutilating thereby banning them for succession. The principal target of massacre was Godapani, a man of personal - vigor and energy. But Godapani became aware of The Prime Minister's design and fled to the Naga hills. Unable to trace Godapani, the army led by, one Gathi Hazarika, came upon his wife Joymoti. Gathi inflicted tortures on her to elicit the much sought-after information. She stuck to plea of ignorance, and replied to the increasing tortures by silence and patience. She breathed her last in the midst of torture.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4yNF5yVMNuclp6HDzDl4Yf2K3zG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134969,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chitralekha Movietone","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1935-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Assamese","iso_639_1":"as","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Joymoti","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
