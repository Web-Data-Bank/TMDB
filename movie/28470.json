Bockerer and his wife Binerl have survived the war, though his butcher's shop was destroyed by bombs. Karl Bockerer opens up a new establishment in the center of the city.  Post-war Vienna is divided into four zones in which the Allies run things and ensure that law and order prevails. This is the story of two lovers: Gustl, just returned form a POW camp, and the Russian interpreter Elena. Bockerer becomes the patron of their love. Elena's father was executed by Stalin, and the only way she can escape a similar fate is to marry an Austrian. Bockerer \"buys\" a husband for Elena and, full of tricks as ever, he succeeds in pulling the wool over the Russian occupier's eyes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2cI9w0q9PKwaNfTfIeRUYCyXlkE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1833,"logo_path":"/uwoSxaCjO4Ls5yUXgvny9ydFJxf.png","name":"Epo-Film","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":1541,"logo_path":null,"name":"Terra Film Group","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1996-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der Bockerer II - Österreich ist frei","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":9}
