Once the writer has knowledge of this elixir, called 'Mafussalin', the group of five immortals give him a stark choice: either join them, with the price of admission, being a duel to the death between the immortal who accidentally gave the secret away or death at the hands of the group. As the writer makes up his mind, sometimes aided and at other times opposed by the ever shifting alliances from within the group, we discover how the other immortals became this way, their true ages and what they have done with this 'gift'.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jDMMPTpWzrqZUGyHPmTU6OF4aSI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24737,"logo_path":"/8HNAhlCnXm0svEf2Glrzgdc7k61.png","name":"Laterna Film","origin_country":""},{"id":25606,"logo_path":"/eSlqpXsyQW7u059lOnSsXtUakLl.png","name":"Gosfilmfond Russia","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1990-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Temptation of B.","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":8}
