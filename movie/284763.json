Rising to fame as frontman of ‘70s legends The Sports, he has spent more than 30 years at the forefront of the local music scene, forging a reputation both as one of Australian rock's greatest lyrical storytellers and also one of its most incendiary critics. Based on his scathing tell-all memoir Will It Be Funny Tomorrow, Billy?, Don't Throw Stones tells Cummings' story in his own words – as well as the words of those he has so gleefully skewered. Featuring interviews with Michael Gudinski, Steve Kilbey, Joe Camilleri and many more, Don't Throw Stones is a revealing portrait of three decades of rock-world gossip, larger-than-life personalities and good, old-fashioned artistic beef.","popularity":0.655,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":28876,"logo_path":null,"name":"Emptybrook Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2014-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"Music is a way of remembering, and I guess we all remember differently.\" – Stephen Cummings","title":"Don't Throw Stones","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":2}
