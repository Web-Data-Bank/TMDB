She is assigned to a special class for disabled pupils who have to present themselves before a school commission at the end of the year in order to prove that they merit being moved back into a \"normal\" class. Her enervated teachers, however, show absolutely no desire to motivate the students and help them improve; on the contrary, they try to quash right from the start any interest Lena shows in more complex study material. Nevertheless, Lena soon involves herself in the school routine and gets together with classmate Anton. Yet their transparent happiness is not to everyone's liking and repercussions soon follow.","popularity":2.749,"poster_path":"/tibX6dnumNTiQOubbaviD7FJ5Zc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20490,"logo_path":null,"name":"New People Film Company","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2014-09-25","revenue":156888,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Corrections Class","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":38}
