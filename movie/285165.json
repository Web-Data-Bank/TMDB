Beatles relates the story of four Oslo boys born in 1951 and hooked on The Beatles, from the time they as seventh graders find themselves on the threshold of the adult world. The film is all about boyish pranks, hopes, disappointments, and of course about pretty girls, hopeless infatuations, drunkenness and parties. The world is changing, and so is the friendship between the boys. But the conclusion is, true friendship endures all - and no band in the world is better than The Beatles.","popularity":1.295,"poster_path":"/90nX6Kcfczk21hCWW1Zwm5VsJT9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":67997,"logo_path":"/iqRvctSbqCVRLW53of9yYUUgLDa.png","name":"Storm Rosenberg","origin_country":"NO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2014-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beatles","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":15}
