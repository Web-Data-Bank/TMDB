Dissolution 1","overview":"Structural Filmwaste. Dissolution 2 is the continuation of investigations into the fragmentation of time and images through video. It also represents an attempt to reveal the material nature of this vehicle of illusions. Depictions of a film strip (with sprocket holes, frame lines, splices, etc.) were reduced to horizontal and vertical lines with a resolution comparable to that of video. The image itself comprises two different temporal structures which are interlaced in the alternation between the half images.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lmMIVwOpCgilBlsGZHBdUN0BiHH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2003-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Structural Filmwaste.
