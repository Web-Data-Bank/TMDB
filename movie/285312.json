So it didn’t come out as a surprise to anyone, when, one fateful day, the precocious little boy went into a mad frenzy over the prospect of, finally, landing the, much-coveted, love-of-his-life. or a poor boy who only yearned for one thing - and nothing more, in his life, this  break was, without a doubt, the answer to all of his prayers.

It was harder than he thought.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gdxl9KVd4cBbBVCsgfS3eCYpqyV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Andong","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
