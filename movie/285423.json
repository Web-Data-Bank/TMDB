While driving through the hostile Helmand province, a Navy SEAL flags down their convoy and enlists the unit on an operation of international importance: they must help an Afghan woman famous for her defiance of the Taliban escape the country. Without tanks or air support, Merrimette and his team will need all the courage and firepower they can muster to fight their way across the war-torn country and shepherd the woman to safety.","popularity":13.715,"poster_path":"/s3LkjkwmmhECqQyCuJLG1t009Qq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7188,"logo_path":"/4lh5AHeYmjH0EITJLnWNbvu6PI0.png","name":"UFO International Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":17009,"logo_path":"/ssowAxOrrqsSR2CKeiytOXwLoCW.png","name":"Universal 1440 Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":1522,"logo_path":"/8uaoEVgNxFH0R94O53gUiByahVr.png","name":"Neal Street Productions","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":780,"logo_path":null,"name":"Red Wagon Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Find the courage, fight together.","title":"Jarhead 2: Field of Fire","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":253}
