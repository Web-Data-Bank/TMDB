It's a comedy-drame chronicling the ups and downs in the relationship of an unmarried couple (Adriana Altaras, Vladimir Weigl). When she tries to persuade him that they should have a child, he escapes the controversy by becoming preoccupied with his new aquarium and microscope. Their struggles to settle their differences and accept new responsibilities are presented intelligently, realistically and with low-key wit and irony.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9jGPWfEcg9BhlqKPVEQNJ24NUb1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29188,"logo_path":null,"name":"Moana-Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1988-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Microscope","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":4}
