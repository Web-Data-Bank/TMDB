After applying for a green card for Tony based on their marriage, the couple received a denial letter from the Immigration and Naturalization Service stating, 'You have failed to establish that a bona fide marital relationship can exist between two faggots.' Outraged at this letter, and to prevent Tony's impending deportation, the couple sued the U.S. government, filing the first federal lawsuit seeking equal treatment for a same-sex marriage in U.S. history. This tenacious story of love, marriage and immigration equality is as precedent setting as it is little known... until now.","popularity":1.277,"poster_path":"/kgGcedjBuEVUTf18BFQvexiXmg0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Love Story That Defined A Movement","title":"Limited Partnership","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":4}
