The Takarazuka Revue is an enormously successful spectacular where the all-women cast create fantasies of erotic love and sensitive men. It is also a world for young girls desperate to do something different with their lives. In return for living a highly disciplined and reclusive existence, they will be adored and envied by many thousands of Japanese women. They will look, act and behave like young men while having no real men in their lives. Dream Girls explores the nature of sexual identity and the contradictory tensions that face young women in Japan today.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-08-17","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dream Girls","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
