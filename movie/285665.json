His method is to follow hidden clues in this house and to respond to the hidden aids in his memory.  Back and forth, between inquisition and logic, he constructs a search with two unknowns – ‘What it is’ and ‘Where it is’. Each object he chooses has multiple functions, which extend both into the physical space of his search, and into the imaginary world of his perception and memory.”  E.B. 1980","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9UNnVQs5AkC03kxggW5kmAekDJH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Out of Hand","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
