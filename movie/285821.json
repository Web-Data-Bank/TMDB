Halimah is a wife who is taken for granted by her husband who is pro-Dutch. Hamid is the son of a rich merchant who falls into poverty after being branded as a rebel. His mother takes him to Padang to be raised by the family of Haji Jakfar, who has a daughter, Zainab. Hamid then studies at Padang Panjang and meets old friends, Fakhrudin and Zainudin. Hamid and Fakhrudin have more similar views with their teacher, while Zainudin is more radical. The latter organises a rebellion and fails. The Dutch keeps arresting people. Hamid, disappointed by Zainab’s marriage to someone else, sails to Mecca. Halimah is left to organise the fight for freedom but in the end, is also captured by the Dutch. The film’s message is that a physical fight for freedom, without being based on religious morality, will become meaningless.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5Vnr5QYFfpjeOoYY1IAMcLUp4tu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Independence Pioneers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
