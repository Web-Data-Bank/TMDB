In 2014, following the release of their latest album Indie Cindie, they are bringing their roaring guitars and stop-start dynamics to the Other Stage. They come armed with an impressive back catalogue of intertwining male-female harmonies, expressive, cryptic lyrics and punk-rock-surf riffs.  Pixies made a strong bond with the BBC in 1998 when they released the Peel-session compilation Pixies at the BBC in 1998. The compilation was recorded over several sessions between 1988 and 1991 at the BBC. The album is characterized by its raw, under-produced sound.  One of the most influential American alternative rock bands of the late '80s, Pixies have been through various line-up break-ups and make-ups but they will stand united for Glastonbury this year!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pixies Live at Glastonbury 2014","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
