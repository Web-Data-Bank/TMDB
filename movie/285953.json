Lonely, lovelorn, weary or cynical, the characters drift in and out of the bar and each other's lives, giving voice to Saroyan's philosophies as they randomly comment about the impending world war, the beauty of art, and traditional notions of good and evil. At least one of the relationships stands a chance of enduring: a brawny innocent named Tom is falling in love with a vulnerable young prostitute named Kitty. Saroyan himself is heard reciting the play's prologue.","popularity":1.414,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":15704,"logo_path":null,"name":"Insight Media","origin_country":"US"},{"id":15702,"logo_path":null,"name":"Broadway Theatre Archive","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1976-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Time of Your Life","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
