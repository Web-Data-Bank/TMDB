Meanwhile, the townsfolk, led by a Stanley-costumed Mater, enjoy the planned 'leisurely drive' to retrace Stanley’s original frontier route. Thinking they’re on the same course, a wrong turn sends McQueen and the Baja pros on a treacherously wild bid for survival. The misunderstanding leaves the racing professionals in awe of the 'legend' of Stanley: the Original Off-Road Racer.","popularity":5.948,"poster_path":"/oKuGXTnggOmut8A0ZvU1Hh2yOa8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3,"logo_path":"/1TjvGVDMYsj6JBxOAkUHpPEwLf7.png","name":"Pixar","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-05-20","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Radiator Springs 500½","video":false,"vote_average":6.378,"vote_count":74}
