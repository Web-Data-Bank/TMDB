Transplanted from Chicago to Atlanta, Preach (Crawford) is a talented poet whose inability to get over his fondness for weed or his grief for his late girlfriend Gail inhibits both his writing career and his current relationship with the mature and challenging Arika (Clay). The arrival of a Chicago friend carrying a dangerous secret brings Preach to a crossroads where he must find--or lose--his destiny. As in his previous films, Tyton’s easygoing, actor-friendly approach pays off richly in character authenticity and development.
