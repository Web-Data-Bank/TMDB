The opening political grotesque on the election of the President is drowned out by the ecstatic ramblings of philosophising (and chattering) fragments turning on the sought-out axis of life and the world, and especially the inward-looking images full of colourful objectivity and charming humour that is elevated to the level of pure poetry.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":32930,"logo_path":"/pk1mLuYxSmTWX0BdgzbHdUvRI5u.png","name":"FAMU","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":120811,"logo_path":null,"name":"Théâtre de la Liberté","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2005-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deepsummer Night Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
