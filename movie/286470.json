Led by Virginia, the younger nuns stand up for changing the strict religious dogmas and would like a modern school with genuine science, a bathroom to be built, and a freer spirit. Their candidate is sister Magdolna, who went to secular universities, too. The seminarists, led by Kir√°ly Erzsi, also rebel against the older nuns' strict discipline and the depressed atmosphere of the institution. However, Magdolna does not want to stay involved in the fight because she is deterred by Virginia's sinful attraction towards her and the tools Virginia is using to gain victory at any price.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/oECFmFESMu172pZdXGskdOsMUIR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8100,"logo_path":"/1HuVRo0SYPSzYvduxVf4baaWqOI.png","name":"Mafilm","origin_country":"HU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"1971-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ants' Nest","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":5}
