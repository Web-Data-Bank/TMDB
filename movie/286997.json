Harald, who had recruited them for the trip with false promises, watches unnoticed, but cannot enjoy his success, because there are many people interested in the lucrative business with the girls, who are to be forced into prostitution. After two gangsters shoot the shady Lemaire, who had previously blackmailed Harald, he can return unmolested to Berlin to his compagnon Rolf, but the competition remains on his heels and threatens to disrupt the business.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bx4B5GTaS8Qnh4sv8RaUwuFmTdt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12242,"logo_path":null,"name":"Urania Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1966-07-29","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Black Market of Love","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
