It sends him into a downward spiral of paranoia and doubt as he fumbles his way through the theatre of the absurd that we call life. Using humour and a playful tone, the film examines the fragility of human nature, when our bearings get lost and our imagination takes over, highlighting our common fears, doubts, hopes and resilience.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/eiFXZOoCAvRavyvZk4c6o1mebs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don't Breathe","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
