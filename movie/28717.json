The release consists of a concert DVD, a Blu-ray Disc, and separate two-CD audio set. A \"special edition\" of the CD set includes the concert DVD as well. The DVD does not capture any one show in full, but rather congeals from three different shows at The Point. Selections include fan favorites from the tour, radical \"folk big band\" reinterpretations of the Springsteen canon, and rare songs appearing for the first time on any Springsteen release. Contrarily, a few set list regulars from the tour and shows are omitted.","popularity":1.126,"poster_path":"/dbvBW610Zgvx5qxGiETLXmZMsc6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bruce Springsteen with the Sessions Band: Live in Dublin","video":true,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":7}
