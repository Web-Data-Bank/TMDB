Legislators are calling the shots and putting public schools in an ever-shrinking box. WLCSC Board of School Trustees and Superintendent of Schools, Rocky Killion, want to secure resources and legislative relief necessary to achieve the school district’s mission of creating a world-class educational system for all children. The school district’s strategic plan will introduce a model of education that puts decision making back into the hands of local communities and public school teachers, rather than leaving it in the hands of legislators and ultimately lining the pockets of corporations.","popularity":1.721,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":30197,"logo_path":null,"name":"West Lafayette Schools Education Foundation","origin_country":""},{"id":30196,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jack Klink Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The next great ambition in public education, Rise Above the Mark, aims to make the United States a world leader once again.","title":"Rise Above the Mark","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
