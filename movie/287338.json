Their goal: to establish a successful mechanic's shop to get away from their boring jobs as security guards, their loving yet eccentric and demanding families, and poor standard of living in their village - Pickletons. Their simple task of making the down-payment to the garage owner at the village lime that night is hilariously complicated by Romie's love-life, and Pack's love for cannabis. The complications and laughs multiply as the best friends go to extremes to avoid violent drug men, a charity collector, crazy ex-girlfriends and other wacky villagers.","popularity":0.845,"poster_path":"/2aC3P7JvJmnqP4hy8d6XungmZno.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BB","name":"Barbados"}],"release_date":"2014-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Payday","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
