From Sentinel car park in the north to Bushman’s Nek Border Post in the south it’s roughly 220 kilometres across the main range. A trek that takes a strong hiker anywhere between six to 10 days to complete. Ryan Sandes and Ryno Griesel are planning to run it in less than three days. To rightfully claim the title they have to travel on foot, carrying all their own gear without receiving any form of support along the way. It’s just them against the mountain elements. Against the clock.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Travailen","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
