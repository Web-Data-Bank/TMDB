Young activist Eik Skal√∏e has his entire life turned upside down when he falls head over heels in love with the beautiful peace activist Iben Nagel Rasmussen, and she falls in love with him. But Iben is a child of the times, and freely accepts the order of the day: free love and sex. She renounces personal right of ownership and will not settle for one man when she can have several.

But Eik must accept defeat, and in 1968 he travels without his beloved Itsi Bitsi to Nepal, the Land of Dreams in the East. A journey from which he will never return.","popularity":0.911,"poster_path":"/ceED0VGTiHbktz8ITu1MOCh7pXg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":155,"logo_path":"/cDY49SOQwJixJSMun9Haerx8dAQ.png","name":"Nimbus Film","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2015-02-19","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Itsi Bitsi","video":false,"vote_average":4.4,"vote_count":7}
