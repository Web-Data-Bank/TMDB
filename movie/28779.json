Instead of Gepetto, the old-man woodcarver, we have Geppeta, an apparently frustrated and nubile young virgin. Geppeta carves Pinocchio for herself as a gorgeous young hunk. Geppeta's fairy godmother, a blonde played by Dyanne Thorne, magically transforms the young stud Pinocchio into a living man, who is quickly brought to work in the local whorehouse as a prize stud and exhibitionist. Nothing -- not even sex -- is taken seriously in this lighthearted, semi-pornographic offering. The film was originally rated X, but was later re-edited and given an R by the MPAA in 1977","popularity":2.065,"poster_path":"/fJt55LEOLmHT11JiLn9VpyJVLej.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":146053,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pinno Film Company","origin_country":""},{"id":20982,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lima Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's not his nose that grows!","title":"Pinocchio","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":6}
