'Saudade' is the portrait of a threshold: the end of high school, which we experience through Miguel. Set amidst the backdrop of the Ecuadorian economic crisis of 1999, 'Saudade' tackles notions of economic dislocation, friendship, family and young love while juxtaposing the crumbling of Miguel's life, against the crumbling of his country.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1CFSYMfnIB2PoTR67TJashbZm0d.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Saudade","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
