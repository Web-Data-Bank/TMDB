The original screenplay has also been lost. However, some plot descriptions are still known based on contemporary newspaper advertisements of the film.  As the name would indicate, the film tells about two local men who are making moonshine in the woods. A customer comes to them, and while sampling the product they start a game of cards, which eventually leads to a fight. While the fight is going on, the local police shows up and arrests the makers while the customer manages to escape.(Wikipedia)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4GQIIcmW1HqQWvkW58nxx98eBkI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":56799,"logo_path":null,"name":"Atelier Apollo","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"1907-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Salaviinanpolttajat","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
