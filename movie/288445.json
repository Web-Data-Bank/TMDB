Reunited for the first time in over a decade, the sisters take a trip to spread their mother's ashes at a secluded lake. As the sisters reconnect and try to heal old wounds, something waits in the nearby woods. A strange object, made not by the hands of man, beckons them to it. As they begin to try and unlock its secrets, Abby is plagued by nightmares of an alien presence that seem all too real. Little do the sisters realize that this object is actually a device, one with a purpose too horrible to comprehend. As the events of the past and the present begin to merge, new discoveries will threaten to tear apart their newly reformed family, and the inhuman creators of the device will attempt to finish a terrible experiment begun years before.","popularity":3.552,"poster_path":"/699bnacthAhDK5ivneb1PTIc0LB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17840,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ruthless Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":25136,"logo_path":"/uxp09W4ZwJCkxdBZjsz1w55yGLg.png","name":"The October People","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Device","video":false,"vote_average":3.583,"vote_count":36}
