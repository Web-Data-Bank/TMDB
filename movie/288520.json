Very obliquely Rembrandt Laughing sketches the time and place, encompassing the AIDS epidemic, the casual sexual revolution, the debris of '68 lingering in the air. A quiet, very San Francisco comedy of life among a small group of friends. Rembrandt Laughing was improvised over the period of about a month by Jost and his friends, mostly acting non-professionals.","popularity":0.761,"poster_path":"/qaSWnyIa56I6FVYEVDHsmMZGZTX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":119507,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jon Jost Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1989-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rembrandt Laughing","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":5}
