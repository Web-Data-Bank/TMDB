The island lays silently on the margins of geography, entrapped in the footnotes of history, a forgotten place frozen in time.  It was on Herschel Island that a young Inuvialuit boy, Nuligak (later named Bob Cockney by the missionaries) came of age-fascinated by Herschel, but equally repelled by the excess of so-called civilization. Through Nuligak’s touching yet tragic life-story expressed through his writings and echoed by his grandchildren’s poignant return to the Island-we are offered a unique view into an often troubling past and a potentially hopeful future.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":28800,"logo_path":null,"name":"White Pine Pictures","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":76650,"logo_path":null,"name":"Clearwater Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2005-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I, Nuligak : an Inuvialuit history of first contact","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
