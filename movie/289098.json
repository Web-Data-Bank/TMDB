John Bunyan's immortal classic is completed with Christiana, Part 2 of the world-famous book, Pilgrim's Progress. Christiana, who had earlier scoffed at her husband for leaving his family in the City of Destruction, truly repents of her sins. She is rewarded with a glowing faith and leads her daughter, Credence, and sons, Avail and Avow, plus her doubting neighbor, Mercy, towards the Celestial City. With the help of Greatheart, Christiana sets a wonderful example of a loving, but concerned mother who guards and guides her children through numerous dangerous adventures. At Doubting Castle, Mercy at last takes firm grip upon the promises of God's Word and is rewarded with deep faith. Then, at Pilgrim's Rest, the entire group discovers the meaning of the verse, \"For me to live is Christ and to die is to gain.\"","popularity":1.21,"poster_path":"/dc7u1AqxsITQEx8ovxDdHgkXAjg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1979-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Christiana","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
