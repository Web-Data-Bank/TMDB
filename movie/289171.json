His dream seems to be fulfilled when, one day, he finds a very old and magical book in the library and fascinates him with a short hand. He forges the plan to forge a ring with his best friend Bonav and the rebellious Laura, who can make him invisible. The charm succeeds, but the three friends conjure up all sorts of dangers of magical, but also secular nature. Only the mysterious red wizard Arkandias can now help you out of trouble.","popularity":6.973,"poster_path":"/g9TwXHOlSiMnYBhN0ytBGDMOQ2J.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31229,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinéfrance 1888","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":3578,"logo_path":null,"name":"UGC Distribution","origin_country":""},{"id":17311,"logo_path":"/saew2RWH6qetZyd0AfVoTxUZCRt.png","name":"Les Films du 24","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":19037,"logo_path":"/tceh2aAORA5JxIZSLQ1GkzTBZDL.png","name":"uMedia","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2014-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Secret of Arkandias","video":false,"vote_average":5.245,"vote_count":92}
