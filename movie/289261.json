She is all consumed by her high pressure career and there is little time left to find love. It all changes when she meets Fat, a rap singer that becomes her client. Although at first Victoria has reservations because of her prejudices, she discovers in him a person that, unlike her, enjoys his life and follows his dreams. Through their relationship Victoria learns there is more to life than succeeding, there is also living. Perhaps love is meant to happen instead of being pursued.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":75307,"logo_path":null,"name":"Producciones Garito","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PR","name":"Puerto Rico"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When you have everything you want... and nothing you need","title":"Victoria, and the Pursuit of Happiness","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
