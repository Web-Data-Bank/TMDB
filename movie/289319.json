Fabian Gibbs plays a black Montreal college student forced to leave school when his girlfriend Pat Dillon becomes pregnant. Gibbs resents this interruption in his plans, but he becomes a very good provider. The responsibilities of parenthood, alas, irreparably damage the boy-girl relationship. Filmed in a quasidocumentary manner, Sitting in Limbo seems predestined to win film festival awards--as indeed it has.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/enrpWFB69MHyuJjjwOp0Z357VSi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sitting in Limbo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
