And this kitty's not so cool he can't get a little scared, like when he, Jon and Odie discover that a closed-down haunted house is really open, or that leftovers occasionally ran rampant in the fridge. Garfield has a big imagination, too, as you'll see when he imagines himself as a fish or a werewolf, or even Jon for a day!  There's much more to the fat cat's story, so grab some pasta, flop on the couch and tune in for some cat-toon fun with Garfield!","popularity":1.797,"poster_path":"/k6Pw8SjESyINoGHgKe4IcCD9p88.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3635,"logo_path":"/e4dCQJpJjwL46i1WuGpTIO3srL6.png","name":"20th Century Fox Home Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-09-04","revenue":50000,"runtime":127,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Garfield sometimes falls asleep and has some pretty wild dreams!","title":"Garfield and Friends: Dreams & Schemes","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
