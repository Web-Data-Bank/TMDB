Do they influence violent behavior? What effect have they had on society? How would you describe videogames to Leonardo da Vinci? These are always great questions to start a conversation.  Pixel Poetry is a documentary film about progressive creative culture as it has been championed by one of its greatest advocates - videogames. Using popular debates that have long surrounded videogames as a catalyst for this, the film will analyze the misunderstood notions and arguments in art and technological advancement to bring a new perspective to a compelling discussion about the evolution of its meaning.","popularity":1.097,"poster_path":"/iW0WtSftGsyOYKJoMixCZCTlnAT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100448,"logo_path":null,"name":"Devolver Digital","origin_country":""},{"id":43387,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gamestar Arts","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Film About Games, Art, Society, and Culture.","title":"Pixel Poetry","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":5}
