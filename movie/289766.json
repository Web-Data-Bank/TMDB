The film is comprised of Ron performing his music (distinct and live for the camera), interwoven with very intimate black box 'interviews' with Ron (shot tightly and directly addressed to the camera), in which he discusses the songs and the life that informed them: late nights, dark alleys, marriage, children, divorce, his near death and recovery from drug addiction... and punctuated with back stage moments, insight from the street, and Ron's nephew author Joel Thomas Hynes, taking the role of 'chorus of the people'.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":99340,"logo_path":null,"name":"Get Set Films","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":14072,"logo_path":"/2pfrsSUYN62UqpBFKn10in7Kjfc.png","name":"Picture Plant","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2010-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Man of a Thousand Songs","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
