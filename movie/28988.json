Said falls in with a group of old men looking for their bombed-out village; he offers to guide them, and takes as his wife Halaleh, the clan's lone woman, a widow with a young son. Reeboir attaches himself to a dozen pre-teen boys weighed down by contraband they carry across the border; they're mules, always on the move. Said and Reeboir try to teach as their potential students keep walking. Danger is close; armed soldiers patrol the skies, the roads, and the border. Is there a role for a teacher? Is there hope?","popularity":1.453,"poster_path":"/ApLKw8jjGTp7M4FbivX3mHXJ6da.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":54378,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fabrica","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":13518,"logo_path":"/4k4pfsETuAGPlmJ3yLkiTmOi9v1.png","name":"Makhmalbaf Film House Productions","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/6EFUenZrAK7IBbirooJ4ZLzJpJ5.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2000-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kurdish","iso_639_1":"ku","name":""},{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blackboards","video":false,"vote_average":6.629,"vote_count":31}
