We peek into the life of a Manila cop whose day is made up of dealing with denizens and the crimes they commit. At work, he may be all tough and stern, but at home, we see his more sensitive side. He has this mysterious routine of taking out a can of sterilized milk from a cupboard and depositing his revolver in its place. Later on, it is revealed why he makes the switch and how it is like to live by his duty as a policeman to serve and protect.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":24285,"logo_path":null,"name":"Unitel Pictures","origin_country":"PH"},{"id":57664,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nestlé Philippines","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2011-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"To serve and to protect.","title":"Silup","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
