Videosyncracy follows three very different video rental stores as they negotiate their survival in three distinct Los Angeles neighborhoods: Old Bank DVD in the Downtown arts district, Vidiots in sunny seaside Santa Monica, and Eddie Brandtâ€™s Saturday Matinee in bustling North Hollywood. Their stories chronicle not only the birth and twilight of a particular kind of corner store, but also decades of personal lives intertwined with those of their communities, the new challenges and facilities of a rapidly changing world, and an enduring love of the movies, a slice of Americana on the brink of disappearance yet defiant to the end.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5ylQJnuEi1UdWENITgYUxdrE61Z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Dare to be different.","title":"Videosyncracy","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
