There's also some voiceovers of different artists and graphics designers talking about the field and it's possibilities. Obviously, this is a rather dated documentary and it's interesting to see how far things have come from the \"futuristic wizardry\" the back of the box for this says you'll witness.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fXBIvyCjrNuxTi720mtLGsukIVF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Computer Animation Magic","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
