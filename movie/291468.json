As the band is probably never going to perform in this line-up again, \"Focul Viu\" is a must-have for every fan of Negura Bunget who didn't have a chance to witness the band live before their split. \"Focul Viu\" is available as DVD, 2CD, and as a box-set including both formats.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":32596,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lupus Lounge","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2011-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Negură Bunget: Focul viu","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
