Two of them use jury-rigged batteries to power a camera and make a documentary. We see a variety of approaches to survival, from the artist and engineer who trade for their needs, to the surfers and woodsmen who fish and hunt, to the scavengers, and a communal farm. We also see how the community deals with those who threaten it, and how the youth are growing up with different values from those who knew our world.","popularity":2.012,"poster_path":"/pJvyF49D68iakVlYDusmdz7gGXw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20072,"logo_path":null,"name":"Epidemic Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ever Since the World Ended","video":false,"vote_average":4.4,"vote_count":14}
