The only thing missing from his life is a good woman to share it with. But after dating a string of nightmarish women from gold diggers to ditzes, he begins to wonder if finding Mrs. Right is even possible anymore. Enter Alexandra - a stunningly beautiful attorney that is now being considered for the promotion that Martin was actually next in line for. Thrown into a tailspin, Martin tries to upstage his competition, but her cut-throat charm and razor-sharp wit quickly turn his world upside down and before long he's left wondering if the woman stealing his job - might also be stealing his heart.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uuFAkwV1mo7B50zsfOHPPhXyO5E.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6122,"logo_path":"/z8mLqPJLnGl7Ebzw1i43cfYDLqt.png","name":"New Sensations","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Laws of Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
