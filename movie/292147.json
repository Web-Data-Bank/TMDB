And this, even though Baron von Wehrhahn, who is loyal to the prince, does everything possible to make “his Highness” popular. The only problem is, he’s always using his zeal on the wrong crowd. He always seems to see free-thinkers or revolutionaries in the harmless of citizens; but the really bad ones get to go on their way unmolested! For example, the old woman Wolff: she steals everything that isn’t nailed down, while her husband pursues unhampered poaching.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/GSUBE8hg7jb5b0AgHLXkWqW3Zx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29546,"logo_path":null,"name":"F.D.F.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1937-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der Biberpelz","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
