In the early years, Mitra is repeatedly punished as the warden tries to break her. This includes punishment for delivering a baby in the prison cell while all of the prison staff has taken shelter during an Iraqi bombing. The warden's attitude starts to change after 8 years, when Mitra tries to protect a new inmate from rape at the hands of her older cellmates. When the baby comes back in 1991 as a 17 year old delinquent, Sepideh, the warden respects Mitra enough to protect the girl.","popularity":0.631,"poster_path":"/fTWpsDZchjFeWUt1IMR9UJBa41i.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32954,"logo_path":null,"name":"Omid Film","origin_country":"IR"},{"id":32955,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bamdad Film","origin_country":"IR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2002-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Women's Prison","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":7}
