Can the rare and unpredictable night of the carrots save everyone, or will their connections to the room's electrical sockets restrain them too much? Will Diego find love with an egg that speaks incessantly in German? Will the cellist, who is actually a room full of a gelatinous substance, affected in some way by buttons labeled K, G, and B, have dreams that explain everything? Or will the audience just leave scratching their heads? Not all questions get answered.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fPBZyVTCn9po2z890fYr1SAx0Yk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12432,"logo_path":"/zOgIPe7TadxPBpuUsoWWSryYO6y.png","name":"Eesti Joonisfilm","origin_country":"EE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"1998-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Night of the Carrots","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":6}
