The comedy’s plot is not much: Told by his exasperated father to find a job, a klutzy rich kid named Art (Joe Moore) follows a bevy of dancers to their nightclub, where he tricks the maître d' into hiring him as a waiter.  No guest proves safe from Art’s clumsy antics, but the shapely cabaret performers, led by Mademoiselle Fifi (Gloria Joy), dance on in the ensuing chaos.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/i6pddIPkgUn7Sk2la1RiTP7I15I.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":172250,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sherwood MacDonald Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1925-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moonlight Nights","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
