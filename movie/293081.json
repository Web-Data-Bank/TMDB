Romildo searches for his brother's body in a cemetery in the suburb of Rio de Janeiro. Mothers cry for their children, murdered by the police in the slums. They belong to the group \"Tortura Nunca Mais\", which, interacting between a traumatic memory and oblivion, brings up the memory of recent events. They also reveal the selectivity of official history and build a political memory. They think of the past so that they can free the future from the ghosts they still chase in the present.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2007-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Memória para Uso Diário","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
