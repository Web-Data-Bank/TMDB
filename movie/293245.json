Pikachu is “it,” and it goes off in search of its friends. Meanwhile, Larvitar, sick of being all by itself, kicks a rock in anger. The rock hurtles through the air—and hits a lawnmower, turning it on and sending it tearing off after Pikachu and its friends! The group draws the lawnmower into a maze and even gets it into the water, but the lawnmower just keeps on chasing. The Pokémon build a road out of logs, hoping to get the lawnmower into a shack, but Psyduck trips and ruins the whole setup. How will the friends ever escape the lawnmower? This fantasy will have you on the edge of your seat!","popularity":2.763,"poster_path":"/kpwwkLkkamAQIfxMj68gghHU7S1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5372,"logo_path":"/tPtJc2rCOTHEzJQPStT6m3dI0eK.png","name":"OLM","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":89164,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pikachu Project 2001","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":9149,"logo_path":"/isLUpud9N56ifftJZ4XvzwBBpoG.png","name":"Shogakukan","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":5261,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shogakukan Production","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":11644,"logo_path":"/1fhfHRzI3GrXRjfuGTLaERshdzu.png","name":"Tomy","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":3034,"logo_path":"/kGRavMqgyx4p2X4C96bjRCj50oI.png","name":"TV Tokyo","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":7967,"logo_path":"/4W9ByL6mMDn9UOHh8oGD36l3BnN.png","name":"Media Factory","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":12654,"logo_path":"/hBWpNb7x4R77xxltwNtM0ANboW6.png","name":"The Pokémon Company","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":8157,"logo_path":"/yHOC2PPmj6j2zzRqwdufCZauFxI.png","name":"East Japan Marketing \u0026 Communications","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2001-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pikachu's PikaBoo","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":11}
