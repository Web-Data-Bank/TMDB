Even the King would stand up when Radziwiłł the Black entered the room. Members of the Radziwiłł family weren’t afraid to defend the Reformers when the fires of the Inquisition burned across Europe. It was a Radziwiłł who went on one of the most challenging pilgrimages from Vilnius to Jerusalem and then published an account, becoming the pioneer of travel literature. A mix of documentary and fiction, past and present, and history and its re-enactment, brings to life the essence of a once-popular saying: “I don’t want to be a king. I want to be a Radziwiłł.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oG0qIgSGDAoV8QHy8tmDV2csFy2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109456,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Nominum","origin_country":"LT"},{"id":108552,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dok Mobile","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":63249,"logo_path":null,"name":"VFS Films","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"},{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2014-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Radviliada","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
