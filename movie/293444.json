The film with comic undertones looks at their stories behind the hedges.  The garden provides a framework for tales of relationship conflicts and joys; it depicts the many ways in which life can flourish; it gives strength and unites, but it also becomes a meeting place for farewells. There is an invisible bond that grows between the couples in the film; they comment and comfort each other with their own stories.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cGY5EdngG6OlvqKWh4SBlEqqlJQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":86915,"logo_path":null,"name":"Made Oy","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2014-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Garden Lovers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
