Full of disgust for everything Finnish, he sees Sweden as heaven. Upon meeting a suicidal Swedish psychologist Mikael Anderson, he seizes an opportunity for an identity switch. Raspberry Boat Refugee is a comedy about cultural differences in the Nordic countries, their nationalism and, not least, prejudices about our neighbours. It also proves how futile it is to try to escape oneself.","popularity":2.295,"poster_path":"/enDEY6Ye0BWyFxYNki9hBtZ1Emd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5240,"logo_path":"/ibvN7yjNr8HR92nOn8d4d6TQrYt.png","name":"Matila Röhr Productions (MRP)","origin_country":"FI"},{"id":2999,"logo_path":"/zGSqFee9aDgDuLD6vcs2mcJUem4.png","name":"SVT","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":2801,"logo_path":"/bswb1PLLsKDUXMLgy42bZtCtIde.png","name":"Film i Väst","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":87872,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eyeworks Sweden","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2014-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Raspberry Boat Refugee","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":10}
