It can put your heart in your throat as you fly over a knoll faster than you have all year, and it can put your mind at ease when you find yourself alone in a snow-covered Aspen grove with clear blue sky above and crisp cold air all around. A ticket is the end of reality and the beginning of a journey. And we've got one for you.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hxht4VsDBf3Dx8nPREpNcmjObSG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Warren Miller: Ticket to Ride","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
