The title and lyrics come from AuderÂ´s friend and 2001 Prix Goncourt winner Jean-Jacques Shuhl. The piece is composed entirely of still photographs from a variety of books and magazines that simultaneously reveal and feed an addiction to spectacle.  With a source that is once removed, Auder's scopophilia is symptomatic of society at large. The song is performed by legendary chanteuse Ingrid Caven. Suffused with a bittersweet melancholy, Canven's seasoned voice compliments Auder's selection of images which dwell on the themes of death, destruction and desire.\r The melody is classic cabaret performed by a piano/violin duo who dramatically heighten the works already dark eroticism.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fY2CglWd4vkzZwqpLRVTQU8QR9x.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Polaroid Cocaine","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
