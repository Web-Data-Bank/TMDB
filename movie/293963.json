He is a 'professional expert,' a talking head that can glue any story together, a man who always has the perfect sound bite for any documentary, whether it's about Winston Churchill, Snuffy Smith or the color blue. In 'Glue Man,' Nick tells the story of how he went from a local news station's man-on-the-street to broadcasting legend at the History Channel. He also reveals his tricks of the trade, including his catch-all phrase for any subject: 'cultural touchstone for our generation.'
