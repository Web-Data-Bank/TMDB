With his entourage (including an amusing Anthony Wong) in tow, he boards the cruise ship Fascination with the intent of ridding himself of his latest set-up. However, he didn’t count on falling for heiress Sandy who is - no surprise here - the only girl who can withstand his “money buys all” attitude. Things aren’t that simple - she’s losing her fortune and won’t let money buy her. Lau must prove that he can be a normal guy so he follows her ashore with a backpack and $10 in his pocket.","popularity":0.952,"poster_path":"/pelMNf4IOxQQBhduhD3vPud1QVF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1999-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fascination Amour","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2}
