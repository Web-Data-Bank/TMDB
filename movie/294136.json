While conservationists howl and corrupt governments fail to address the ongoing slaughter, one brave family has been working for decades to stem the tide, one elephant at a time. Gardeners of Eden is a gripping, first-person experience inside the operations of Kenya's David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust. From the front lines of the crisis, we witness their heroic efforts to stop the poachers in the bush, rescue the orphans of slain elephants and raise them by hand, until one day, returning them to their home in the wild.","popularity":0.963,"poster_path":"/fTA0sGAtbJLrYP2Ve8EOGOO9B0f.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KE","name":"Kenya"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gardeners of Eden","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
