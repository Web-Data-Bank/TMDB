The camera gazes at Jonas, implicating the viewer in the work and further, with her body. Her intentional de-synchronization of the monitor's receiving and transmitting frequencies results in the on-screen image's repeated vertical descent. Creating a sense of fragmentation, the vertical roll relentlessly pounds at the images of the artist as she moves through a series of performed identities. Characterized a \"disjunctive self portrait\" by the Electronic Arts Intermix, the image content of the work is strongly mediated by the mirror-like function of the camera, scrutinized by the lens and subjected to violence by the vertical roll.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ak7ZlezAFaCJdnFgTqz9zvoIval.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vertical Roll","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
