An international story of tangled politics and economics intentionally suppressed by the Chinese, Red Reign shows how a large scale persecution of a minority people can still happen in our modern day society.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xWaK9NybmwxcuOedDXRfYqfYmxA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Red Reign: The Bloody Harvest of China's Prisoners","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
