With salvage crews ordered to clear the crash zone for the busy Easter traffic, the locals undertook their own salvage operation, making it their best Easter ever. Murbah Swamp Beer is a documentary about an event that could only happen in Australia. It captures the spirit of a small, country town as its citizens discover that beer definitely tastes better when it's free.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A documentary that could only be true in Australia","title":"Murbah Swamp Beer","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":2}
