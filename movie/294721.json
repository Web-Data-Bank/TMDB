This alone is enough for me to believe in a certain beauty to life and to have the pleasure of attempting to film it in all its forms (trees, animals, gods, humans...) and to do so when love is intense. The filmmaker has lost a part of innocence. It's so difficult to spot it around you, so difficult not to lose it during a film shoot. I'm grateful to those who you look at on screen. To stand up to time, I've a tactic, which is to dig into my stock of emotions and old images. Not so as to find what will never come back, but to discover the signs of spring in winter. This allows me to begin another day with an easy, light step.\" (Alain Cavalier)","popularity":0.681,"poster_path":"/9xnHXAnqvP9S6hS4a8BcyXQTKX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paradise","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":10}
