Are these predators mindless man eaters demonized by the popular media and movies like \"Jaws\"? That's the driving question behind this high-adrenaline, two-hour live National Geographic event. Shark Attack Experiment: LIVE! will beam from the world's most shark-infested location off the coast of South Africa. Here, a team of free-diving shark junkies and conservationists put their own safety on the line to run a series of hi-tech tests to separate shark attack myths from realities. Also on location during Shark Attack Experiment: LIVE! are shark attack survivors willing to tell their stories and enter the water, some for the first time since their traumatic encounters. Their objective is no stunt; their goal is to raise public awareness that the world's shark species are being destroyed by over-fishing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/slZ6myMsU1rynpkUnOZJUgjJkX6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shark Attack Experiment Live","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
