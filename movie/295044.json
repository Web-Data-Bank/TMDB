The setting is a complicated industry predicated on the supremacy of metaphysically evolved market research. The base commodities are personality traits; while ordinarily they are considered malleable, here they ossify into static examples (“examplize,” to use Trecartin’s term) that can be traded among owners. With market research lording both the supply and demand of existence, characters are wrapped in a knot where their every action is studied, and the findings dictate the brands that pilot everything they do. As a picture of modern consumer society literalized to an extreme, Re’Search Wait’S verges on social science-fiction; and by examplizing Any Ever’s other half into fuel for their own stories, these works tie the seven together as a yin and yang of nihilism and boundless meaning.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Re'Search (Re'Search Wait'S)","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
