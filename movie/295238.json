Made with minimal means with a few rolls of black and white film they managed to scrape together, this is a thoroughly unconventional film that defies traditional narrative structures, spectacularly revealing the director's true vision: a primordial cinema full of imagery that comes out of nowhere and communicates freely, like a small wonder.  A large slice of the international film critic community - including Frenchman Louis Skorecki who described the film as a comet - will adore \"Coatti\" and continue to support Tornes' lonely path until the end.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/a2j0u7fZS8gyUFzW6pILdLc6nBA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Coatti","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":3}
