The aim of their excursion is to test the extent of and overcome their fears using a series of dares. They plan to stay overnight in an underground alpine bunker. As the group initially jokes about the similarity of their situation with THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, the game soon turns into an unpredictable trial of courage for them all. This no-budget-horror-experiment from director Stefan Jäger takes us into the uncomfortable underworld of the Swiss réduit, a huge defence complex, the construction of which began before the First World War.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/eZc7RxFwe8F2OBqr6lCufPjlJlJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34086,"logo_path":"/aBKkhycyubHlCsszV8KibiKZGg0.png","name":"tellfilm","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2014-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"11:23 - 09:59 (About Fear)","video":false,"vote_average":2.923,"vote_count":13}
