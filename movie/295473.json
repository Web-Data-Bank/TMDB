A professional magician’s car breaks down and he ends up spending an emotionally intense night with a young, widowed toll booth worker. A singer songwriter serving a lengthy prison sentence is released for one night to perform at a local community centre. These three deeply engaging stories about yearning for connection unfold in parallel, one New Year’s Eve in a small town in central Uruguay, balancing the universality of human suffering with a powerful sense of hope.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wNIHj8ocQRdeLdHdbcfRURfDF7e.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34171,"logo_path":null,"name":"Raindogs Cine","origin_country":"UY"},{"id":88545,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Calefón Cine","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2014-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Moonless Night","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":8}
