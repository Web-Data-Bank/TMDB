Since government director Steinbei√ül has announced that he wants to witness the awarding ceremony in person, district magistrate Kranzeder decided to splash out. He organises, with his wife Amalie, a banquet in their parlour, although both of them rather begrudge Neusigl the award. But after all, it is necessary to cut a good figure for the dignitaries. As the government director arrives, after a few incidents during his journey, belated, the event, however, has already degenerated into a boozy carousal which culminates in a scuffle.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/maHieOoy7HhjS9j2fBN4owxMhwg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91760,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hubert Schonger Produktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1960-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oh, diese Bayern!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
