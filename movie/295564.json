One morning, several armed young men, dressed in military uniform, kidnap a Senior Army General and hide him in a modest cottage. There, without the hostage’s awareness of either the reason for his imprisonment or the people who planned it, the young kidnappers subject him to summary trial. In subsequent days, the military man will respond to an interrogation as severe as precise, that will lay bare the tense contradiction between two political and moral ideologies so incompatible that destruction surely awaits one of the opposite fields. The ending unveils a new chapter of a contemporary drama.","popularity":1.213,"poster_path":"/xg1vRNKTQMfh9XNBhkp7wXuVmX3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":142735,"logo_path":null,"name":"Saula Benavente (AR)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2011-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Abduction and death","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":4}
