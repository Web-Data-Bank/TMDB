In between you'll find lush green fields, many wild life, but also the diverse way its people live. Because though Taiwan houses some of the world's biggest cities, the mountains running through the middle of the island cut the urbanised west from the more rural east. At the same time, Taiwan has a lot of different aboriginal tribes. Through this you might just come to appreciate Taiwan better than ever before.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xryHzDydDzpKNGEJ8vAgBa9NLni.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2011-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Taiwan, Where Mountains Meet the Sea","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
