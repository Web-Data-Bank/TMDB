He is stricken with overpowering tiredness, everything is too difficult, the world an insurmountable obstacle course. The young man is suffering from a syndrome that used to be called neurasthenia and is today known as burn-out. He can't sleep, has neither strength nor courage and spends the night in his car. Life parked in a dead-end. Visually stunning and with an almost documentary feel, the film shows the man's life as a parable for the young generation in Iran.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2M9yxUfwlEmq9Ib7Co74GZrCpg6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2014-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Neurasthenia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
