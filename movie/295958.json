A prodigy who was acclaimed as the natural heir to his bebop mentor, Charlie Parker, Morgan derailed his career with heroin, which led him into a life of crime. After decades in prison, he made an astonishing comeback, leaving behind recordings of deep, melancholy beauty. Framed by a tribute concert held in San Quentin, where Morgan’s 19-year-old Asian-American protégé, Grace Kelly, performs a heart-stopping version of “Over the Rainbow,” N.C. Heikin’s film is filled with revealing interviews with the colleagues, lovers, family and wives who accompanied Morgan on his long and rocky journey to redemption.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sound of Redemption: The Frank Morgan Story","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
