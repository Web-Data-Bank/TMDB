She believes her family's explanation that her looks were inherited from her dark-skinned Sicilian grandfather. But when her parents abruptly split, her gut starts to tell her something different.  At age of 18, she finally confronts her mother and learns the truth: her biological father was not the man who raised her, but a black man named Rodney with whom her mother had had an affair.","popularity":2.122,"poster_path":"/xVCsF8pDfCGIAWW0L16tbXFr1ia.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152514,"logo_path":"/kARX4cWjZEjBQ6HOcPafXvjoeAM.png","name":"Truth Aid","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Little White Lie","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":7}
