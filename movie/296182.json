The much-discussed ‘Seidl method’ is conveyed here vividly and directly: The camera watches over Seidl’s shoulder during the filming of his new production IM KELLER, and observes him at the rehearsals for his latest theatre production ‘Böse Buben / Fiese Männer’. The film paints the picture of a fascinating and exceptional artist using a combination of extensive interviews and excerpts from earlier works.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nbzrvo5xtUvN3qGZQS887tWQhxq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":66486,"logo_path":null,"name":"Navigator Film","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2014-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ulrich Seidl - A Director at Work","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
