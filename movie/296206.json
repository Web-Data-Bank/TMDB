Dennis Rodman was amongst the crowd on the stage. This roast featured a large amount of jokes and satire regarding sex directed from roasters toward fellow roasters, complete with Andy Dick appearing as Pamela's plastic surgeon and groping her breasts as part of his skit. Many of the jokes were also directed at Courtney Love for appearing to be inebriated (but claiming to have been sober for a year), Bea Arthur's masculinity, Andy Dick's ambiguous sexuality and Lisa Lampanelli's full figured body as well as her attraction towards black people.  One of the audience members was Anna Nicole Smith.","popularity":4.99,"poster_path":"/dHNFoV8ogxvl9eaHVpLzTDu2cI2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1538,"logo_path":"/3q7NjXSLVUPQ24CG3zrBPK7GQqH.png","name":"Comedy Central","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Comedy Central Roast of Pamela Anderson","video":false,"vote_average":6.534,"vote_count":44}
