A true race against time then starts for the young couple and revolves around Brice's quirky cousin Jacques, a native from the village, prone to mystical visions that will eventually lead them all to the Vatican! In a climate of provincial burlesque comedy both tender and grotesque, the Chapon-Laroche village microcosm, especially our endearing trio, will inexorably undergo a series of metamorphoses.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oYswHD7P2RWUHEo2WzZbwFTDjWZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20482,"logo_path":"/ncZtCy1XzmVeN674GNBDdvMc8b0.png","name":"Iota Production","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2015-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jacques a vu","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
