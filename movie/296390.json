The human aspect of the story centers on a rodeo rider whose late father bequeathed him a ranch in Calgary, Canada. The rider really tries to settle down to ranching, but finds himself pining for the rodeo. His forewoman, also a former rodeo performer, thinks her employer is shirking his duties and needs to forget about broncos, and bull-riding and settle down. Meanwhile, the fellow also longs to catch the white stallion running wild. The dog helps out.","popularity":0.871,"poster_path":"/mH0mZWsYluQBLZFCPkI0V8t40Yj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4927,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eagle-Lion Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1948-07-28","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"THRILL to the most daring death duel ever filmed---the \"White Outlaw\" battling a snarling, fear-crazed wolfpack!","title":"Northwest Stampede","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
