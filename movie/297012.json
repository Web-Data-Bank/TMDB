The RCA Photophone System is the credited process, and Carl Edouarde is credited with \"synchronization.\" The film continues the long-running silent series of Aesop's Fables (\"sugar coated pills of wisdom\" as the end titles remarked) that the studio turned out. This entry displays the lively brand of \"rubber hose\" animation that was common in the early sound era. The story opens as a swarm of white shoe-clad flies cavort in a kitchen (gags include a soft-shoe number danced over spilled salt and a cop fly directing traffic around a piece of flypaper). The story shifts outside as a fly calls his gal on the phone. Here some rare lip-synch is attempted during the dialogue; Van Beuren usually avoided dialogue in the years to come in favor of songs to help the story along.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nxSyjptMQIU6YO0es5TduPxRDE4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1929-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fly's Bride","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2}
