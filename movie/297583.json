Director Rod Swenson was on hand one sweaty night in 1977 to document Blondie ripping through a good part of their debut album while also throwing in some incredible covers from The Yardbirds, The Runaways and Freddy Cannon. The video is lifted and digitized right off the original videotapes, retaining a grit that makes the viewer feel like they were actually there that night as Blondie and punk rock was in the midst of firming its grip on the city. Highlights include In The Sun, Man Overboard, A Shark In Jets Clothing, In The Flesh, X-Offender, Rip Her To Shreds, I Love Playing With Fire and a special rehearsal clip of Denis.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sqec7bhqcEBNdViDQXipzEFhHWM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blondie: Live at CBGB 1977","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
