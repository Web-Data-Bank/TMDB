Over the course of six months, their expedition traveled by icebreaker, canoe, and dog sled, capturing the Canadian fur trade in a silent feature documentary. The Romance of the Far Fur Country was released in 1920, two years before the legendary film Nanook of the North. Rediscovering the documentary in a British archive, another film crew begins a journey to resurrect the lost film, taking it to the communities where the film was originally shot. Images come to life; people recognize faces, landscapes, and lost traditions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On the Trail of the Far Fur Country","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
