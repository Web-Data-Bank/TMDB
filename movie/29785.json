The visual content of the film consists largely of archival clips of the city from the 1940s to the 1960s, their nostalgic charm darkened by accompanying music and the counterpoint of Davies’ dry, at times dyspeptic, voice-over narration. His voice thickens with emotion as he recalls the delights of juvenile movie-going or the ritual of a holiday trip to New Brighton, across the River Mersey, and hardens with contempt when he turns his gaze on the hoopla surrounding Queen Elizabeth’s coronation in 1953. The film is a powerful evocation of the director's youth in post-war Britain and a reflection on how his home city has changed over the years.","popularity":2.476,"poster_path":"/1kdvuMUOTBkcjtWNwL9W0sEmaQG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":43274,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hurricane Films","origin_country":""},{"id":23012,"logo_path":null,"name":"Northwest Vision and Media","origin_country":""},{"id":23013,"logo_path":null,"name":"Digital Departures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2008-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A love song and a eulogy","title":"Of Time and the City","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":28}
