His wife and daughter Anna receive the guests who are invited to the feast, with a dish of pike as the main course.  But suddenly, the celebration turns sour at the appearance of an unexpected guest - namely Oberholzer's brother Alois, the black sheep of the family, who disappeared years ago. As it turns out, Alois has since changed his name to \"Obolski\" and become ringmaster of a major circus. Him and his wife Iduna quickly threaten the morals and standards of the bourgeois party, and they proceed to turn the boring proceedings into a turbulent circus show. Fortunately, after much confusion, the story ends happily - altough the pike has burned black in the oven!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":483,"logo_path":"/mCEJD7utltKsFY1fPVM4uWQGmvz.png","name":"Praesens-Film AG","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":134,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der schwarze Hecht","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
