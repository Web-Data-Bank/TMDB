They land on the California coast and run into some guys, where they have fun and a few close encounters at the beach. One of the guys' Uncle Bud, who just wants to meditate and hang out, is being threatened with condemnation of his beach house unless he puts some money into repairs. The alien babes offer to enter the bikini contest with their way-out designs to try and win the money he needs, but they are hampered by the garment designer who will stop at nothing to win.","popularity":7.489,"poster_path":"/v5TXbzoPvjsU1JAM8mS7E0gMJro.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26866,"logo_path":null,"name":"TorchLight Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1993-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"They Boldly Go Where No Woman Has Dared Go Before!","title":"Beach Babes from Beyond","video":false,"vote_average":3.3,"vote_count":21}
