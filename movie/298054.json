The very strict mayor (Karl Skraup) not only rejects the marriage of his son with a Viennese woman, but he also denies 40 kids their intended holiday--paid for by the provincial government--because they are illegitimate children. The entanglements only get bigger when two reporters start writing about it. When the local nurse (Maria Andergast) pretends to be the mayor's illegitimate daughter, his resistance is finally overcome.","popularity":0.621,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1950-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On the Alm, there's no sin","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
