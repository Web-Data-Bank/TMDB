The format is \"run what ya brung\" Unlimited 4 Wheel Drive Racing, and the stakes are higher than ever. Only 20% of the teams that take the green flag will make it to the end, the remainder being left strewn across the desert floor in the wake of one of the hardest off road races on the planet, the King of the Hammers. Follow teams in 'Element of Survival' as they set out to conquer harsh desert at speeds in excess of 100mph, as well as some of the hardest rock crawling North America has to offer, all in an effort to be crowned \"King\" at the setting of the sun.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rS6uNKGNLGl8xtbjsIJlZGJmUXa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":35661,"logo_path":null,"name":"HeavyMetalConcepts","origin_country":""},{"id":35660,"logo_path":null,"name":"HammerKing Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"All Greatness is Earned","title":"Element of Survival","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
