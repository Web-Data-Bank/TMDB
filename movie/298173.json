The encounter is marked by many confrontations as well as cheerful moments. Reminiscent of the sweet children's poems that mother recited are countered by Elsschot's Marriage: 'He thought: I'll kill her and set light to the house...' It also turns out that father had once disappeared for eighteen months, a 'secret' that the daughters have different ideas about. Brittle, an intimate film version of a play written and performed by the same actresses, is about rivalry in a family, the right to silence, but also about the need for solidarity. At the Netherlands Film Festival in 1997 the Golden Calf for Best Actress was awarded to the five actresses together.","popularity":0.621,"poster_path":"/lzIddNdoowov7qMaShfmvi8r3zB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":43565,"logo_path":"/hNAOu2cYkKP0S0BTKaGoKmp93om.png","name":"SNG Film (Studio Nieuwe Gronden)","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":8659,"logo_path":"/96hCWEsfmTZQsoUap0CcG21qaA.png","name":"VPRO","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1997-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brittle","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
