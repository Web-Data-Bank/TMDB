Veronica has an unusual companion - Ronnie who is the exact opposite of Veronica. Her friend Niki is a fun loving person and cannot at all understand Veronica's prudishness. At Niki's suggestion, she and Veronica go shopping for some new, sexy clothes for Veronica's changing personality - which becomes the catalyst for a film revealing many layers of sexual denial and redemption.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3gjWw9KhBJJPHcfQ5gDVklsxN3C.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60875,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kemal Enterprises","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Blue Ecstasy... an emotion to remember","title":"Blue Ecstasy","video":false,"vote_average":8.7,"vote_count":3}
