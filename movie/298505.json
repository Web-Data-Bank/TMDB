PHANTOM POWER is a kind of sum of these rich and lavish efforts, a poetic series of cinematic fragments, an inventory of his cinematic output. What unfolds between russian folk songs and Ingrid Caven’s singing, between micro-dramas and found footage, is the poetic world of this wayward and still unknown artist, whose discovery and recognition is long overdue.  - Viennale","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Phantom Power","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
