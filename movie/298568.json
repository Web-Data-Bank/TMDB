One day, his future son-in-law, the jeweler Fabian, is arrested on suspicion of murder on the day before his wedding.  He is said to have murdered his ex-wife, the dancer Ria Norady.  The conductor Gillmore found her dead in her dressing room shortly after a visit from Fabian.  Gisela Jordan asks her father to defend him.  After speaking to Fabian, the lawyer is convinced he's innocent.
