One day the government calls on farmer Esposito. He's told to sell his farm to make space for a new motorway linking northern and southern Italy. He has no intention of complying. His son Francisco is in love with village-beauty Maria but it all ends in tears. Frustrated and fed up with country-life he moves to Milan and fucks a few beautiful women. His doomed love to Maria and the death of his father push him into marriage with a woman he doesn't really love. In his twilight years Francesco starts an investigation as to what might have become of Maria and he finds out that she ended up in a convent. There she spends her days as a frustrated nun, grieving for her lost love.","popularity":4.578,"poster_path":"/yLIFmpzRsBHbBRJuDhCuUFqvoDs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6200,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mario Salieri Entertainment Group","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sweet Life","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2}
