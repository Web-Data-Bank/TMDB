University is over and each of them is about to embark on a new path: some will stay in Pisa, some will return home to their parents, and some will move to another city or even country. That protected period of their life in which infinite opportunities awaited them, is fading away – now is the time for decisions and responsibility: love or a well-paid job? Have a child or wait for better circumstances? Follow your dreams or be happy with whatever comes your way? Once thing is certain: their carefree university days are over and nothing will ever be the same again.","popularity":1.109,"poster_path":"/x1dTSyV6ckzgwKD0vlZZ5pbpGdS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5832,"logo_path":null,"name":"Microcinema International","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2015-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"So Far So Good","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":30}
