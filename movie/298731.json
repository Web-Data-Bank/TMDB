A Blutengel-concert is like an audiovisual experience in cinemascope. It was, thus, rather obvious that a documentation of Blutengels Labyrinth-tour would have to be on DVD.\r Moments of Our LIVEs not only makes you relive a show from that tour it also documents the tour feeling in conveying the atmosphere of the places where the songs were recorded.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blutengel - Moments of Our LIVEs","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
