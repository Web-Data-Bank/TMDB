Lot’s of big dance numbers reminds us that Mary started her career as a dancer. Moore sings and dances to rock, pop, and classical pieces in a show that's drawn from the Bible and fleshed out with allegory about man's creation, fall and rebirth. The show takes the form of surrealistic dream sequences that range from the fanciful to the solemn, and that have Mary playing the roles of angel, devil and woman.\" Manhattan Transfer does \"Sympathy for the Devil,\" perhaps worth the price of admission right there.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/n7tDfMztu4ziAmoR5OMhaddbplR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15847,"logo_path":null,"name":"MTM Enterprises","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1976-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mary's Incredible Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
