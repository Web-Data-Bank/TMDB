I’m back and fitter than ever, and this is all thanks to my new Super Body Workout DVD.  My personal trainer Mark is an ex-Marine, and runs my workouts like a real Sergeant Major, so we decided that military–style fitness training would be a great concept for the DVD. It’s fun and pacy, full of variety and gets the very best results.  Each routine is completely self-contained and designed to work your whole body. There are two complete 40 minute routines for you to do – and both of them include their own warm-up and cool-down, so no excuses for skipping those bits!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Davina Super Body Workout","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
