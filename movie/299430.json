When the most important of these computers exhibits strange patterns during a crucial operation, its counterpart, a top scientist named Melody, begins having psychic experiences. For a low-budget film, a surprisingly deep exploration of emotions vs. logic and the elusive search for truth.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/6QKaIlvemPPZ8mBT7uWcAFrlLML.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":36603,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lightscape Motion Picture Company","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1984-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Music of the Spheres","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":5}
