After reading a book of his poetry, she finds herself even more drawn to the taciturn Keats. Although he agrees to teach her about poetry, Keats cannot act on his reciprocated feelings for Fanny, since as a struggling poet he has no money to support a wife.","popularity":8.617,"poster_path":"/csN6y4nq2kaBiegHaGw0DGp4plf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":288,"logo_path":"/aW0IpM9d4Zjj978EqgDVSxXXhTj.png","name":"BBC Film","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":866,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Renn Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":2452,"logo_path":"/6CLoZ59fLPG7UyxQtGTqRevjf58.png","name":"UK Film Council","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":7584,"logo_path":"/eGkfvvyf4fJTvBUR1xt1669IPA3.png","name":"Screen Australia","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":26716,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hopscotch Productions","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":26717,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jan Chapman Films","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":1380,"logo_path":"/y4JH9ncZJAFJGYWK84k1dmXnsw0.png","name":"Australian Film Finance Corporation","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2009-11-05","revenue":14374652,"runtime":119,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"First love burns brightest.","title":"Bright Star","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":392}
