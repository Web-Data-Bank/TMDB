With the aid of performance footage, rare archive, exclusive interviews and some of the most exciting music ever recorded, this programme offers an experience of these events second only to having lived through them. Features new interviews with Richard Hell, Suicide's Alan Vega, Blondie's Gary Valentine and many more.","popularity":1.023,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":192,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Punk Revolution NYC","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
