Of course that's easy for these three veterans of comedy since their first language is English. Filmed at the El Portal Theater the 3 Non Juans talk about the joys and perils of living in a Spanish speaking culture without speaking a word of Spanish and making a living doing it in a not so brown world, all stereo types welcome. This show is definitely for the Spanish Impaired...IT'S IN ENGLISH PEOPLE!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/z7XwaWTIAaX6w6lIutjI3QqSKWx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"3 Non Juans","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
