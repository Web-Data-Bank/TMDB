A strange and unique bond is forged against the stark contrast of their different lives and the back drop of the harsh realities of drugs, prostitution and gang life. Somehow these two find sanctuary in each other; Martina helps Hyun reconnect with the world around him and he helps this overly cynical young girl believe in dreams again. Intense, raw performances bring rare emotional veracity and intimacy to a delicate story. An impressive team of emerging talent create a moving, perceptual film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1rU3R3XAhWEzfS16BuCCc0KdoC7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Little Thief","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
