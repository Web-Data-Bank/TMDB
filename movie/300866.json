Illustrated by archive footage and home movies, her voice-over describes her family's personal story, Yugoslavia under Tito, and the recent war, accompanied by some particularly shocking footage. The nature shots and the alternation of classical, popular and revolutionary music occasionally lend the stories a light-hearted tone.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1bAW5IB0JE8cYBd1WIli4VWFvwg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46293,"logo_path":"/pjWMfuWBbQwVUYMAssuoDj0B3xv.png","name":"Dream Factory Macedonia","origin_country":"MK"},{"id":109096,"logo_path":null,"name":"Petra Pan Film Production","origin_country":"SI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CU","name":"Cuba"},{"iso_3166_1":"MK","name":"Macedonia"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"2006-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Grandmothers of the Revolution","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
