The goal of the ongoing JOB project is to find and bring together the latest and greatest filmers and freeskiers every year, combining their talents under artistic direction, and creating a boundary breaking ski movie. The movie won the \"Coup de Coeur\" at iF3 2012 in Montreal and \"Best European Movie\" at iF3 2012 in Annecy!  The team at JOB then created its own plotline—a story of a lost alien who crashes into a snowy tundra, which should be cheesy but ends up being funny and well-envisioned—and wove the five winning teams’ final edits together to create an interesting, action-packed 40-minute film. As a result of the unique locales and talent to each crew, In Space brings a level of diversity to the table that other films can’t match.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Junkies on a Budget: In Space","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
