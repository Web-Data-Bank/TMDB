One day he spies a pretty girl in his telescope and sends her by carrier pigeon a note that, alas, is received by the wrong party. The Girl marries and, poverty-striken, leaves her husband during a snowstorm. Harry takes her in, and minutes later her child is born. He works like a slave for the mother and child, pretending they are his own. Meanwhile, the husband finds her and comes to the shack on Christmas Eve as Harry is preparing to play Santa Claus. Not realizing the unhappiness she is causing him, The Girl thanks him profusely and leaves with her husband. Overcome, Harry sits overnight on the doorstep and the next morning is found frozen stiff except for his eyes--with amusing results.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6ym8dQWvZUCBh90bEL0jzEkyJyX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14254,"logo_path":null,"name":"Harry Langdon Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1927-08-28","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Under the magic of Harry's wistful smile, the world of make-believe turns into life- sad, joyous, bitter-sweet...just as life is","title":"Three's a Crowd","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":6}
