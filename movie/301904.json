His budget, alas, does not include nor anticipate the plans of Sally and her parents. This short was reissued in June of 1950 to be shown as a trailer with 1950's \"Father of the Bride\" and some sources think this short was made for that express purpose and date it as a 1950 film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bHiW3KFsHolrm4wOkEyyXM1vJFg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/5Va1Ie5c4sjfEYqixQ3L8qg7fKu.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1940-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wedding Bills","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
