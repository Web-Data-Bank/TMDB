As he only signs an \"M\" on his work, Monika has no difficulty in claiming she is \"M\", but problems arrive when she is commissioned to do a large mural and Maler refuses to help her out. However, his creative spirit gets the best of him and he does the mural which is widely acclaimed to be a great work of art. Felder , an art dealer, is not overly pleased with this turn of events as he has been pleading with Monika to divorce her shiftless husband and marry him.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dJ52nCaz3YY8eR6pzk7g4lQbEHm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":30187,"logo_path":null,"name":"Meteor Film GmbH","origin_country":""},{"id":619,"logo_path":null,"name":"Terra-Filmkunst","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1937-08-20","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Versprich mir nichts!","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":4}
