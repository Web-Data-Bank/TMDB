Every time the government send their task force to bulldoze their village, she and the thousand or so other inhabitants soon pick up the pieces and build another one. Her best friend, Blessing, is about to give birth here in a few weeks and Esther is worried for her safety. But when she discovers text messages from another woman on her husband's phone, she suddenly has problems of her own to deal with. Plans to turn Lagos into a 'megacity' involve demolishing the slums, which house so many of its inhabitants. The film follows Sagede, a member of the newly established Lagos State Environmental and Special Offences Enforcement Unit, which targets illegal dwellings all over the city, clearing away everything in their path.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Welcome to Lagos is a British three-part mini-series which originally aired on BBC Two in April 2010.","title":"Welcome To Lagos Episode 3 - Kuramo Beach","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
