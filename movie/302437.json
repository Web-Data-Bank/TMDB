In northern India, Bhargava filmed the ravishing images of an eight-day Holi festival held in the city of Mathura, mythic birthplace of Krishna. Iyer – who released his ECM debut, Mutations, earlier this year – then composed his score as the musical complement to Bhargava’s beautiful visual ballet, drawing at times on the rhythms and chants of the Holi festival; the result is one of Iyer’s warmest, most colorful creations to date, as rich melodically as it is texturally. RADHE RADHE: Rites of Holi is a kaleidoscopic experience.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"RADHE RADHE: Rites of Holi","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
