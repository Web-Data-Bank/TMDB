Recorded during Wakeman's 2000 U.K. tour, he performs the entire set solo, often chatting with the audience (and he proves to be quite comical, telling a Spinal Tap-esque story of a concert from the mid-'70s that went terribly wrong due to overdrinking and faulty stage props). Included are such highlights as a medley of Yes' \"And You and I\"/\"Wondrous Stories,\" a new age reworking of the Beatles' \"Help\" and \"Eleanor Rigby,\" as well as such solo favorites as \"Catherine Howard\"/\"Catherine of Aragon,\" \"Jane Seymour,\" and \"The Recollection\"/\"Dance of a Thousand Lights.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lDRlY6ge3LTz1Qx2ySzSmW734gn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14785,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pinnacle Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2000-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rick Wakeman: Live in Concert","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
