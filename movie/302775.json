Highly stroboscopic and hallucinatory, these kinetic performances result in otherworldly spaces and plays of near-abstraction and suggestive imagery. In Krypton is Doomed, the audio accompaniment to the shifting visuals is an installment of a Superman radio play â€” the first ever broadcast, in 1940. This work highlights Jacobs' relentless experimentation with the very fabric of projected light.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6ZgQVU2gCnN5TTlSnXw90efZ33B.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Krypton Is Doomed","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
