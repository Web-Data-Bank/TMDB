Filming the passion and energy on both sides of the crash barriers was no mean feat. The light show was a blitzkrieg of lasers, pulsating strobes and relentless lashings of red beams cutting through the bursts of blue. Alabama 3 played for the crowd refused to compromise with colour balanced, TV friendly illumination.","popularity":1.342,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Film of Alabama 3's concert at the London Astoria, December 14 2004","title":"Alabama 3: Hear the Train a' Comin'","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
