Using a jar of sprouting Mung beans as a metaphor it takes into consideration contemporary manifestations of national borders as they relate to regional and international growth and movement. This video emerges from questions such as: Who gains access? How does water transform a space and its borders? Who can move freely and access resources? What moves in and out of a given space and the boundaries that attempt to demarcate and contain it?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GD","name":"Grenada"}],"release_date":"2014-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bottleneck","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":1}
