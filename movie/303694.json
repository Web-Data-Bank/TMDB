Astonished by the exotic flavor of the meat, the three men decide to buy Igor, a donkey, in order to eat him. Takeo, Hiroshi and Jun rejoice in their gastronomic project as they are passing though streets filled with wreaths, candles and other Christmas decorations in the Komoro City shopping area. But at the sight of a Nativity scene displayed in a shop window, doubt takes hold of them at the sight of the donkey next to the baby Jesus. Is the donkey sacred to Christians? Slaughtering the donkey for a gastronomic delight will be more complicated than expected! In an offset and falsely light mood, 'In search of a donkey' conveys our relationship to foreign religions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2011-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hunting ass","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":2}
