The action is over in a few seconds, and then another pair of fighters takes a turn, all the while reminded by the referee not to inflict hurt. An important match is coming up and the people in the village are backing their favourite, who spends his time in training with a Belgian coach, getting ready for the big day.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5oo4KjXMa8ORQWiAjW0IoIM3drO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38596,"logo_path":null,"name":"L'Office National du Cinema","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CG","name":"Congo"}],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wrestlers","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4}
