A sharply written and briskly directed satire of the acting and filmmaking professions that then turns into a hilarious wish-fulfillment fantasy, it also features a lovely lead performance by Mara Hobel (whom Joan Crawford-heads may recognize as the child Christina Crawford in Mommie Dearest) and funny supporting turns from more recognizable folks like Clancy Brown, Paige Turco and Peter Bogdanovich, along with a voice cameo from the late Don LaFontaine.","popularity":1.091,"poster_path":"/31vHgbQjh1ezoE5jQDEBrFvvA8K.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Claire Makes It Big","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
