Resembles Pudovkin's classic \"End of St. Petersburg,\" made 4 years earlier: backward lad (Poslavsky) from poor village comes to town desperate for work. He's hired as replacement (\"scab\") worker at big metallurgical factory, which is in the throes of a strike organized by the Bolsheviks (communists). The Bolshevik strikers are led by Ivan Shtraukh (brother of the more famous Russian actor Maxim Shtraukh). At first, the deceitful industrialist's son (Fedosev) involves the naive Poslavsky in an attempt to murder Shtraukh, but the attempt only wounds the heroic organizer.
