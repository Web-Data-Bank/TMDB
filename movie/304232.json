As they vividly recall details from their ordeal--from the perils of the amphibious assault to the invasion's gruesome aftermath--their testimony yields long-buried and often painful memories. They recount their transformations from boys to men, reveal their uneasiness with the term \"hero,\" and grapple with why they survived when so many others did not.","popularity":0.634,"poster_path":"/kBqBK6Ty1QRf2Sz0g38LcnBQdKe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":105676,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tim Gray Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Day of Days: June 6, 1944 - American Soldiers Remember D-Day","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
