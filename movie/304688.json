Then, suddenly, a rumor pops up that Grandfather Kreithofer is a rich man, who wants to leave his entire estate to his grandchild Lois.  Grandpa started the rumor to help his grandson out of the mess, who, as luck would (not) have it, is also in love with Haslinger’s daughter, Ev.  But no sooner does Haslinger hear of this rumor, that he wants the old man to move in with him, leave the debt to him and give permission for the kids to marry.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gIr9MYDk4pIgJTseklmpXzH4Ghg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1942-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der verkaufte Großvater","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
