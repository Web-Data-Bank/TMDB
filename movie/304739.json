She had been an ordinary woman working in a shop when she met the lively carpenter who married her, and their life together was without major problems. But now she is forced to raise her children under straitened circumstances, and after her husband dies, her life undergoes another major change as she marries for the second time. Underneath Colometa's acquiescent, forebearing exterior must lie just a few discontents, a few unrealized dreams - but they never surface as she blithely moves from one episode in her life to another.","popularity":0.622,"poster_path":"/tNE4y0ZdeBD2lFLjHfIOZ6PzJxc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1660,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fígaro Films","origin_country":""},{"id":981,"logo_path":"/pkrdO9ykplO4Zc8edikoSX5APUN.png","name":"TVE","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1982-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Català"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La plaça del diamant","video":false,"vote_average":6.563,"vote_count":8}
