On the way she is assaulted by the Marquess del Olmo and two mates who bring her to a brothel where they perpetrate the rape. With the father of Adriana claiming damages, the Marquess just offers him money because he asserts that she went there of her free will. The father rejects the money but he believes in the infamy of the Marquess and, wounded his honour, throws Adriana out. It is at the home of her old dance teacher that Adriana finds solace. Some months later, now a genuine artist, she leaves Spain for the distant shores of America. Under the name of Tórtola Valencia, Adriana becomes a famous dancer.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dLp5IvSjv0EsBYtb72QFzcKnC7z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95944,"logo_path":null,"name":"Condal Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1915-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pasionaria","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
