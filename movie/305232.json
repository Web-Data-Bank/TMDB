He's the ringmaster and snake charmer of Boylesque T.O., Canada's first all-male burlesque troupe. This talented group of dancers, actors, and performance artists has been busting their buns to put male nudity and sexuality back center-stage where it belongs. Their diversity and openness to different expressions of sexuality and body types is well renowned. A Boylesque show is guaranteed to leave you hot under the collar, howling with laughter, and screaming for more! Though his troupe is a mosaic of gay, bisexual and tri-anything - James is decidedly and (surprisingly!) straight. So just what lures a straight man into this world of wigs, sequins, and bawdy delights? Perhaps this Queen Bee likes having his own gay honey hive.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/e7WPTI1J2lxSZmaJFri0G1CmdDm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The real life magic men","title":"I'm a Stripper: Boylesque!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
