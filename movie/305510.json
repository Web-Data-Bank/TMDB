This release features Mayall in a hard-driving, sharp set of original and classic numbers captured live on tour in 1988. This concert serves to remind us of the genius with which this pioneering artist almost single-handedly revived the Blues, and how he has made them his own over a phenomenal career in music. Featuring the paired lead guitars of Walter Trout and Coco Montoya, the band rocks hard in a tight groove that enables searing solos from the featured guitarists as well as from Mayall himself on guitar and keyboards. The guttural power of Mayall's vocals is ever-present. And the songs - most of them Mayall originals - include the classic Room To Move, with which John Mayall once electrified the world of Rock 'n' Roll.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":39133,"logo_path":null,"name":"SWR TV Studio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1988-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Ohne Filter Extra","title":"John Mayall & The Bluesbreakers - Live In Germany","video":true,"vote_average":3.8,"vote_count":2}
