In a desperate attempt to get the kids to sleep, their father tells them a homespun bedtime story, an instant Christmas classic -- the story of Santa's little ferrets. Although very few people know it, it seems that Santa brings an elite security detail with him every Christmas Eve -- three highly trained ferrets. Their job? Make sure no one's awake, trying to catch a glimpse of Santa. But on this particular night the unexpected happens, and the line between fantasy and reality becomes blurred. Suddenly, the ferrets' entire security operation is in jeopardy!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qLJBPoDDptklPSXlAy6SXyl9VLR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house, not a creature was stirring - except for three little ferrets.","title":"Santa's Little Ferrets","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
