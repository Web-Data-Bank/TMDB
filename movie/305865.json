Bermudian, Major Toby Smith lost his life at the Battle of Overloon during the final Allied push for victory. This film weaves a haunting portrait etched in Tobys own words through the letters he lovingly and dutifully wrote his wife and five children as he agonized over loyalty to them and the war against the Nazis during four years of service abroad. This first hand account uniquely re-captures the war-time era and its impact on a family, leaving a lasting legacy of what it means to serve ones King and Country.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xPpiCxfkWvrbv4kEdaxY7uXHrAd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Hour of Victory","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
