A collaboration between Benjamin Gibbard (of Death Cab for Cutie) and Jimmy Tamborello (from Dntel), with Rilo Kiley’s Jenny Lewis, The Postal Service released Give Up, their one and only album, in 2003. That record went on to sell over a million copies and most of the band’s fans never had the chance to see them perform live.  In celebration of the 10-year anniversary of Give Up, the band reunited to tour the world. With intimate interviews and backstage footage of the band, Everything Will Change captures one of the nights when everything did change.","popularity":0.953,"poster_path":"/p7ABZqgfM7KItnfzCcIY8UtfP48.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10642,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Metropolitan Entertainment Group","origin_country":""},{"id":21205,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sub Pop Records","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Everything Will Change","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
