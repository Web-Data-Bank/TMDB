The credit sequence in which title cards show successively larger foetuses pulsating on the screen until the baby is born and cries.\r 2.) Etoile-directly referring to Cocteau, Lethem shows an adolescent sucking a starfish and then giving birth to a smaller starfish. A statement of inadequacy. To give birth involves an emasculation and a loss of vitality.\r 3.) Corps-two images of a man on a couch groping for each other, watched by a mysterious peeping Tom. As the two superimposed images come together, the heavy breathing subsides…the statement that the birth of desire is a self – realisation.\r 4.) Hymen – The decaying body of a girl is shot through green filters, and the final image reveals her vagina crawling with maggots and overlain with a crucifix. A representation of Catholicism preventing the free expression of desire.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1967-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les souffrances d'un oeuf meurtri","video":false,"vote_average":3.2,"vote_count":8}
