Filmmaker/stonemason. A tower or ruin of remembrance. With each swing of the hammer I cut into the image and the sound rises from the chisel. A rhythm, marked by repetition, and animated by variation; strokes of hammer and fist, resounding in dialogue. In this space which the film creates, emptiness gains a contour strong enough for the spectator to see more than the image â€“ a space permitting vision in addition to sight.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/kxhsIbHgEZHfDUkZ2CD5txa64U9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2001-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ground","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":11}
