The class field trip quickly becomes a grisly nightmare as the students and faculty soon discover they are stranded and the island is crawling with ravenous, flesh-eating ghouls, reanimated as Zombies by an insane Nazi scientist who can resurrect and control the dead. Just when the slaughter levels out, a three-headed abomination comes out of hiding that even its creator can't control. A head smashing, blood splattering, intestine eating throwback to the zombie films of the 70's and 80's. Welcome to ZOMBIE ISLE... A fieldtrip straight to Hell.","popularity":1.527,"poster_path":"/cPI7ASfQKucHctH2DKkXTQAm9we.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39495,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Eyesore Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Welcome to the Jungle","title":"Zombie Isle","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":5}
