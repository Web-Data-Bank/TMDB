Two political enemies are forced on a joint mission to write Zimbabwe's new constitution. The ultimate test that will either take the country a decisive step closer to democracy and away from President Mugabe's dictatorship, or toward renewed repression. In a country with little respect for human rights, impeded by economic sanctions and hyperinflation running rampant, failure is not an option.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jEhRNtki7HHrX3dNKqASUAmCrt8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48646,"logo_path":null,"name":"Upfront Films","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":75170,"logo_path":"/AiDruPS1BWcXNke9nuS4qxq9vHh.png","name":"Chicken \u0026 Egg Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":110842,"logo_path":"/dzFVNsYm8hihgjv9tZrQRPIn9Mf.png","name":"Tribeca Film Institute","origin_country":"US"},{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":2999,"logo_path":"/zGSqFee9aDgDuLD6vcs2mcJUem4.png","name":"SVT","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"ZW","name":"Zimbabwe"}],"release_date":"2014-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Shona","iso_639_1":"sn","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Be seen as a man of peace.
