Unfortunately Leslie soon gets divorced by her husband and is deeply immersed in sorrow. With Yat-tong's company, she breaks away from the sad history and starts her new life. They get along so well that obviously they are turning to be something more than friends, at least everyone around expects that would happen sooner or later. Maybe just a matter of time. However, they have a large barrier. Leslie's ex-husband is the elder brother of Yat-tong. That means, they are indeed ex-in-laws. Truly, this is not just a matter of time then.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gcCpS2fzHFVdJ3B2riZv6w06i5U.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2009-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Give Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
