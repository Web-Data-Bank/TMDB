Революція","overview":"Whilst the first shots ring out between pro-Russian government forces and members of the opposition in the winter of 2013, young Nina leaves Crimea. She was raped by a corrupt policeman, her friend was killed, and now she seeks refuge with the protesters on Maidan Square. Revolutionary chaos prevails, and it‘s not at all clear who remains loyal to whom and which means can be regarded as legitimate in the struggle for freedom. Ultimately Nina and her tormentors come face to face again and the spiral of violence is stepped up a further notch. The film was shot to a genuine backdrop, the result of which is a multifaceted allegory on the tragedy currently playing out in the Ukraine.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/gSsuc8ZyUcWYEbDgDGNESdeUSC0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2014-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Once upon a time in Ukraine","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
