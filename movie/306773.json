She finds employment as a maid for a nasty woman, who seems to be in a persistently vengeful mood and showers her with verbal and physical abuse. Rather coincidentally, Ainiâ€™s boyfriend Ramlan (Ali Rahman) happens to be the brother-in-law of the abusive employer. Aini confides her sorrows to Ramlan, who clearly identifies with her grim view of life, being unemployed and in a pretty forlorn state himself. Nonetheless, Ramlan is from a middle-class background  and his proposal to marry Aini, who is considered socially inferior, is met with outright disapproval.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/puJNG2tRE6IHHNXk68dTQcYKzRh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27155,"logo_path":null,"name":"Malay Film Productions Ltd.","origin_country":"SG"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MY","name":"Malaysia"}],"release_date":"1953-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malay","iso_639_1":"ms","name":"Bahasa melayu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hati Iblis","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
