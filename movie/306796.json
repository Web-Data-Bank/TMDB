Turner walks us through Loy's career as a dancer and an actress miscast as an exotic. She comes into her own as a grown-up women: shrewd, funny, decorous, and sexy - in \"Manhattan Melodrama\" and \"The Thin Man.\" Her volunteer work during World War II, later stage work, and progressive politics come in for admiration as well. It's her style - seen best in her roles as a wife of charm and independence - that's captured and celebrated here.","popularity":2.498,"poster_path":"/oqaGTH6kawaIi7qO17pB5UyvZPY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":678,"logo_path":"/AbIc38dGx4b8dhKS7oeRL6aXFDv.png","name":"Turner Network Television","origin_country":"US"},{"id":14773,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lorac Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":1765,"logo_path":"/oqMb5Xwbvvle7riett66WbI06fQ.png","name":"Turner Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1990-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Witty, warm, sexy and sophisticated.","title":"Myrna Loy: So Nice to Come Home To","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":2}
