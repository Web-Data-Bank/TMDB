She and hubby Gustav exchanged their passionate relationship for a permanent seize-fire. The once uninhibited and vibrant journalist is now just a few fading photographs on the wall. And then, her world is shattered when Gustav apparently starts an affair with the very big investor who just might be the savior of his company – Elzaan Mostert.  Enter Helena’s alter ego, the can-do, let’s-make-a-plan, nothing-is-impossible younger version of herself. Alter Ego comes up with the idea of starting a blog called Alles wat Mal is (Everything Crazy), documenting Helena’s hectic life, and her quest to win back Gustav’s affection, and put a spark back into her marriage.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/27zqaX69szioa9wkkXHvhW2XVib.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39813,"logo_path":null,"name":"Karoo Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2014-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Afrikaans","iso_639_1":"af","name":"Afrikaans"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alles Wat Mal Is","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":2}
