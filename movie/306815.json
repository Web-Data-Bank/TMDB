Nobody knew him – only his music was well known. The life of Strock is like a side-show of everlasting debts, long voyages and wild and unlucky love affairs that find their best interpretation through his tango music. The piano player is a man, who barely arranges his life according to the political and economic circumstances in the world. To earn money, he plays for pubs and cinema theatres in Riga, Berlin and Paris, and for lovers, he writes the most romantic tango music.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sUE5dwaTFhryzRiL1pOL3hVN47J.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":63707,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kinolats","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2014-06-03","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Piano Player","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
