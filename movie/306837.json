The film blends documentary and fictional genres in a musical structure to tell the story of the birth of a nation and the ideals of secularism and tolerance on which it was founded. The filmmakers combined footage of the cultural troupe and their activities, shot by American filmmaker Lear Levin in 1971, with historic footage collected from archives around the world, to create “Muktir Gaan” (Song of Freedom).","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/52160osGEJqzntOryEPb0cFByDH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":163467,"logo_path":null,"name":"Audiovision","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BD","name":"Bangladesh"}],"release_date":"1995-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Song of Freedom","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
