Fluoridation was first advanced in the US at the end of the second World War. Proponents argued that fluoride in water and toothpaste would help to protect teeth and prevent decay. Over the following decades, fluoride was added to public water supplies across the country.  While the benefits of fluoridation have been held to be unquestionable, accumulating evidence points to a frightening prospect: that fluoride may have serious adverse health effects, including infant mortality, congenital defects and IQ.  \"The Fluoride Deception\" by Christopher Bryson examines the background of the fluoridation debate. According to Bryson, research challenging fluoride's safety was either suppressed or not conducted in the first place. He says fluoridation is a triumph not of medical science but of US government spin.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3qEYnJcreQCtetAwlbyc1fUkZ6r.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fluoride Deception","video":true,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
