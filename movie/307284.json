On this day the local farmers bring their animals to the church – cows, horses, dogs, cats, chickens, rabbits – to be blessed. This ancient tradition is passed from generation to generation, and today, just as hundreds of years ago, animals and people flock up the mountain roads to the church square to become a part of the religious festival. The film is about this miracle.","popularity":0.843,"poster_path":"/96CWzgJtWPYiyWkULUZvJaNKN4U.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19166,"logo_path":null,"name":"Agência da Curta Metragem","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2012-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Miracle of Saint Anthony","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":5}
