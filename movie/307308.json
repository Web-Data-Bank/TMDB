However, Benoît is endowed with amazing force. All the bandits who cross his path learn this to their own cost. But, unfortunately, no one is perfect... As soon as he catches a cold, Benoît loses his extraordinary physical abilities. Hence he never takes off the woollen scarf wrapped around his neck. Brave and very determined, he doesn't hesitate a second to take action to defend his friends. So, when Poilonez - a well known crook - and his gang decide to focus on Mr. Dussiflard, his taxi driver friend, Benoît does all that he can to thwart his plans.","popularity":2.592,"poster_path":"/99IzfwKz33m3bga7tCIzhobhylc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12961,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lambart Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2014-12-17","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Benedict Ironbreaker: The Red Taxis","video":false,"vote_average":4.6,"vote_count":26}
