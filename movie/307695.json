But Mother won't go, and their own lives quickly unravel as she clings to life. Director Daisy Jacobs uses two-metre-high painted characters in full-size sets to tell the stark and darkly humorous tale of caring for an elderly relative. The Bigger Picture is quite simply the most innovative animated short you will see this year.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/qdlrC3LDx1plsiXbiDhsFXg4duq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17700,"logo_path":"/30KETxKJcX7cm65WymAKMYPP6C4.png","name":"NFTS","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Bigger Picture","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":18}
