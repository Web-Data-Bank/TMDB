The stage is small and the beautifully elegant and this shining production by Michael Hampe, recorded in May 1989, provides one and a half hours of the entertaining story about \"the son won in a game\" as it is subtitled. The staging transfers to the screen perfectly and the cast of principals, led by Alessandro Corbelli, Alberto Rinaldi and Amelia Felle provide musical excellence together with the flexible Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra under Gianluigi Gelmetti.","popularity":1.34,"poster_path":"/qifoiWxQPKIAA0LFN7HUWxl2ovc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88824,"logo_path":null,"name":"De Agostini","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1989-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Il signor Bruschino","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
