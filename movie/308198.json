They find some hope when the drug addled Gonzo Kapoor, the son of a famous B movie producer, hires them to write an art house film billed as \"Tarkovsky with orgies\" for his directorial debut. All seems well until Dulal meets Ruma, a beautiful photographer who makes him question his choice to sell out, and the two friends must choose between friendship, love and the chance of a big break. The film delves into the world of young migrant writers, their hopes and their ontological anxiety.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Writers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
