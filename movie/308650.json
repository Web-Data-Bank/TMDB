They are led by a formidable and deeply religious ex-nurse whose destiny in life is to find these ‘lost souls’ and raise them in her colony. Through religious teachings and rituals adapted from Catholicism, and the occasional visit to local towns for blood, she prepares the children for what God had in mind for them… creation of a new race of men through ‘natural cloning’, which amounts to being bitten by her children. However, they are neither the only colony of their kind, nor are they as secluded from the outside world as they think.","popularity":0.926,"poster_path":"/8wKqqujJZxHa74AS26a3us2NmX5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12573,"logo_path":null,"name":"Noel Films","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2014-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"They've already begun...","title":"Children of the Night","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":16}
