A Chinese road movie, Walking on the Wild Side charts a young gang’s continuous flights from one kind of trouble to the next. Mirroring the stark and barren landscape, the film relays the grim story of these delinquents’ dreams of liberty and easy money. Played by nonprofessional actors who are real life troublemakers, the film offers a realism that is at once oppressive, cruel, and sympathetic.","popularity":1.163,"poster_path":"/uSbSKI6ETEnqwposr9O5VceV3u1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1079,"logo_path":null,"name":"Xstream Pictures","origin_country":"CN"},{"id":62611,"logo_path":"/x46MyEpQNWE23m6oDpTgxNwpt53.png","name":"Les Petites Lumieres","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2006-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Walking on the Wild Side","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":7}
