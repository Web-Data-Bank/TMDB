Chris starts to remember his carefree youth as a photographer in Paris when he lived with and enjoyed a torrid affair with Annick. It was also in Paris that he first met and fell in love with Marion. The temptations and pressure exerted on Chris by Toni to return to their former carefree life of sex, drugs and rock'n'roll soon starts to have an impact on Chris's marriage. He starts to question his values, his lifestyle choices and his relationship with Marion and even suspects her of starting an affair with Toni whom she dislikes! Eventually circumstances come to a head and Chris is forced to decide whether to follow Toni back to the hedonistic, irresponsible life of his youth or face the harsh realities of the present and stay with Marion.","popularity":4.032,"poster_path":"/qUFYBfOY3Ec2S6PR6apgFwfR6je.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":393,"logo_path":"/48DbAqzDc1ivGZrwGG2UAR70c0W.png","name":"MACT Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":718,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arts Council of England","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":30225,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blue Horizon Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":850,"logo_path":"/aF7qajGJGtMpdrtvssM9g90YanX.png","name":"Eurimages","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":30226,"logo_path":null,"name":"European Co-production Fund","origin_country":""},{"id":11943,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filman√≠a S.L.","origin_country":""},{"id":288,"logo_path":"/aW0IpM9d4Zjj978EqgDVSxXXhTj.png","name":"BBC Film","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1997-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's not a place, it's a state of mind.","title":"Metroland","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":39}
