Through candid interviews with doctors and scientists representing both sides of the issue and HIV positives on and off the drugs, the film opens minds and much-needed dialogue. Informative without being instructive, it raises fundamental questions about what we think we know. Its surprising and sometimes shocking revelations inspire us to take a closer look at HIV and AIDS and the systems that support our current views.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/luAIxxP6A6URFwIssd4sOtrZt3U.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95769,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hazel Wood Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"How Positive are You?","title":"The Other Side of AIDS","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
