With the children's constant bickering, pretty packages and a sweet-smelling tree don't come close to filling the McDonald home with the true spirit of the first Christmas.  Then Mom remembers an old tradition of building a soft bed for Baby Jesus one straw at a time.  Each time someone secretly does something nice for another family member, he or she gets to add a single straw to the manager.  Soon the children's quarreling and negative feelings subside and the homemade crib fills with straw.  But for one family member, a required act of kindness becomes more than he can take.  Inspired by a true story with both heart and humor.  The Last Straw may forever change the way your family celebrates Christmas.","popularity":1.551,"poster_path":"/r4AzKQEi5oisyeQNWU3dOrgUQOk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":157938,"logo_path":null,"name":"Disciple Cinema Group","origin_country":""},{"id":176675,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rob Diamond Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Finding the Christmas Spirit one Piece at a Time","title":"The Last Straw","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
