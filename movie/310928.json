But most men think of them as machos, as does charming big business Mike Badon. She expresses this bluntly and thus puts the success of their agency on the line. The widowed Mike is intrigued by the idiosyncratic Linda. When it sparks between the two, however, the attractive Susanne Badon appears. Since Linda misses the supposedly faithless Mike the pass. Linda only realizes that Susanne is Mike's younger sister when it's almost too late.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/j5JBja1zEsaD3AdHjtJC0p2eLho.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23586,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zieglerfilm Köln","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1999-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Männer sind wie Schokolade","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
