When three generations of the Slaters - Kat, Little Mo, Lynn, Zoe and Mo - go up town, it could only really end with a night in a police cell. But straight out of the disco, the fiery Slater girls - dressed in school uniforms - are far too hot for the local constabulary to handle.  With time on their hands they have an opportunity to look back on their lives; Mo's bust-ups, Lynn's altercations at the altar, Kat's confrontation with her past, Little Mo's nightmare with evil Trevor and a cauldron of steamy romances. When not flirting with the night sergeant, they give the inside story on the Slater highs and lows; the passion, the heartbreak, the fights and laughter of a family that doesn't know the meaning of the phrase \"The quiet life.\"","popularity":0.949,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3164,"logo_path":"/h06QVxWESaOAfBwkgrWFdbkkccq.png","name":"BBC Worldwide","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2003-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"EastEnders, Soap","title":"Eastenders: The Slaters In Detention","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
