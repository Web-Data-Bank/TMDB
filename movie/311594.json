From a Komodo dragon's virulent bacterial bite to a black widow spider poisoning her victim and a cobra devouring a rat (tail first), viewers get to see skin-crawling close-ups of Mother Nature's creepiest critters. Intriguing tidbits about each creature make the program as enlightening as it is hair-raising.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-08-22","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"National Geographic Kids: Creepy Creatures","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
