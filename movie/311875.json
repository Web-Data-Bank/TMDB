Director Laurent Pelly's interpretation, which premiered at Glyndebourne in 2008, finds Hansel, Gretel and their family taking shelter in a cardboard box while the witch's stock of goodies lines the shelves of a supermarket.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/AuXfHf7d05dPWszSr0SrylUqIwZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18872,"logo_path":"/9PNdO6L1bh8ZVjIwOKjveRia3Ku.png","name":"Decca","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Humperdinck: Hansel und Gretel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
