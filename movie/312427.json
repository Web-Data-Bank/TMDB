Dawn's struggle with her past is played out not only upon the couch during regression therapy but also within the family home. With the help of Josh's method of escapism; a penchant for viewing life through a lens, we learn from his footage the extent and impact this situation has had over the years. Vulnerable and unable to articulate their worries, teenagers Josh &amp; Nicola struggle with their mum's more recent bout of outbursts and her increasing instability. They forge relationships outside of the family unit; to escape in Nicola's case and for support whilst they try to maintain some sense of a 'normal' existence. As relationships at home become frayed, suspicions about Dawn's therapist's integrity &amp; motivations arise. Dawn is sectioned and social services are informed.","popularity":1.173,"poster_path":"/t8UdFKGxighK2m3Xb7tbpBQtAwn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15146,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lemfilms","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Celluloid","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":5}
