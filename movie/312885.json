During the night, the figurine comes alive and starts masturbating frantically. Bruno thinks he dreamed it, but the next day the doll speaks and tells her story. She was an au pair for a provincial nobleman who introduced her to the pleasures of the flesh. She was exchanged for another magician girl whose sexual performance had seduced the count.
