Leonie finds herself attracted to Leon, a Belgian who was a mercenary in Katanga in 1964, wounded and carrying psychological scars as well. The other men continually play practical jokes on Leon, some of them cruel. As Leon courts Leonie, his horrid mother brings him emotional distress as do his memories of war. Can the two of them get past these obstacles?","popularity":0.874,"poster_path":"/gwbRWqby10F83CkkDiWHSKLUAya.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1612,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ciné Vog Films","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"1972-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Franz","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":7}
