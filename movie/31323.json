In-between long hours waiting for a celebrity to emerge from a restaurant or a hotel, boredom immediately switches to fast action as the cameras click and roll when the person appears. The reaction to the gaggle of photographers is as varied as the people they often literally chase all around town. While some of the celebrities, such as Jacques Chirac who was mayor of Paris at the time, are perceived as comical caricatures, others are shown simply going about ordinary pursuits - including Catherine Deneuve, Gene Kelly, and Jean-Luc Godard.","popularity":0.618,"poster_path":"/mDdAb7E2ayhpwJfZr5EPTClGrbG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78976,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bibliothèque publique d'information du centre Georges Pompidou","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1981-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reporters","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":7}
