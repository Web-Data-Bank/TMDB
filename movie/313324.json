His character is a daydreamer but he manages to get caught up in an adventure involving the hugely underated Imogen Hassall. There is even an appearance from a pre Darth Vader Dave Prowse although his character closer resembles the one he played in 'Callan'.","popularity":1.366,"poster_path":"/mVXXynrHJnxbwDSJRNOQU9x4XQB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20818,"logo_path":null,"name":"Border Film Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1973-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"White Cargo","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":5}
