Led by the inexperienced and idealistic sous-lieutenant Torrens, fresh out of the military academy, and by adjutant Willsdorf, a WWII veteran of the Werhmacht, the group must cross 150 kilometers of jungle. But dripping rainwater, hostile nature, and the Viêt-minh ambushes expose them to constant danger.","popularity":3.69,"poster_path":"/8mQIn1FMnwEyPiMMrYVf0R0HcJE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rome Paris Films","origin_country":""},{"id":9185,"logo_path":null,"name":"Producciones Benito Perojo","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1965-03-31","revenue":306505,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Vietnamese","iso_639_1":"vi","name":"Tiếng Việt"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The 317th Platoon","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":58}
