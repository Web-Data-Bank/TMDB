Kathleen works in a factory and its owner, Donald Holiday (Warner Baxter), has taken a shine to her. But instead she falls for slick cab driver Harry Stanton (George Webb), who insists, \"Honest, kid, you're the only girl I ever loved.\" Kathleen falls for this, and when her perceptive father makes clear he doesn't approve of Stanton, she moves out on her own.","popularity":0.841,"poster_path":"/wGch7oSKQvRfz72CsMVp6Kt06C5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":40454,"logo_path":null,"name":"Realart Pictures Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1921-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"First Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
