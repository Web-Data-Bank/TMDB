Witness our prehistoric ancestors as they clash with a completely different species of humans, the Neanderthals, some 30,000 years ago in Ice Age Europe. Neanderthals, stocky, powerful and able to tolerate intense pain versus their foes, the Cro-Magnons, weaker and more fragile but with a superior brain. Cutting-edge archaeological and anthropological research, including data from the ongoing Neanderthal genome mapping project at Germany's Max Planck Institute, lends up-to-the-minute realism and accuracy to this cataclysmic fight to the finish.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":8376,"logo_path":null,"name":"A\u0026E Home Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Clash of the Cave Men","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
