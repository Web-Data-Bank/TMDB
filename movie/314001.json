Just to see desire. An example of this is Erotique. One sees swirling pictures, parts of a woman’s face, red lips, eyes in cyclical fragments of movement. Often it is difficult to tell which part of the body one actually sees (whoever wants to can see/imagine/think sexual organs and sexual acts.) The gaze gets hung up on partial objects, no integral, whole body to think about. No body, whose representation was always one of the problems in cinema.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/d5kw7sqBC0Fwk3UQth4WzJbrnxo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1982-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Erotique","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":8}
