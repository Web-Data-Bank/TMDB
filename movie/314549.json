But each of these transformations also plays on those of their performers, thus giving a new twist to Ovid’s Metamorphoses, written before and during his exile from the Roman Empire, and questioning the role of gender and identity in our society.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love and Metamorphoses","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":4}
