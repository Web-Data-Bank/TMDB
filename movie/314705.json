Her attempts faced stiff opposition from the organisers and society. However, she persisted as she was determined to represent Emirati women in this largely male bastion and keen on proving to the world that her gender would not hold her back. An inspiring film about a woman’s courage and pioneering spirit.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cotnFBzZI2tCwXkAUBsEJB3nwER.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AE","name":"United Arab Emirates"}],"release_date":"2014-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nearby Sky","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
