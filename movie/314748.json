Yet, on-field competition would pale in comparison to the hurdles the Aggies had already overcome to make the move. In exclusive interviews, SEC Ready, the first feature film from TexAgs Films, recounts the politics, negotiations and broken promises that led A&amp;M to the SEC. Once there, the Aggies defied doubters, went toe-to-toe with college footballâ€™s elite and proved they were SEC Ready.","popularity":0.9,"poster_path":"/6HiGruJmXpv5xpc6frOM2ekVRAS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42495,"logo_path":null,"name":"TexAgs Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A 100-year decision 100 years in the making.","title":"SEC Ready","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
