With rarely seen footage from the 1920s through 1950s, these extraordinary stories illustrate the birth of the Negro Leagues and depict both the struggles endured and milestones achieved by its players. The film also highlights Negro League innovations that helped shape modern day baseball, such as the Leagues' usage of portable light towers to enable games to be played after dusk for the first time ever","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/efHJRJ1CyEE7aVHu7GrVwoRIGPn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134368,"logo_path":null,"name":"MLB Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pride and Perseverance: The Story of the Negro Leagues","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
