Deep pillows and Alaskan spines, all filmed at night, with massive lights, custom made LED suits, and a national governments worth of logistics, planning, and civil engineering. Filmed as a partnership between Sweetgrass Productions, Philips TV, and the Swedish Agency Ahlstrand & WÃ¥llgren, it's two parts creativity, one part branded content, and a pinch of masochism for good measure. Overall, it's an incredibly unique partnership between our vision of skiing and the color and light technology behind the Philips Ambilight TV.","popularity":0.905,"poster_path":"/boRgloB7H7icWLgiDyrdc90FRdl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19469,"logo_path":"/9J7UPjnJ0AanK0BJLYKmikrVUS1.png","name":"Sweetgrass Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Afterglow","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":2}
