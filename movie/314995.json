He decides that after this job, he will renounce his profession and turn himself in. This is the first feature film from Taiwanese director Alex Yang, who participated in script-writing and production on Edward Yang's early films. \"The Trigger\" has echoes of Yang's \"Mahjong.\" The actors in the film, except for veteran Ngai Man-Yin, are all new faces -- unfortunately, Ngai's death in 2005 also made \"The Trigger\" his last appearance on screen.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/24I9CPk20hq9wPRJ56hvTZWYikO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2002-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Trigger","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
