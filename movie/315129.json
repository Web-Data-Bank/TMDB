In addition to her passion for her teacher, Maria also becomes involved with a young orchestra conductor, who ends up being wounded in a duel with her ex-fiancé. In the end, however, Maria and the musician are reunited as she plays a Liszt concerto under his direction. A German-language version of Szerelmi Almok was filmed simultaneously with a different cast.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"1935-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dreams of Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
