She has kept her terminal diagnosis secret from everyone around her, her housekeeper and gardener, as well as her estranged son, Justin. As her health continues to decline, her doctor insists it is time to bring in a live-in nurse at home. Stubbornly proud, Norma rejects every candidate for the job straight away. That is until she comes across Emma Keating, who refuses to take no for an answer and whole-heartedly agrees to keep Normaâ€™s secret.","popularity":2.75,"poster_path":"/cMN1k1RrKDNP0MsuAZbKiE9Nlqf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3282,"logo_path":null,"name":"Larry Levinson Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Touched","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":10}
