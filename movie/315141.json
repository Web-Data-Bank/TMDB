In addition to facing poverty, deprivation, and prejudice, the immigrants are also bedeviled by a raging fever epidemic. Finally achieving a measure of prosperity, the Italians are forced to confront tragedy once more when their grown children march off to WWI. Though Isa Miranda is top-billed, she has very little to do in comparison with male lead Filippo Scelso. Passaporto Rosso was released in the U.S. as Destiny Unknown.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oQALaq4pUUbAwpYsx2rQq2gxNlr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1935-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Destiny Unknown","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
