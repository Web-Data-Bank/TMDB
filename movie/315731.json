While she's in the throne room awaiting him, he's outside playing with guns, drilling his soldiers, and dallying with the wife of a new minister. The queen catches him kissing her, her husband figures out that something fishy is going on, and the king tries his best to proceed with his plans for a night out. The queen contrives to keep him cuffed in the bedroom: king, queen, minister, and coquette end up in a game of musical beds. Will his royal highness get his night out?","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/cyHYDdd3oqfZy5SW4taWzvsmvsW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hal Roach Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1930-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The King","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
