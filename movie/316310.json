People go in and out of caf√©s, and lively conversation echoes all around. As if no one expects the NATO bombings. As if they never even started. But there is tension nonetheless, behind the eyes of people who suppress their fear at any cost. It is in this time and place that Ana, Sloba and Bojan construct their own sense of normality in order to retain their sanity. Three ways to deal with fear. One random sky above.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/r6zbCMdThKbpmyFT5gsFZVdcqbc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3984,"logo_path":"/pvOBu9K0zTRuwJW7WII34x17kdz.png","name":"Entre Chien et Loup","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":43456,"logo_path":null,"name":"CTM LEV Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"},{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2015-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sky Above Us","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
