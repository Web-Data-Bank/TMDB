Martin packs up his things, finds a small room for rent, and takes up his professor’s investigation of Temple Wood. However, he soon finds that his professor’s disappearance may be related to ancient druid practices and some very dark happenings within these highlands. As Martin explores, he finds that he finds himself digging deep into his own emotions and if he is ever allowed to leave these highlands – he will never be the same again.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wKNloJYPlb6Dyx2rvY5TTz25fY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98181,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kinonation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2012-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Temple Wood: A Quest for Freedom","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
