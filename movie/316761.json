But beneath Crimmins’ gruff, hard-drinking, curmudgeonly persona lay an undercurrent of rage stemming from his long-suppressed and horrific abuse as a child – a rage that eventually found its way out of the comedy clubs and television shows and into the political arena.","popularity":4.393,"poster_path":"/eewB9ORnDZsxPoJiTKCcZMocm1p.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21207,"logo_path":"/bhgVefS8V22TxYn9pcIpAZjunrx.png","name":"Type 55 Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Call Me Lucky","video":false,"vote_average":7.011,"vote_count":47}
