Now both are adults and are attracted to each other. Gayetri, who lives a middle-class lifestyle with her dad, Badri, and mom, Satyavati, in Madhavpur, is soon married to Vijay, but realizes that he is an atheist, while she is a devout Hindu, and worshiper of Lord Shiv, and it was perhaps for this reason that their marriage ceremony was marred by several accidents, including Vijay being mauled by a runaway buffalo, and a fire breaking out at the Mandap itself. Remake of Na Ninna Bidalare (Vijay, 1979).","popularity":0.62,"poster_path":"/wkjmgM2yzzDcDn0ycv5V4n1Crbe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1981-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":139,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sacred Golden Chain","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
