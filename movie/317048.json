Quoting from a catalogue of popular styles and sources, from TV commercials to The Wizard of Oz, the Yonemotos construct a parable of the Hollywood image-making industry from a pastiche of narrative cliches: A small-town ingenue goes West to find her dream and loses her innocence; the patriarch of a Hollywood studio nears death; a New York couple seeks screenwriting fame and fortune in the movies. With deadpan humor and hyperbolic visual stylization, the Yonemotos layer artifice upon artifice, constructing an image-world where reality and representation, truth and simulation, are meaningless distinctions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2FOmQz2OxBQBEesqRwX3ad6w2yX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":43704,"logo_path":null,"name":"KYO-DAI","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Made in Hollywood","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
