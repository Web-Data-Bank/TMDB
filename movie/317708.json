Instead, he opts to celebrate by planting flowers in his garden. Unfortunately, he goes to a fireworks stand instead of a flower stand and purchases some fireworks thinking them to be flowers. He even plants them in his garden, no less! Of course, they are eventually set off with a series of explosions, Waldo panicking the whole time. After the fiasco, Magoo decides to soothe Waldo's panic by letting him set off one firecracker after which Waldo is sent to a jail by a policeman who accuses him of starting the fireworks catastrophe.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1957-07-24","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Magoo's Glorious Fourth","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
