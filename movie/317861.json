But in reality, he's broke, living out of his van, $93,000 in debt and still looking for the ever-elusive purpose of his life. Pop, an elderly friend from the past, offers Victor his only choice - to come back home. Through the story's inspiring ending of reconciled relationships and realized dreams, we are reminded that no life is \"common\" - and that everyone has a God-given purpose.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Redemption Of The Commons","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
