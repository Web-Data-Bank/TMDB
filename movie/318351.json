A very entertaining 90 minutes indeed! It's full of the typical European goofy humor and even features a quick dance number once one Russian military captain, the beautiful Christina Penz, defects and makes it across the border into Austria! My favorite moment involves a camera doubles for a hand torch AND rotary saw!! I am sure Q was taking notes! Super fun happy time it is and I highly recommend!","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/v21Rs71zk15ekLInc5CYMBs6nuo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97731,"logo_path":null,"name":"Miro Cinematografica","origin_country":""},{"id":11203,"logo_path":null,"name":"Centauro Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1967-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mission Phantom","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
