Revealing the unknown stars and lost masterpieces, he brings to life the pioneering techniques and optical inventiveness of the virtuosos who mastered a new art form. With a playful eye and comic sense of timing, Merton combines the role of presenter and director to recreate the weird and wonderful world that is early European cinema in a series of cinematic experiments of his own.","popularity":0.873,"poster_path":"/hZtjPFlPk0J1s3H0FPtfnzfYg3S.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31272,"logo_path":"/kJU4FbsNy58061t5313VKpfksh5.png","name":"BBC Bristol Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2010-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paul Merton's Weird and Wonderful World of Early Cinema","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
