It doesn't help that he works as a nightwatchman, and that she has left a satisfying job teaching music to children to follow him, and is now out of work. During his endless nocturnal rounds with his lively colleague, Tom, Zeno meet a pretty Romanian waitress, Ela, and begins a flirtation that eventually leads to a passionate kiss. As expected, Zeno and Rossana's relationship deteriorates even further, and not even the news that Rossana is expecting their child can help them reconnect.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'ultima foglia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
