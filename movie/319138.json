A young boy lives with his grandmother in a city where people use small airplanes to get from place to place. He drives a taxi plane, and during one of his travels he bumps into a bird that has been shot by the boy's latest customer. The bird, as well as a hungry bear he meets next, offer him a reward for his help.
