Looking more like a mellow, mid-life surfer than hairy rock icon from the 1980s, the ever-expansive Hagar leads the Waboritas through a long, hot 2002 tour, sharing a bill with David Lee Roth, Hagar's co-outcast from Van Halen. Despite their shared ignominy, Roth rebuffs Hagar's efforts at collaboration, or at least camaraderie, resulting in a competitive and entertainingly catty atmosphere.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Long Road to Cabo","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":1}
