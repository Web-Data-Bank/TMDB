His mother was a dog too. George made different sounds, which made his mother take him to the vet/veterinarian. A veterinarian/vet will take an animal's health and temperatures. The vet said \"Please bark, George\" every single time after George's mother went on very desperate. Which was a reference to when George made strange sounds a dog doesn't say, George's mother tells before it happens, \"No, George. A ___ goes \"___\". A dog goes \"arf!\" Now bark, George.\" Good thing George said the right thing. But before it happened, the vet put on his latex gloves and pulled out the animals.","popularity":0.883,"poster_path":"/xdgeDWMFEJHDFpgeaZ5mVKiNapO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13636,"logo_path":null,"name":"Weston Woods Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bark, George","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
