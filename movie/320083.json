The fights are sudden snorting seesaws, explosions of mass and muscle, archaic and wild spectacles. We follow three concurrent story lines: an anxious farmer with his beloved contender, a neurotic unemployed reporter from Zurich coming to find a story, and a gang of adolescent boys on mopeds trying to catch a pretty girl's eye. The festival is a balancing act between fascinating tradition and modernity. This black and white film serves as both an exciting visual treat and a long overdue documentation of a fascinating Swiss tradition.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cI5qbaPASgZxesjnJmOkPSdkUra.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Battle of the Queens","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
