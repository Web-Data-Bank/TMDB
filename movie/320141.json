He was a beloved Capuchin Friar who many believe had the ability to heal the sick and prophesize the future. Stories abound of how Solanus' prayers made miracles happen. He was a role model for his time and continues to be so for people today, which is why he has become a candidate for Sainthood. Solanus Casey was born in 1870 on a Wisconsin farm to Irish immigrant parents. He had a very religious upbringing, along with 15 brothers and sisters, two of whom died during the Diphtheria Epidemic.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2dqkv34sOcXqoW0M0GuIeh6S5A7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Healing Prophet: Solanus Casey","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
