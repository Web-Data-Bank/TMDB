The story begins when a gang of dangerous convicts escape from a penal colony. With the police in hot pursuit, the escapees cut a gory swath through the countryside. As his comrades are killed off one by one, the leader of the group descends into gibbering madness. In contrast to this, a subplot develops involving the least dangerous of the escapees, who murdered his wife in a peak of self-righteous rage and is now seriously in doubt about the wisdom of his deed.  Principal scenes reworked in 1962 to make the film The Violent and the Damned (q.v.).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/e1gHH5kt7yOjW82btQzXY8OCR1f.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14537,"logo_path":null,"name":"Maristela","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"1962-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mãos Sangrentas","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
