One of the most successful of these was her 1955 film version of Mussorgsky and Pushkin's Boris Godunov. Stroyeva's adaptation deftly streamlines the story of a Russian czar whose life is placed in jeopardy by a pretender to his throne. A. Pirogov sings the title role, while G. Nellep provides vocal and visual menace as the \"False Dmitri\". The use of a color process known as Magicolor adds just the right touch of theatrical artificiality to the pomp-and-splendor proceedings.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7fV2ctIM3D5tRnBEVOzsNLvUkWJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1954-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boris Godunov","video":false,"vote_average":2.2,"vote_count":4}
