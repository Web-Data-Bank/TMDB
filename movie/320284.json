At the time of its release, there was much controversy in the documentary-filmmaking world over the fact that the Aussies signed over exclusive distribution rights to a French firm, resulting in a boycott from other movie companies. None of this matters when the film is seen today: though not in the same league as Leni Reifenstahl's Olympiad, this 110-minute extravaganza is consistently entertaining. Fifteen cameras were utilized to lens every aspect of the event; it was then up to editors Jean Dudrumet and Monique Lacombe to burrow through miles and miles of film to cull the highlights seen herein. Portions of Rendez-Vous a Melbourne have since resurfaced in practically every Olympics documentary -- not to mention the many TV specials attending the now-biannual event.","popularity":0.745,"poster_path":"/1pizJ0K6U1QEwgl9zBmbWZdFHvB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":99323,"logo_path":null,"name":"Productions CSA","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1957-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Melbourne Rendezvous","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":5}
