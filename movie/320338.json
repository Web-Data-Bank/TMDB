What truly brings us happiness? What are the essential problems facing our world today, and how can we solve them? What is at the heart and soul of the cultural Hungry Ghosts that seek happiness and fulfillment through money and things, instead of from within? In this inspiring and thought-provoking film, 'Compassion in Action', the Dalai Lama and some of the most innovative and revolutionary thinkers of our time explore the sources of unhappiness and happiness in our world. This film is a deeper exploration of the ideas presented in the internationally successful documentary film 'Dalai Lama Awakening' (narrated by actor Harrison Ford), directed by award-winning Producer-Director Khashyar Darvich.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/stX5f026d3ZdP4FY2DYxhLlMIaD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Compassion in Action","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
