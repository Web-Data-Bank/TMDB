Shot mockumentary style, this short film follows two young couples in opposite stages of romance: Matt and Willa, who have been hooking up for six days, and Owen and Abby, who are trying in vain to breathe new life into a five year relationship that is growing stale. It's an exploration of the grey areas of contemporary dating and how much we keep from the people we're closest to.","popularity":1.398,"poster_path":"/emeZGgODkO9jVQuDx4Oar5XbOQV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In a Relationship","video":false,"vote_average":8.2,"vote_count":5}
