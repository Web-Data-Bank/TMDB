The \"big guns\" are a misfit duo of ethically questionable characters who must infiltrate a gay nightclub and \"fit in\" while they search for clues. What ensues is both hilarious and action-packed.  Oboreru Sakana is a rather ambitious and often hilarious contemporary crime thriller. Its narrative swings from the grisly to the humorous and pulls in as many pop culture elements as it can manage.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xTlMacjKujS3hHCqPYfrcBfZOMh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2001-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Drowning Fish","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
