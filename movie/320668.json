One is an office worker who also works at 7-11 at night, who also has a pretty fiancee who is being hassled by loan sharks. The other is a gorgeous interior designer. The nightmares happen to them in reality, and start small. The man is attacked by a hand jumping out of a computer keyboard, while videotape attacks the girl. But the nightmare isn't all bad. Two weird brothers, who only appear in these people's dreams, force lots of money into their pockets, which they can use in the real world. But the payback for this money is quite high","popularity":0.604,"poster_path":"/6J5jRhlaRSAC5wyP5qPHRnkTnII.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1988-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Dream is Yours","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
