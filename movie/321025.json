Bright, capable of looking after himself, streetwise, he's the last person you'd expect to become a victim of bullying. But after he comes to the aid of a victimized school-friend, Daniel becomes the target of systematic, ruthless and destructive abuse. It starts as a personal battle between Daniel and his teenage aggressors - but it soon becomes clear that it's aided and abetted by the very people Daniel might rely upon to help - the teachers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1999-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Walking on the Moon","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
