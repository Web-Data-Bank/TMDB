The film alternates between Pindell recounting her stories and a caricature of a young white woman who rebukes Pindell for her ungrateful and paranoid statements. In criticizing the expectations and stereotypes imposed on a female, black artist, Pindell’s work can also been seen as a contribution to a feminist debate. Though Pindell’s body of work mostly consists of painting that explores texture, colour and structures, this video work stands out as being a seminal work in her career. Free, White and 21 can be found in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York.","popularity":0.654,"poster_path":"/jEFIGkmiL73WRFIeCjzkSbvc0wH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Free, White and 21","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
