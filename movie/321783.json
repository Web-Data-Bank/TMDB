He whiles away his days in a chair in the house of his son and daughter-in-law. He has to see how his adulterous daughter-in-law plots to murder her two foster children and her husband. Jean-Marie can't intervene and because he can't talk he can't warn his own family. Misfortune, tragic developments, and a fatal ending dominated many of the early Dutch fiction films.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/97CECMNC8RHG4AWvuZy9JWpSu8r.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85332,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film-Fabriek Anton NÃ¶ggerath","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1909-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Grip","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
