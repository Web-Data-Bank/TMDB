The film shows the effects of this cold winter on daily life in the Netherlands. We see, for example, the frozen Hofvijver in The Hague, ice on the beach of Scheveningen, and Volendam being threatened by drifting ice. The severe frost also makes the third Elfstedentocht possible. We see images of the tour and of its winner, Coen de Koning, who poses at ease for the camera during his passage through Hindeloopen. The film also contains a few scenic shots in Hindeloopen of sledge-riding ladies in traditional costume.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1917-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Holland in Ice","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
