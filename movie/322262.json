Subjectified lets women speak for themselves. While our culture is saturated with images of female sexuality, the real voices of women themselves are frequently missing. Through in-depth interviews, Subjectified lets women do the talking, trading easy answers and stereotypes for brutal honesty. The stories may sound familiar: young moms, abstinent Christians, lesbians, survivors of assaults and STDs. But outside the world of reality TV and sound bites, women approach their lives in complex and unexpected ways: sometimes hilarious, sometimes sobering, and always heartfelt. Subjectified will change the way you think about women's sexuality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Subjectified: Nine Young Women Talk about Sex","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
