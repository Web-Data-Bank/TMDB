'Chung-Wha-Roo' is the only Chinese restaurant in town until a new Chinese restaurant by the name 'A-Bang-Goong' opens right across the street. At first, A-Bang-Goong seems less than enthusiastic about their business; the exterior of the restaurant resembles a warehouse without a signboard, and all the employees are grotesque and brusque, even lacking the willpower for decent service including delivery. Despite the fact they serve only two dishes on the menu, their incredible gourmet flavor quickly becomes the toast of the town. As A-Bang-Goong becomes a local and nationwide phenomenon,, WANG, the owner of Chung-Wha-Roo becomes desperate. WANG visits his rival's to taste the famous dishes. However, he falls faint after discovering a human finger in his food.","popularity":1.894,"poster_path":"/8SzsRehDGQ6snVO4GhmYc9rLmLO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126109,"logo_path":null,"name":"HwangKiSung Films","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"1998-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Growing Business","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4}
