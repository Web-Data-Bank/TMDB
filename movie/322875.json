From the plains of in Mongolia to a hotel room in Beijing and back. A beautiful fiction debut by the maker of the award-winning The Land. Time and the impossibility of reconstructing the past form the themes that bring together the three stories in Erdos Rider - just as previously in Wang Haolin’s 2009 film The Land (at that time the director used the name He Jia). Truth is hidden among the interwoven stories, a voice tells us at the start of the film. Or maybe there is no truth in the world.  © iffr.com","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":45559,"logo_path":null,"name":"Beijing YuanQi Cultural Development Co.,LTD","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2014-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Erdos Rider","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
