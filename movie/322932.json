Life continues on in this vein until he meets a young model whom he invites up to his boss's temporarily vacant country house, pretending the house belongs to him. Not very far away, bulldozers and other machinery are clearing the beautifully wooded area so construction can start on an amusement park. Little does Bernabe realize that his potential new conquest is a seriously fanatical environmental advocate, and she arrives at the house with friends, gets Bernabe high and \"out of it,\" and then she and her friends proceed to trash the construction machinery. Once Bernabe comes around again, he finds out what has happened, loses heart for his planned sexual escapade, and begins to appreciate his wife for the first time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sDy7RYBHtmAYlZpP3Cu8Cg3Nxa8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":36428,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Salamandra","origin_country":""},{"id":2101,"logo_path":null,"name":"C.B.
