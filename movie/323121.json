After three days, an area the size of England becomes contaminated with radioactive dust, creating a 'zone' of poisoned land. Based on Mario Petrucci's award-winning book-length poem (split over two books), 'Heavy Water: a film for Chernobyl', and the shorter version 'Half Life: a Journey to Chernobyl\", tells the story of the people who dealt with the disaster at ground-level: the fire-fighters, soldiers, 'liquidators', and their families.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4EAAmTvVCq0ZYrq8cKKz3Xero7k.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-07","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heavy Water: A Film for Chernobyl","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
