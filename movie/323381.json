In this teen-oriented film, Christian (Christensen) is a young man in search of love, who restlessly leaves his home in Denmark to search for it all over Europe, finally finding some semblance of it in Morocco. This slight film is directed by Gabriel Axel, who also directed Babette's Feast. It is likeliest to be of interest to fans of the star and his music, which is used throughout.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bxi6IdhIK4HTdae91YUIgrl4OlP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15553,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chrysalide Film","origin_country":""},{"id":750,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ellepi Films","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":9371,"logo_path":null,"name":"Victoria Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1989-12-26","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Christian","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
