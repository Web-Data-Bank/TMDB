His mother is an invalid; the town hates him and a particularly nasty businessman has plans for him that will tear his life apart. One day, after losing a crucial fight, a stranger only known as 'The Collector' arrives to take him away and drop him in the middle of an unforgiving landscape, where he will either sink or swim. Toby realizes that he has died and landed in a cruel holding pattern between heaven and hell, where he must find his own way, or be forever stuck going in circles. Although the journey is at times brutal and cruel, it is an ultimately rewarding story of a lost soul finding its place in the universe.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-08-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Road","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
