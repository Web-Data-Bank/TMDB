Its unusual length, the adjunction of soloists and of choruses, the choice of the Ode to Joy by Schiller, all of this concurs to its fame. The Ninth Symphony is a \"Big Bang\" in symphonic terms. A grandiose apotheosis, sublimating all of Beethoven's work by being the most universal and immediately understood piece ever written.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7RVVYH2zQJn9uLgHdvGtGLaB2O4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79658,"logo_path":null,"name":"EuroArts Music International","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beethoven: Symphony No. 9 - Claudio Abbado, Berliner Philharmoniker","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
