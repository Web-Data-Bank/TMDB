The filmmakers created powerful short documentaries that showed America's strength not through images of tanks, but in portraits of farmers, school children and window washers. The \"Projections of America\" films were brilliant, moving portraits of America that were unlike any films ever made before, but seventy years later they are forgotten, hidden away in government archives. Narrated by John Lithgow, PROJECTIONS OF AMERICA tells the dramatic story of Riskin and his team, and the risks they took to project a profoundly democratic vision of the nation that would soon emerge as the most powerful on earth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/BFn4cRmv4jcAZVRsczqv7FpTAJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Projections of America","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
