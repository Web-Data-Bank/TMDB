When the Bishop, despite objections from many within his faith, decided to take his family’s musical ministry outside the church, he unexpectedly connected with the oddest of allies – a jaded, atheistic rock critic, who also happened to be a gospel historian. To Michael Corcoran, the Jones Family Singers represent a living link to a style of gospel he thought had disappeared. These most unlikely of friends bonded through perhaps their one shared trait -- a deeply rooted rebelliousness.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Jones Family Will Make a Way","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
