The film was shot from a small cabin boat moored near the mouth of the Keyhaven river. This is a place known to me since my childhood and the location for several paintings, films and photographic pieces. The camera was fixed relative to the motion of the boat as it responded to the action of wind and tide. This resulted in an intermittent scanning of 360 degrees about the central axis provided by the mooring, and a periodic vertical motion of about eight feet due to the rise and fall of the tide. A four second section of the film was exposed every fifteen minutes between dawn and dusk.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xQBHoFFeTSEsEsxOz71X8BRZmlW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Estuary","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
