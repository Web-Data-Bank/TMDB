The Chachapoya culture flourished between 800 and 1500 AD in northern Peru, at an altitude of more than 3,000 meters. No one knows for sure whether the Chachapoyas came out of the jungles or the mountains, but they settled in a place that seems impossibly difficult to live in: the mountainous fringes of the Peruvian jungle.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":46536,"logo_path":null,"name":"Explora Films","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Joya and the Warriors in the Mist","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
