His supremely creepy assistant Traumer, strikingly played by Majewski regular Andrzej Rausz, is one such creation. Professor H. intends to transpose Traumer’s brain with that of a renowned scientist, but is in for a surprise.  A dark film in every sense, DOCENT H. is particularly noteworthy for its soundtrack, consisting of eerie whirs and beeps interspaced with snatches of Bach’s immortal “Toccata and Fugue in D Minor.” (from: http://www.fright.com/edge/JanuszMajewski.htm)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jD3FOaGGd5zqQ9d14tZnqtVTEeG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6551,"logo_path":null,"name":"Se-Ma-For","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1968-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Associate Professor H.","video":false,"vote_average":9.25,"vote_count":2}
