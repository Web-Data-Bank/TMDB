A duel between the all-dominant immaculate digital and the irregular organic material dissolves in multiple layers of chaos. Enormous quantities of light movements from film loops capture the screen in thousands of pixels of digital projection and create new images in constant change and enhancement. The sound accompanying them live only repeats and spreads the noise, developing images by whirling speed. Noise, located on the tape as a constituent part of the film, becomes the aim of Makino’s quest – Noise-Image. This quest for a new film experience intensifies with additional effects – a smoke curtain reveals the fullness of the light beams’ rainbow spectrum, while a neutral single-eye ND filter creates a three-dimensional illusion.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9fxXyEKXsCYRBWah5k38llbHPRF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Space Noise","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
