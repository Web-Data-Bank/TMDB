Two close images were taken, with the subject -a heather plant- on a turning platform. The heather blossoms are tiny, on average less than 1/8 inch in size. Color was augmented and transformed via computer. Movement was computer-created by way of an editing-formula of my invention (patented) by which 3D films can be made from 2D imagery exploiting similarities and differences between two adjacent film-frames. Active 3D events appear that impossibly continue in one direction without change, my name for them is both silly and fitting: eternalisms.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"DAY AND NIGHT","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
