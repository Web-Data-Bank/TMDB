His style, moves, and sheer confidence were unprecedented. Nowadays, Tommy runs an Italian Deli to support his family. His hairline has receded and his fashion has faded. When Tommy discovers his fiancée, Stefi, had an affair, he is forced back into a world that has passed him by. His friends Stan and Nick reintroduce him to the NJ nightlife. He struggles to adapt to a younger world of $400 bottles of vodka, “iced out chains” and super-spiked hair. Tommy, sinking deeper into crisis, accepts the cautionary advice of a town degenerate and through newfound motivation meets an adorable Texan named Gina. The couple hits it off. Tommy lands his own reality-television show--“The Last American Guido”—and things are looking up. That is until Gina’s overly protective ex, Johnny, conspires with Stefi in a plot to use Tommy’s reality show against him and sabotage his relationship.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/qqhKMbITrLq59GSlCzXhQGP1w0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last American Guido","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
