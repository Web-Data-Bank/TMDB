The environmental, climate, public health, ethical, and human impacts are enormous and remain largely undocumented. WHAT'S FOR DINNER? explores this terrain in fast-globalizing China through the eyes of a retired pig farmer in rural Jiangxi province; a vegan restaurateur in Beijing; a bullish young livestock entrepreneur; and residents of the province known as the 'world's factory' contending with water polluted by wastes from pig factory farms. They personalize the vast trends around them, in a country on the cusp of becoming a world power. Given that every fifth person in the world is Chinese, what the Chinese eat and how China produces its food, affects not only China, but the world, too.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What's For Dinner?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
