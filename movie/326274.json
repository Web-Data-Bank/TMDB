With her physical limitations lifted, and the confirmation that her life matters, she blossoms into a confident young woman, using her newly found capabilities to bring hope back to her village. Gorgeously filmed in the Ethiopian countryside, Zemene is a poignant testament to the strength of the human spirit – and a powerful depiction of how much impact one person can have on another’s life. - Pia Chamberlain","popularity":1.344,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zemene","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
