Amudha (Nikitha), Krishnasamy's daughter, hates her father because she thinks that he is a killer.  A few years before, Krishnasamy was a tea master with his friend Kandhasamy (Goundamani). After his father's death, Krishnasamy had a lot of responsibility. He fell in love with Sindhamani (Roja). In the meantime, Samiyappan, a local don, canceled his engagement because Sindhamani's father promised Sindhamani to his son (Raja). One day, Krishnasamy ridiculed Samiyappan in a politic function. This humilition irks Samiyappan, so his henchmen burnt Krishnasamy's house and Krishnasamy's brother who was in the house died.
