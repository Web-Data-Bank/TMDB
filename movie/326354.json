The invention of the telephone and the phonograph at end of the nineteenth century marks a rupture in our experience of the human voice - a rupture which simultaneously fulfills a promise given by prophets and shamen since ancient times. Suddenly a voice can issue from out of nowhere, from the wrong mouth or from beyond the grave. Listening to our own voice, we experience ourselves as others.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Lecture on Schizophonia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
