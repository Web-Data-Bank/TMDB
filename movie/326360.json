A unique experiment shows us how complex the social strategies in the community of this fascinating anthropoid ape are. Haanstra managed to capture almost all aspects of chimpanzee behaviour: display of skill, teasing and pestering, grooming, resting, playing, motherly behaviour, submission, sex and violence. Eventually, the film was also screened to the apes.","popularity":0.984,"poster_path":"/zldnWG47TqfNJgRmFKjCz4db6mA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81625,"logo_path":"/44zYo2Zit3zJrcSGkO5jEFPULgD.png","name":"Nederlands Instituut voor Beeld en Geluid","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":46991,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bert Haanstra Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Family of Chimps","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":6}
