Security, much less peace, would seem to be unattainable; it is even difficult to find a common language in a country where everyone mistrusts each other. The directors of this film accompanied an ANA company during a year of frontline duty in Helmand. The soldiers are paid irregularly, there are not enough supplies and their equipment is substandard. They cannot fight a war with the equipment left behind by the ISAF.","popularity":0.925,"poster_path":"/30OI0TjyaWOZA1G0Lwh35lzSuYB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71779,"logo_path":null,"name":"NHK Cosmomedia","origin_country":""},{"id":15505,"logo_path":"/3MuBcEqLa5QRkZTpXBLzyk9zOmO.png","name":"NHK","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":69182,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ponda","origin_country":""},{"id":69183,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tourist With A Typewriter","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AF","name":"Afghanistan"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tell Spring Not to Come This Year","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":7}
