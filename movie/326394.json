But don't remember much. The greatest moments of our existence aren't retained. And neither are our worst. Authenticity means jack anymore. And that isn't right. How is this age going to be remembered in 200 years? 500? We live in an age of transitional technology. Everything is instantaneous. Cheap. Silly. It appears and it disappears just as fast. But this time we got the band together. And did it our way. This is our bookmark. Our full stop. It is an actual document of individuality and modern surfing and living and romping and laughing. Collect it and recollect on it. Here we are now, entertain us. And we'll take it from there. Enjoy your Coca-Cola tour. We're spiking your soda, then the glass and kicking in the door to the museum.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/duTiK3KNvCR7o5xM1VQ6CPaYmfx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cluster","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
