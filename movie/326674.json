While similar to other Tracy Anderson Method workouts, this post-pregnancy video focuses on regaining your abdominal strength and helping the skin on your stomach adhere to your muscles again. This is a restorative workout that I also recommend for older clients or people with injuries. This is a complete Tracy Anderson Method workout and is also great for beginners to the Method as they can also learn the basics and fundamentals. I recommend that you do this workout until you feel you have completely regained your strength and can begin your Metamorphosis workouts.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":16839,"logo_path":"/wxIDEXG8COFTlY96jbgrIEgKQb3.png","name":"Anchor Bay Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Tracy Anderson Method: Post-Pregnancy Workout","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
