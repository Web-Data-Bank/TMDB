Goema Goema Goema!  Weaving together the ancient, the traditional, and the classical into the contemporary universal sound of Cape Town, Mac MacKenzie, musical mastermind and founder of The Genuines and The Goema Captains of Cape Town, puts together the final touches to the culmination of his lifeâ€™s work: Goema in Five Movements. Musicians and musical commentators Hilton Schilder, Neo Muyanga, Iain Harris and Graham Arendse, and new kids on the block, Kyle Shepherd and Shane Cooper, add a contemporary context to Goema, while the orchestra rehearses for its premiere performance at the SABC studios.","popularity":0.614,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Afrikaans","iso_639_1":"af","name":"Afrikaans"},{"english_name":"Xhosa","iso_639_1":"xh","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mama Goema: The Cape Town Beat in Five Movements","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":2}
