After Andrew (Todd Michael Smith), a married writer, is kidnapped by Eddy (Steven Michael McKenzie), a seductive and surprisingly forthcoming serial killer, he is compelled to write about him and the two begin a strange sexual relationship. The actors hold absolutely nothing back from the camera. McKenzie and Smith offer full-frontal nudity and graphic scenes of unsimulated sex - with some sinister kink and a little bloodshed thrown in for good, horrific measure (the blood is fake, of course)!","popularity":1.216,"poster_path":"/5YZQ8eAYwk8CPBWwKZpWlKcBLn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":47163,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shane Miles","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Two serial killers in love, one wife betrayed.","title":"The Writers","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
