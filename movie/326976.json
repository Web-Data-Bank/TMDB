If you’re not familiar with the drummer, producer, composer, francofunkateer amongst countless other titles and roles, he’s kind of a god, on par with Giorgio Moroder, Nile Rodgers and the like. Pitchfork has gathered raw concert footage and interview with Rodgers, Bob Sinclar, Dave Haslam and the man himself (who chalks-up his fascination with electric music numbers to seeing Jimi Hendrix perform live in Paris as a teenager) to delve into the mans incalculable contribution to the DNAs of dance floor freakers and pop music alike (sampling years before it was adopted as hip-hop’s hammer and nail) and how he came to be so cherished by the greater funk cannon.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":42275,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pitchfork.tv","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cerrone","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
