He's also been called a God, a leader of the new semiotics, and a pioneer of the contemporary art movement. Ryan McGinness: Studio Process, unveils the creative process and highlights Ryan McGinness at work. To witness McGinness at work in his studio is meditative and hypnotic, a complete contrast from the multi-layered work he is well known for. From iconic silkscreen graphics to black light paintings, McGinness creates a hybrid of experiences that move beyond the traditional canvas platform. A modern inventor in many respects, Ryan McGinness uses technology and the traditional method of silk-screening to create meditative experiences that reconstitute the meaning of beauty and timelessness.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ryan Mcginness: Studio Process","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
