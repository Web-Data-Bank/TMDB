The youths range in age from 14 to 19. They hustle at the central train station and at clubs. Most of their clients are foreign tourists, many are German. The youths talk about why they hustle, their first trick, prices, dangers, what they know about AIDS, their fears (disease and loneliness), and how they imagine their futures. The film's title, its liturgical score, much of it elegiac, and shots of the city's statues of angels underline the vulnerability and callow lack of sophistication of the young men.","popularity":1.483,"poster_path":"/2E9d1Usule98ofykymjGx8MUW2x.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24948,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mirofilm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Not Angels But Angels","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":16}
