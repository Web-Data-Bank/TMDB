Based on seven years of ethnographic research by Douglas Sharon, the footage documents the activities of Eduardo Calderon, a Peruvian fisherman, ceramacist and  (healer).

Also explored is the importance of the local pre-Columbian ceramic art and iconography to Eduardo's healing practice; the use of herbs (including the San Pedro cactus), divination with the use of a live guinea pig, and the various ritual manipulations of the healer on his  (table).

The edited film EDUARDO THE HEALER was produced from this footage.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eduardo the Shaman: A Case Study of Culture and Hallucinogens","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
