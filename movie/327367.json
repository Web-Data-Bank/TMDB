A demonic force latches onto him and takes over his mind slowly, making the good part of him rot away. Almost like a possession by a demon. Only this demon called itself Jengo Hooper.  Expect some seriously mentally disturbing scenes, car chases, hot women, explosions, decapitated body parts and cannibalism.","popularity":1.071,"poster_path":"/gai9IcmcEDUSh57XGtyrIHuzcz3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":47336,"logo_path":null,"name":"Joe Wheeler Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jengo Hooper","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":5}
