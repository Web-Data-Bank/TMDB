The mysterious killer also catches a shady lawyer. Higgins and Lane find out that the key to the crimes is an unsolved diamond heist from jeweler Bolden. It looks like those involved are fighting over the loot. Eventually, it turns out that the \"robbery\" was actually a set-up insurance scam that Bolden was personally behind and that killed his employee. Shortly before the last survivor is sent to the afterlife, Higgins and Lane are able to confront the \"invisible\" murderer.","popularity":1.122,"poster_path":"/hmZOKLhveONzDbAQGxdqc8CFsAA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42272,"logo_path":"/2bAuO4EvS59O1uXZQAKXG0HIXQg.png","name":"RTL","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":29165,"logo_path":"/d1wokdgTjC7lJs6yktVd61JZrwD.png","name":"Rialto Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2002-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Edgar Wallace - Die unheimlichen Briefe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
