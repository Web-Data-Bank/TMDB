At the outbreak of the Second World War, many male Germans living in South-West Africa are interned in local camps. As pacifists the two German scientists refuse to be arrested and flee into the Namib Desert. They live for over two years in the vastness of the desert like ancient bushmen under indescribable circumstances, facing the challenge to survive and, at the same time, the threat to be detected. On the radio they follow the war events in Europe. Their adventure comes to an end when Hermann Korn starts suffering seriously from malnutrition.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/h45f5yEfVRkaJ5EysqF0dyrsupj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"},{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1991-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sheltering Desert","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
