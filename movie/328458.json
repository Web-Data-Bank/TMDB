My intelligence is in my body says Akram himself, a body built by acute observations of the reality, legends, and unceasing work here well represented by Gnosis, a pi√®ce realized in collaboration with seven artists expressely discovered in different parts of the world. These traditions and experimentations from India, Japan, Pakistan, England, Egypt, Iraq and Bangladesh collaborate together to create a work between classic indian kathak and contemporary dance. The film portrays the story of this peculiar human and artistic adventure often transcending the narration for the sake of a more visionary look influenced by the location where the documentary has been shot: the futuristic and conflictive city of Abu Dhabi with its desertic and metaphysical surroundings.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6hxMRBy9crBtNsVwZ3lpV4s4ZNw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":177616,"logo_path":null,"name":"Abu Dhabi Culture \u0026 Heritage","origin_country":""},{"id":626,"logo_path":null,"name":"Independent Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AE","name":"United Arab Emirates"}],"release_date":"2011-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Akram Tree","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
