Luc Novovitch, the filmmaker, was granted complete access to film their daily lives and duties, resulting in a film presenting a human and unvarnished vision of the lives and struggles of these women who fight to be accepted as priests by the Vatican. Through their movement, they promote their vision and goal of establishing a renewed and an all-inclusive Roman Catholic Church.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"God's Daughters","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
