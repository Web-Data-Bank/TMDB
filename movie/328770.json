He served his country as an ace fighter pilot in Korea and was the last man to ever hit over .400 for a season. This story isn’t about how he lived, but about the mystery surrounding his world after his death. Williams’s head (yes, his head) is preserved in cryostasis in a facility in Arizona. How this came to be remains a mystery shrouded in claims that his children mistreated him and wrapped in a notorious dirty cocktail napkin.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5N986xlUMoikt0R20UHZ2e0tlQG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18595,"logo_path":"/2K8ko5VX6K2JTLmyctDpvH7Sgk9.png","name":"ESPN Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Immortal Man","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
