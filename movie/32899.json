Caught in the middle is a scholarship student, Percy, at the more cerebral academy of the two. He had been dating Diana, but haughty silver-spoon student Geoffrey at the elite school of the well-off derailed them. So Diana came up with this plan as a way to make the immature boys both pay penance for their classless behavior and to have them actually earn their dates instead of merely expecting them. Which school will win the war? What if the faculties find out? How crazy will things get as the competition heats up?","popularity":1.409,"poster_path":"/pgZMhjS2tgh7bzjInWyYeVlrMjB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5232,"logo_path":null,"name":"Philms Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2008-05-09","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Prom Wars: Love Is a Battlefield","video":false,"vote_average":3.6,"vote_count":6}
