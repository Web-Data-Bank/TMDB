This film explores the double standard placed on female athletes to be the best players on the field and the sexiest off of it. Through stories of the women who have faced and tackled this question including Mary Lou Retton, Chris Evert, Lolo Jones, and Gabby Reece, \"Branded\" explores the question: can women's sports ever gain an equal footing with their male counterparts or will sex appeal always override achievement?","popularity":1.031,"poster_path":"/f7DtHopj8FCn3eI74DykQYxhb0e.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18595,"logo_path":"/2K8ko5VX6K2JTLmyctDpvH7Sgk9.png","name":"ESPN Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-08-27","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Branded","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
