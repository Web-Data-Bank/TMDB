Yannick Bellon’s captivating postmodernist film, as much a study of evanescence as any poem by Dickinson, segues into the film that Colette, a few years before her end, has just said she doesn’t want to do. Giving voice(over) to her own commentary, she goes back, first, to the home in Saint-Sauveur-en-Puisaye, Yonne, where she was born.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3tJsK5BVYqqd6ldZpMUqqivdxGT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1951-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Colette","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
