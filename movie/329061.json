Unfortunately, the things that are neglected are often lost forever, irreplaceable. This is the story of a man with a misguided and intense focus – one which started in his youth and carried on to old age. His life events are chronicled through the loss of his teeth – and how his obsessive efforts to amend what was damaged bring on yet further destruction.","popularity":0.863,"poster_path":"/qKQy5h3CPEh74PApFDdh4AZZXRK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":47953,"logo_path":null,"name":"Holbrooks","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"2015-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"That which is neglected, is lost.","title":"Teeth","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":22}
