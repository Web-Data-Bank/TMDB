They play beautiful duets on their violin and accordion, only to be interrupted by Josephine's brutish exterminator husband, Moe. And so Roach devises a plan: he crawls into Moe's brain and gains control of his higher functions. Manipulating Moe like a three hundred pound sock puppet, Roach woos Josephine.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-05-20","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Josephine and the Roach","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":3}
