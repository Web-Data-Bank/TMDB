Chai Jing started making the documentary when her as yet unborn daughter developed a tumour in the womb, which had to be removed very soon after her birth. Chai blames air pollution for the tumour. The film, which combines footage of a lecture with interviews and factory visits, has been compared with Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth in both its style and likely impact. The film openly criticises state-owned energy companies, steel producers and coal factories, as well as showing the inability of the Ministry of Environmental Protection to act against the big polluters.","popularity":2.6,"poster_path":"/hVEVL7y6ia4MaH2Q9d7MpgLVR78.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":176429,"logo_path":null,"name":"自费","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2015-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Under the Dome","video":false,"vote_average":7.778,"vote_count":18}
