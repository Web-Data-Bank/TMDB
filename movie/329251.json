Green himself travels to various reaches of the Earth to collect original footage of record-holding people, places, and things-the tallest man, the woman with the longest name, the oldest living thing on the planet. He weaves into these original portraits a rich assembly of archival footage, his own live narration, and an evocative live soundtrack from the chamber group yMusic to create an indelible rumination on fate, human endeavor, and the nature of our existence on Earth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9qvbNDDzF6QEG5yth7fsKEDemuy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Measure of All Things","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
