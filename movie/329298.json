They included frequent jazz-rock collaborator Ernie Watt, and David Benoit, master of a \"jazz-lite\" style. But guitarist Lee Ritenour is key man here: he calls most of the shots, and six of the eight pieces are his, including a fine tribute to early inspiration Wes Montgomery on \"24th Street Blues.\" For the most part, easy-going and mellow are the watchwords on this program - not surprising since the players tend to be based in Los Angeles. Ritenour's \"Etude\" stands out for its creation of atmosphere, and so do Dave Valentin's solo melodic meanderings on a selection of wooden flutes backed by his own vocal effects. All elements considered the bill is a demonstration of top-drawer musicianship, awareness of contemporary styles â€“ and versatility.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rNBpE1capru0iNGO4YnuraOYkBO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Music","title":"Lee Ritenour with special guests - Live in Montreal","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
