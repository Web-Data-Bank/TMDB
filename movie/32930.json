Among the topics Bill discusses in his ninth HBO solo special are: Whether the \"Great Recession\" is really over; the fake patriotism of the right wing; what goes on in the mind of a terrorist; why Obama needs a posse instead of the secret service; the drug war; Michael Jackson; getting out of Iraq and Afghanistan; racism; the Teabagger movement; religion; the health-care fight; why Gov. Mark Sanford will come out looking good, and how silly it is to ask \"Why do men cheat?\"; and why comedy most definitely didn't die when George Bush left office.","popularity":2.71,"poster_path":"/aZuGEdTcYg5hsc7jMar98vwjvGc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21203,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bill Maher Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":12088,"logo_path":null,"name":"Moffitt-Lee Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bill Maher: But I'm Not Wrong","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":24}
