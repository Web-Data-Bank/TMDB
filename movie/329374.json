They are arranging for the gradual smuggling of components into Iran to build a small nuclear weapon, for which they use eleven mules, each carrying a different part. The plan is that one week before the International Atomic Energy Agency is to inspect Iran’s nuclear facilities, they will detonate the bomb near a famous sports stadium in Tehran in order to cause mayhem and mass destruction and discredit the Iranian government. Written and directed by Behrouz Afkhami, from a story that is loosely based on the novel The Fourth Protocol by Frederick Forsyth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nHjI3rRtK6iKeJWsyrHDJxpf4xC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48046,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mahab Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Day of the Devil","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
