In O VAMPIRO DA CINEMATECA Ferreira develops a poetic representation of his idea of “inventive cinema” without a plot in the classical sense. Ferreira mixes situations of everyday life in the streets of São Paulo with scenes from classics of film history, which he filmed from television or from a projection with his Super 8 camera. The author as a vampire sucks from various sources – not only in cinema, but also in poetry and music – and creates a portrait of his time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aO1sUuSIxT1BNoTEsUcTEUXzkiz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110980,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jairo Ferreira Produções Cinematográficas","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Vampire of the Cinematheque","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
