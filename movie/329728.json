As a period piece La Nuit du Phoque is unbeatable, and it alone would make an impressive bonus.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/14Mt4LUyrmyZjIxDubXmwjidwSa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Night of the Seal","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
