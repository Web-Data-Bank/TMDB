Dalton Law (John Kasper), the beloved local weatherman, never missed a day of work or misguided his towns people to imperfect forecasts. Daltons days are predictable, down to his morning coffee and daily bathroom run-ins with anchorman Dan Anders (Mike Gavern). However, this particular day in Cyphers County is not so predictable. Dalton predicts an acid rain storm this evening but does not predict his unfortunate meeting of Holley Cooper (Dominique Capone), the new intern at Action 13 News. Holley, unbeknownst to the news station crew, is a recovering psychopath on her way to becoming a lead weatherman, or should we say \"weatherwoman\".","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/f3jY3SgMibPWeJwlhFp4xQkfvwR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deatherman","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
