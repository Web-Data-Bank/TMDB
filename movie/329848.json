Hilarity and Culture ensue in \"Wayfaring - A Jaunt along the Camino de Santiago\". You'll meet...Monique, a New York sophisticate trying to lose her cynicism...Thrice-timer Eddie from Ireland who constantly waxes philosophic about the Camino....Brandon from Texas who finds himself skeptical of those who divulge their alleged reasons for walking The Way.
