In her fall, a bone from her ankle breaks: the astragal. She is rescued by Julien, a justice fugitive, and so is born a burning passion between them. He takes her to Paris and hides her. But while he leads his gangster life here and there, the young woman struggles for her freedom and against the wounds inflicted by Julien’s absence, and writes poetry.","popularity":2.329,"poster_path":"/agivxVoWqDNmOo8pg2gTQhKPkzn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3061,"logo_path":"/gseYJDkfTwGKG6qHbAa4SY9w1UV.png","name":"Alfama Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2015-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Astragal","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":26}
