Punctuated by the exotic and suggestive tribal dances and rituals performed on stage by 15 of Fela's wives, this exceptional event was captured by multiple cameras, enhancing this special DVD presentation.  Fela was a musician, a politician, a spiritual chief, and an agitator all at once, but however one views the man, he was undeniably a symbolic icon of struggle &amp; revolution, as well as one of the most beloved men in Africa. In Nigeria, Fela claimed that he was better known than the President. It was probably true.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/i0l9ecz6BhlpLXUOAbe2w2DViqV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fela In Concert","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
