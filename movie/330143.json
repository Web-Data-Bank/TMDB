On her son and on herself. After all, she raised Ben all by himself, and today the 18-year-old is an all-round successful boy. Ben knows about his conception only as much as that he is a child of pure love. He never knew his father, so he does not miss him either. Sylvia is his mother and closest confidant at the same time. But this trust threatens to break as Sylvia is caught up in her past and Ben has to learn that he is actually the product of a rape. Everything seems to be in question in one fell swoop.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/706kmqe5YPmU06zXpyPC90S8HGd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2015-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Am Ende des Sommers","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2}
