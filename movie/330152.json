Throughout the Middle Ages, the Papal Inquisition forbade biblical translation, threatening imprisonment and death to those who disobeyed.  Learn the stories of valiant warriors of the faith, such as John Wycliffe, William Tyndale, Martin Luther, the ancient Waldenses, Albigenses and others who hazarded their lives for the sake of sharing the Gospel light with a world drowning in darkness.  Once the common people were able to read the Bible, the world was turned upside down through the Protestant Reformation.","popularity":0.961,"poster_path":"/7MnByQpQjlUJ2qIvFxPzgmllx9x.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48421,"logo_path":null,"name":"Adullam Films LLC","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":178,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Enter into a world of saints and martyrs battling against spies, assassins and wolves in sheep’s clothing.","title":"A Lamp In The Dark: The Untold History of the Bible","video":false,"vote_average":3.2,"vote_count":2}
