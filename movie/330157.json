A wealthy merchant who hired the caravan is against taking The Woman along, but the commander of the soldiers, Verrus, overrules him. Verrus tries to get friendly with her, promising all kinds of wealth for her favors. The caravan encounters a group of Jdean refugees fleeing from King Herod's orders to kill all male children. They are on their way to Egypt with a male child with them.

Then the sand hits the fan.","popularity":1.091,"poster_path":"/wc3vUqhMFJbyKhnCvwl6YdwyIHw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84720,"logo_path":null,"name":"Venturini-Express-Nasht","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1959-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Desert Temptress Against The Roman Sword!","title":"Desert Desperadoes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
