Identical and opposites, face to face or, more often, back to back, in a small room in a timeless space. Twins and adversaries, these two girls make one: Lunettes uses her glasses to help her understand the world, or at least accept it; Myope can't see, except within herself, and lost in her blurred, but sharp, experience of the world, rebels continuously. Incited by Lunettes, Myope creates (in the same city and climate, but in another dimension) two characters: Pierrot and Agathe. To a certain degree, these two are a disjointed response to Myope, Lunettes, neighbors, and distant representatives. It's very hot. The inhabitants are interested in fountains and shadows. They build cool cabins, hanging curtains over the balcony balustrades. Asphalt sticks to the soles of sandals and when the wind blows, the canopies flap above the caf√© terraces.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/9jFbohH1PZUKL0aR7S1jBH90LOi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paris, My Little Body Is Very Tired of This Big World","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3}
