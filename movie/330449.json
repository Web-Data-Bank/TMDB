In a decrepit house that once belonged to a bourgeois family, several families seek shelter. Senis, a 65-year-old alcoholic, lives on the ground floor with his wife and their 16-year-old daughter. Senis is a survivor of the Nazis as well as the communist camps. He drowns the pain of his memories in a nearby pub and in talking to a depressed young laborer, Lorenca. Later on, a young couple and a lonely eccentric who enjoys only his cat's company join the inhabitants. Children wile away the time with useless games or spying on adults. When Lorenca hangs himself at the ruins of a nearby factory, the lives are shaken up. During the dinner held for the deceased, they find a moment of common hope.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/56t0aKqffifN54k6H2GjBXSooJZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48496,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Uljana Kim","origin_country":"LT"},{"id":2256,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films de L'Observatoire","origin_country":""},{"id":94,"logo_path":"/huC7HqorvUThGIrENrbcHmQVUA0.png","name":"ARTE France Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2000-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Courtyard","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
