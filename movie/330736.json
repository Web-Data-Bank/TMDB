We observe her as she speaks and then hears her words relayed back to her through a delayed transmission. Remarkably eloquent for one caught in such a feedback loop, Holt provides a monologue on experiencing time, thought, and oneself through technology. She remarks, “I have a double take on myself. I am once removed from myself … we are hearing and seeing a world of double reflections and double refractions.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/s7qhDkuy5INAKjX6Xdgl2DCylFR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boomerang","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
