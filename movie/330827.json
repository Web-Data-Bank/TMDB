The civil war, which began in 1975, has been over for two years. Randa Chahal Sabbag, a Lebanese film-maker whose family was politically and military involved in the conflict, gives a very personal view of these seventeen years of war. She uses archives, family videos and 16 mm films made between 1975 and 1994. The film features interviews with her mother in Tripoli, her sister in Paris and her brother in Beirut. She pays tribute to the memory of her father, who died during the war, and returns to the ruins of a city, the reconstruction of which marks the disappearance of a part of her life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/199aB2cQbgq8TbZuaSExKFrbKvz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Our Heedless Wars","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
