This work allows us to see a love on the verge of drifting. Each of the scenes pummels emotional nodes, which are made and unmade by daily abrasions, observing the crossed polarities from which relentless loves are composed. In this elastic space-time, suspended outside the real, two inner worlds start to collide.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Y2o{Distillé}","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
