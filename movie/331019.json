Fort Chipewyan, Alberta, is well known as a community that is fighting against the pollution from resource extraction which they claim is causing cancers and degrading their traditional territories. Despite the many documentaries that have been produced about the Oil Sands, Fort Chip has been just a small voice amidst the cries of celebrities, scientists and politicians. Our documentary is a collaborative, community effort of 33 interviews with local Cree, Dene and Metis members from Fort Chipewyan. It gets to the heart of their concerns for their families, traditional ways and territories as the Oil Sands encroach closer and closer.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One River Many Relations","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
