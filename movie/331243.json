I rehearsed a certain amount of continuous time each day, logging almost 70 hours of uninterrupted improvisation. I recorded a number of these sessions, and layered them into two tracks.\r In addition to playing guitar, I also hiked into waterfalls, went swimming all the time, watched sunsets from the tops of mountains, helped process thousands of spawning salmon, etc. I took my camcorder with me most of those places. I've compiled some of the things my camcorder saw into this video, a format I'm tentatively calling a collaged home movie. It's in two parts - Side A, and Side B. Each is about a half an hour long.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Double Alaska","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
