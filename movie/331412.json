All visitors to his studio, the Factory. Subjects were captured in stark relief by a strong keylight, and filmed by Warhol with his stationary 16mm Bolex camera on silent, black and white, 100-foot rolls of film. The resulting two-and-a-half-minute film reels were then screened in slow motion, resulting in a fascinating collection of four-minute masterpieces that startle and entrance, mesmerizing in the purest sense of the word. Songwriters Dean Wareham and Britta Phillips, formerly of the band Luna and currently recording as Dean & Britta, incorporated original compositions as well as cover songs to create new soundtracks for the 13 films.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/y0L8CGgz8YOcBM0zhV5wN0IyKBG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"This is the first ever authorised release of films by Andy Warhol","title":"13 Most Beautiful… Songs for Andy Warhol's Screen Tests","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
