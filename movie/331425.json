Keeping watch by his bedside, his wife is at a loss as he begins to tell of a long feverish dream set in a legendary (and supernatural) time and place where an unfaithful wife suffers a terrible fate. Ali then attributes his ailment to his wife and accuses her of being unfaithful to him. In order to prove her loyalty to him, the wife blinds herself with sharp object, which miraculously results in Ali’s instant recovery. However, he now abandons his sightless wife and commits adultery with a singer-artiste Dayang. As the plan proceeds, Ali’s wife and her close friend become collateral victims and are killed in a car wreck. Their spirits return to haunt the evildoers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/g5gKXzF3Mnk7g9oxncHnzhNvFLu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29618,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cathay-Keris Film Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MY","name":"Malaysia"}],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malay","iso_639_1":"ms","name":"Bahasa melayu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Keranda Berdarah","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
