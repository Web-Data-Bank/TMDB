The end of the world seems like a nightmare to Ben. A memory of a past life that doesn’t belong to him. When Ben starts to remember Isabelle, the only love he’s ever known, he realises she’s missing in his life. An existential descent into confusion and the desperate need to find out the truth begins. This reality depicts a stunning, surprising and dark world. A world that is clearly not his.","popularity":1.323,"poster_path":"/8a7freUGma1To2i8ZZ9xQBA1WJz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":35731,"logo_path":null,"name":"PostPanic","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2015-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sundays","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":21}
