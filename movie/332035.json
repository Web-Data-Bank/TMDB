In the first miniature, Schmitt films graves from the American Indian Wars as silent witnesses of a past that have left their traces on the collective American consciousness. Subsequently, we see blackandwhite street scenes in Hollywood, which are followed by almost familiar images â€“ a garden bench, a bouquet of flowers. Thus history, the public and the private form a new, abstract and yet tangible unity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":49185,"logo_path":null,"name":"LEE ANNE SCHMITT","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Three Stories","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
