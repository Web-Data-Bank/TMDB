Rejecting didacticism as a means of ethnographical observation, the film consists of distinct episodes that value the quality of the genuine moment. Spray couples both meaningful and disconcerting human interactions with the sights and sounds of natural familiarities such as grass, smoke, insects, animals, and traditional Nepalese folk music, opening up an evocative new world that the viewer is invited to slowly and deliberately experience.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NP","name":"Nepal"}],"release_date":"2007-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Nepali","iso_639_1":"ne","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kale and Kale","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
