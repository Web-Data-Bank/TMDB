Accompanied partly by a down-pitched version of Pink Floyd’s 1971 concert played “to the dead” at Pompeii, the work has an unsettling, morose quality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/x4iVbXU25b0bULxJpbRaFhkTa6B.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":49234,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rachel Rose","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Minute Ago","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
