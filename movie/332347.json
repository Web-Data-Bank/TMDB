She is flabbergasted by the violence, the cruelty and the killings that Mafia men project – even youngsters are not spared. But instead of targeting the men, Vittoria tries a new approach; an appeal to the women involved in these circles. The bosses’ wives are as hard as nails; they will not talk and will not betray their powerful husbands, but could it be they have a soft spot for their own children?","popularity":0.869,"poster_path":"/m5ai1zjQz6umw3H95VhKcxwv7PX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107598,"logo_path":"/eit3zBgVW90bGkgWYvVHvBwH5uW.png","name":"Dm Communication","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2015-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Land of Saints","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":5}
