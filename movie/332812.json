They take great pleasure in their one vacation a year together without their partners and meet-up regularly to spend evenings drinking or playing cards. Each has a successful career and they all appear to have perfect lives until the night Simon announces to his friends that he has just strangled his wife, Estelle after a blazing row. Max and Paul are horrified by Simon's confession, but worse is to come when Simon asks them to lie and provide him with an alibi for the time Estelle was killed. Both men are torn between lying or turning over their best friend to the police.","popularity":3.999,"poster_path":"/kIS2xmCZgEL0pWlhuv1cyZllVkw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1992,"logo_path":"/tGYQyvkKTqAEXidVisQ5FDipKAP.png","name":"La Petite Reine","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2015-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Our Women","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":90}
