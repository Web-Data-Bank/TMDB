Filmed over a ten year period, this documentary includes live footage of Masada, Naked City, Cobra, as well as improvisations, his classical work and rare interviews. A prize winner at European festivals, this film documents Heuermann's very personal, fifteen year odyssey with the music of John Zorn. At times frightening, at times hilarious, at times frighteningly hilarious.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eUrk8SAjjf0OSywP8tEgycMmLK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20099,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tzadik","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Bookshelf on Top of the Sky: 12 Stories About John Zorn","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4}
