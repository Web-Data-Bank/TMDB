But then, Werner has to learn to take on responsibility. When he was 18, he and his former girlfriend Tine, had a daughter called Julia, who is a mother herself now. Whenever she is in desperate need of a babysitter, she approaches Werner, who then grudgingly accepts. But Werner has discovered that this new \"job\" is a real godsend, as when he takes his granddaughter to the playground, he is a great hit with the ladies. He especially likes Kathie, who comes there with her little son Finn. Of course, he can't let her know that he is a granddad and so he says that he is Zora's fatherâ€¦ and to Julia's surprise - but also joy - he wants to babysit Zora as often as possible.","popularity":1.275,"poster_path":"/smWDNT9co0ZH9Mm7XTkwpdeWAZG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2015-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don't Call Me Grandpa","video":false,"vote_average":4.167,"vote_count":3}
