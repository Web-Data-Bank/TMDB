Eastovers refusal to sign a contract (when the miners joined with the United Mine Workers of America) led to the strike, which lasted more than a year and included violent battles between gun-toting company thugs/scabs and the picketing miners and their supportive women-folk. Director Barbara Kopple puts the strike into perspective by giving us some background on the historical plight of the miners and some history of the UMWA.","popularity":4.192,"poster_path":"/ellKxaweJC09DShpyvMESZZW9cO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7942,"logo_path":"/jcPtOtTkjEhvdJE6libr8ReqUch.png","name":"Cabin Creek Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1977-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Which Side Are You On?","title":"Harlan County U.S.A.","video":false,"vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":83}
