With a nagging wife who berates him for not being assertive enough, and a measly paycheck, he quietly suffers while awaiting a long-deserved promotion. But there's more to Aram than his mild-mannered demeanor lets on: he has been secretly devising a scheme to finally get what he feels he is owed. One day he asserts his power menacingly when he kidnaps a schoolgirl and keeps her tied up in an abandoned warehouse. What seems like the perfect plan soon unravels into his worst nightmare, and his carefully constructed scheme comes crashing down piece by bloody piece.","popularity":1.555,"poster_path":"/arw5A93JtCkeQ6yUzxx9O2vBTCG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23838,"logo_path":null,"name":"Salto de Fe Films","origin_country":""},{"id":22865,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mórbido Films","origin_country":"MX"},{"id":125276,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mr. Blue","origin_country":""},{"id":125277,"logo_path":null,"name":"rABYa Producciones","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Evil Games","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":26}
