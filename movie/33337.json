He's now a professor of Greek; she's loathe to tell him she's a police inspector. A call interrupts their first dinner date: a Deputy of the National Assembly has been murdered. She has a suspect, another Deputy, and must track him while deflecting Antoine's eye from her vocation. All roads in the inquiry lead to Christine Vallier, the dead Deputy's mistress, a beguiling 22-year-old whose mother ran the Assembly's snack bar. When more deputies die and Antoine learns Lise's identity, she must act quickly solve the crime and save her future.","popularity":3.15,"poster_path":"/rzHKScCssgA4gJZqNDxcYM4UgrU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7110,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Ariane","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":1772,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mondex Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1977-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dear Inspector","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":54}
