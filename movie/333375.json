After losing his own brother to the growing epidemic of prescription drug abuse, documentarian Chris Bell sets out to demystify this insidious addiction. Bell’s examination into the motives of big pharma and doctors in this ever-growing market leads him to meet with experts on the nature of addiction, survivors with first-hand accounts of their struggle, and whistleblowers who testify to the dollar-driven aims of pharmaceutical corporations. Ultimately his investigation will point back to where it all began: his own front door.","popularity":3.619,"poster_path":"/7V6sDOLCNXcqHsqToGDACbK3HGE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9118,"logo_path":"/9o6KLcDBRw3fNItUflJVwj8dZpC.png","name":"Samuel Goldwyn Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":13150,"logo_path":"/v9s0IXHruAX6APhu08b8FItrIf1.png","name":"Naked Edge Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Is there really a war on drugs?","title":"Prescription Thugs","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":40}
