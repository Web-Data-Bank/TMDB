If it sounds too good to be true, that’s because it was. Finch was an elaborate hoax constructed by the late George Plimpton for SI’s April 1 issue. Unhittable brings back all of the people who made this hoax possible, including Joe Berton, the bespectacled middle school teacher who truly brought Sidd to life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/khlqiNB2SozLtesvmxbFA76Ks5J.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18595,"logo_path":"/2K8ko5VX6K2JTLmyctDpvH7Sgk9.png","name":"ESPN Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unhittable: Sidd Finch and the Tibetan Fastball","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
