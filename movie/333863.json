First broadcast in 1971.  The ballet was first performed by the Danish Royal Ballet, first as a TV show on the Danish public service channel called DR in 1971, then as a performance at the Danish Royal Theatre in 1972. The main part was danced by Vivi Flindt, and Flemming Flindt also starred. The ballet caused quite a stir, partly because of its spectacular nude dancing, but also the catchy music, published both complete on vinyl (which double-lp) and in abbreviated form on vinyl and CD.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"1973-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Ballet","title":"Dødens Triumf","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
