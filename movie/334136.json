War and Love are simply equated for what they are; the aftermath is inevitable, and a normal human condition, for which like the ancients one can only have pity and understanding. In this lies the mystery. All else is irrelevant. That there are other sub-currents of equal power in The Mysteries goes without saying; and, those who are capable of the numerous visual visitations and annunciations which the film offers them will realize what is the Ultimate Mystery of my work.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2PLZX2HVANTqESDM9zAqLMYeVss.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1968-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mysteries","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
