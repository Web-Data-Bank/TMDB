In these shows, Simon never appears on stage. Instead he sits in the audience behind a box of tricks that can display his face, the table or both. From here he contrives to make live films - or Fylms - which are projected on a big screen at the front of the theatre. What you see on the DVD is exactly what the audiences saw on their big screen.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Simon Munnery: Fylm Makker","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
