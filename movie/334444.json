The wife, whose pride is injured by being cast off for a courtesan, follows her husband and sees him join his sweetheart at their rendezvous. The pair stroll down the river, where they enter a small boat, and, unconscious that they are being watched by the cast-off wife from the shore, they float along while the gallant lover strums on his guitar and sings songs of love to the queen of his heart. The jealous wife keeps a close watch on them until they land on a square, where they join in the revelry with other happy young lovers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1908-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sang espagnol","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
