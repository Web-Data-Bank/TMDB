These were his last four years. Dapitan served as his prison cell. He always compared it to “a beautiful cage” where he is imprisoned. This was the longest imprisonment Rizal ever had. He became so lost by those times, but still he did not lose his mind. Even there, he continued studying and discovering things. He continued his conversation with his friends, scientists and doctors outside the country.","popularity":1.558,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":9130,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mov-Pix International Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":60051,"logo_path":null,"name":"Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company (PLDT)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"1997-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rizal in Dapitan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
