Confronting this desire leads to consequences, occurring during the act of portrayal. The desire to gaze transforms rapidly into the necessity to create, an inevitable reaction. The relationship towards the person whom is portrayed evolves. From an initial intimacy and proximity, grows the immanence of distance. The images are accompanied by a spoken text excerpt from Demian. Die Geschichte Einer Jugend (1919) by Hermann Hesse, which reflects upon and guides the face.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Demian’s Face","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
