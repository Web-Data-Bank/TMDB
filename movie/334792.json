Los Angeles is suffering from all the worst side effects of America's social and economic reforms. Industry, commerce and the middle classes have all jumped ship and left a husk of a city. The most basic public services such as roads and water run along the lines of money and in the poorer parts of town life breaks down. There is insecurity everywhere; privatisation threatens more jobs, social security is a misnomer and the land can be bought from under your feet. Immigration from South America and the far-east increases while middle class populations dwindle. A small clique presides over the image of the city, but it is a city that they hardly know. Without money or political power, the majority of people who live here are invisible.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Social Visions","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
