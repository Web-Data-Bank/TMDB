Unusually, after his second book of Madrigals was published in 1609 it appears he did not compose again despite being kept on at the house by Lady Kytson until her death in 1628. Draw On Sweet Night examines this mystery in a sumptuous costume drama, produced in collaboration with renowned vocal group I Fagiolini.","popularity":0.807,"poster_path":"/3nYEhFCTYRqWtzx7uBkROZFsWTU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18231,"logo_path":null,"name":"Capriol Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Draw on Sweet Night","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
