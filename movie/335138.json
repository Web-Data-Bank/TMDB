When the Vatican reprimands the sisters – citing their “radical feminism” – they become the spiritual and symbolic center of a battle for the heart of the Catholic Church. From their cross-country Nuns on the Bus tour, to serving those on the margins, to a continued struggle for women’s religious equality under Pope Francis, these sisters are transforming American politics — and the Church itself.","popularity":0.845,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":50904,"logo_path":null,"name":"Interchange Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Love is Blind.
