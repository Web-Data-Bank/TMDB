Known as one of the most dangerous places on Earth, the Sundarbans is the domain of what may be the largest, wildest remaining tiger population. Only 3,000 tigers remain in the wild throughout Asia, and as Alan journeys through the remote landscape of the Sundarbans, he confronts the treacherous terrain both tiger and man must navigate in their mutual struggle to survive. This may be his last journey; diagnosed with leukemia, Alan must face his own mortality as he races to save one of the world's most charismatic animals from the razor's edge of extinction.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oiLo2eJTBTZ492KWtrYxQTRMj0M.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1879,"logo_path":null,"name":"White Mountain Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tiger Tiger","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
