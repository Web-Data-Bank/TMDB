He seeks inspiration in various out of the way places. During this film viewers go with him to the Colisseum at night, on a subway ride past Roman ruins, to the Appian Way, to a slaughterhouse, and on a visit to Marcello Mastroianni's house. Fellini also is seen in his own office interviewing a series of unusual characters seeking work or his help.","popularity":1.484,"poster_path":"/ptAWCqXRNEsSRhiHLG3BRVcOejl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1502,"logo_path":"/ywjcvHUiKxv7cYsestkONF8LieH.png","name":"NBC","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1969-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fellini: A Directorâ€™s Notebook","video":false,"vote_average":6.75,"vote_count":18}
