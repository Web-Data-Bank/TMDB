He places the capital within the boundaries, but still, something is amissâ€¦ In the second work, he plants a place-name sign in a city. These two works are part of Gijzen's quest for the relationship between public space and names. Are names decisive for spaces? Do they define a space? And if so, what happens if you exchange one name for another? With these works, Gijzen also undermines the claim to truthfulness of the TV/video image.
