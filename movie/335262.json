Instead of starring a mysterious woman, the film stars a mysterious gray cat. The film is an unconventional narrative built around an afternoon catnap and blurs the lines between reality and dreams. With a hint of horror and a tone of suspense, this film pays homage to an avant-garde masterpiece of film history and offers a whimsical take on the feline enigma. Meows of the Afternoon is an inherently humorous re-imagining of an art film classic.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meows of the Afternoon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
