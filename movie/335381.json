Often out of focus with an overactive camera, the film immediately exudes nervous energy, but unlike Priest’s elegant cocaine consumption in Super Fly, Willie’s arm gushes blood as he injects heroin. A morality tale in two reels.  —Jan-Christopher Horak","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10250,"logo_path":null,"name":"UCLA School of Film and Television","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Day in the Life of Willie Faust, or Death on the Installment Plan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
