Brillante Mendoza, Eric Khoo, Garin Nugroho, Pen Ek Ratanaruang give voice to a region rich with traditions, ethnic groups, languages, politics, and religions. It is cinema, at its purest form, fighting for freedom of expression, documenting real lives of ordinary people, giving voice to the underdogs and the outcasts. The amalgamation of these aspects gives birth to an ultra-neo-realistic cinema language currently unique to films from this region.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1Dw9pxIkjixISZttPO1vLikyuoh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"},{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""},{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Southeast Asian Cinema – When the Rooster Crows","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
