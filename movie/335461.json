In doing so, they express a multitude of emotions--surprise, desire, anger, disbelief, excitement, boredom--ultimately leaving the impression that they are all part of one big conversation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Telephones","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
