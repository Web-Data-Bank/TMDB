The perplexing and unsettling sculpture challenges notions of violence and vulnerability, polarizing unsuspecting passers-by as it is moved around the US capital and dropped in front of the White House. Of particular interest is the contradiction between the transgressive way the work was created, and its later interpretation by the public.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vMYfzcBzDXCjqDQ2M9ILaWSE0BW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gun Porn","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
