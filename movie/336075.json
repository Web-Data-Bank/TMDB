I have broken apart the story and set it as a mechanical game with a series of repetitions where CINDERELLA is projected back and forth like a ping-pong ball between the hearth and the castle. She never succeeds in satisfying the requirements of the ‘Cinderella Game’. The film was shot MOS, the dialogue is lip-synched, and along with the out-front score and effects track magnifies the film’s sense of alienation.” — E.B. 1984","popularity":0.717,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":152796,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Jerome Foundation","origin_country":""},{"id":32040,"logo_path":null,"name":"New York State Council on the Arts","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1986-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cinderella","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":2}
