Including that of Athanasius Kircher, inventor of the Magic Lantern or \"Sorcererâ€™s Lamp\". The music, La lutte des Mages (The Struggle of the Magicians), was composed by Armenian mystic Georges Gurdjieff and Thomas De Hartmann. Gurdjieff thought of man as a kind of \"transmitting station of forces.\" To him, most people move around in a state of waking sleep, so he sought to provide aural conditions that would induce awareness.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/2zZwEkUNScoRHKVUDX6WCCZcRRV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Magician's House","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
