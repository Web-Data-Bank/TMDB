The concerto is appealing in its melodic material and the intricate interactions among the soloists and orchestra. The Choral Fantasy features a long piano solo that Beethoven wrote for himself, plus a choral melody that sounds like a preliminary sketch for the last movement of his Ninth Symphony. Both works pose unusual balance challenges, to which Barenboim and the recording engineers rise impressively.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3633,"logo_path":null,"name":"EMI Records Ltd.","origin_country":""},{"id":51474,"logo_path":null,"name":"Brilliant Media Gmbh","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2003-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beethoven - Choral Fantasy and Triple Concerto for Violin, Cello & Piano","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
