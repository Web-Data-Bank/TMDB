The outlaw is tormented by the memories of his past. The hunt will not cease for days, perhaps weeks. One afternoon, the far away figure of the fugitive becomes visible to the posse. A young army officer faces the doubtful glory of killing. But this is just the beginning, because in the desert, time is circular, justice a fragile dream, and reality a feverish reflection.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ijuyPPKZTTW9T5kYpbt9AsUMixj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2008-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Black Desert","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
