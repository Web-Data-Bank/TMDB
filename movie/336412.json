Set among the sub-Saharan Tuareg people, and reputedly the first feature film in their Tamashek language (which has no word for \"purple,\" hence the title). Resplendent in a purple robe and matching chopper, smoking hot guitarist Mdou Moctar arrives in a music-mad Niger town and sets about wooing a local beauty, clashing with his pious father, and fencing with the jealous king of the local scene (Kader Tanoutanoute, as wily and dapper as Morris Day) until their climactic six-string shootout.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dGoQ4OTTC5s6NdbQ3NgJQRkRJ9n.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109930,"logo_path":null,"name":"L'improbable","origin_country":""},{"id":102266,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sahel Sounds","origin_country":""},{"id":109931,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tenere Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NE","name":"Niger"}],"release_date":"2015-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rain the Color of Blue with a Little Red in It","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":5}
