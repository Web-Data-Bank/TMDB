Diagnosed in 1995 with the most lethal cancer known to medicine, a primary brain tumour called glioblastoma multiforme, he was given just a few months to live. But a natural born maverick, and rigorous scientist, Ben decided he woud not go down without a fight. Nineteen years later his story is an inspiration to patients the world over, whilst his case is dismissed by the medical community as just one of a handful of statistical outliers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"PATIENT ADVOCACY FILM","title":"Surviving terminal cancer","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
