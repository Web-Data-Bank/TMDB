Mehta has mellowed a bit in that time, and the program seems to reflect that.  The orchestra plays with its usual style and finesse, though the fireworks are kept to a minimum. There's a lot of beautiful legato playing to be had here, which is enjoyable to hear when so many ensembles feel the need to punch and pull at music these days. In a word, \"tradition\" is on display, and that's a good thing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kqBui6b8rMhsEzCFA5yCmxzS80o.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"New Year's Concert 2015","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
