In the vein of \"Best in Show\", where it's more about the dog owners than the dogs - \"All-Stars\" is about the adults involved in youth sports (parents, coaches, umpires, volunteers, board members, etc.) more than the kids. The end result is a funny, yet compelling spin on fast pitch softball as well as a unique state of affairs on the outlandish antics of a few crazed parents.","popularity":2.158,"poster_path":"/c8wy9HNWtztjItW1vMGGK2Na756.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51663,"logo_path":null,"name":"13 All Stars LLC","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All-Stars","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":13}
