The never-ending post-nuclear winter lingers - dust clouds raised by bomb explosions obscure the sun. The surface temperature of the Earth and the atmosphere is reduced, darkness prevents photosynthesis - plants and animals die. There is shortage of food - those few people who survived, walk with masks on to protect themselves from radiation. They are constantly scavenging the ruins of the cities in search of the things they need to survive: leftover food, clothing and medicines. Four wandering Musicians, walk the snow-covered street. Attracted by the glow coming from the windows of an abandoned industrial building they enter it. Amid the rubble, they see a levitating woman, bound by a chain to the ground. She is half-naked, has tattoos with strange patterns on her body, floating motionless in the air, her eyes are closed and her head is bowed down. When the Musicians get closer to the Angel, four Freaks come out of the ruins. They don't seem friendly.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Are The Fallen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
