This video is about what it feels like to leave a  place in which one has spent more time than any other place, and which was also  the place of my family life. I am somewhere else now. Itâ€™s about beginning of growing roots in a new place, new home, with new friends, new thoughts, experiences.  This video is also about video. When in 1949 I began filming with my Bolex, it  took me fifteen years to really master it so that my Bolex would do for me what I  wanted. When in 1987 I got my first Sony camera I thought it would be different.  But no. Only today, after working with the video camera for fifteen years, I feel like it had become an extension of my eye, my body, \"A Letter from Greenpoint\" being my first real video work.","popularity":1.134,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":109058,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anthology Film Archives","origin_country":""},{"id":1158,"logo_path":null,"name":"Love Streams Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Letter from Greenpoint","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
