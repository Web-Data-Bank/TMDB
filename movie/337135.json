All seems to be going as it should until the couples reach the altar, when the celebratory atmosphere is interrupted for a surprising public service announcement. Then song and dance continues until the happy couples depart, leaving behind a dwindling crowd and a few altar boys who carefully sweep up the rice that blankets the pavement like snow. The film doesn't attempt to defend--or discredit--the institution of marriage. Instead, it reveals the many subtle emotions surrounding the event, and raises questions about how the double standard regarding marriage affects gay and straight couples.","popularity":1.37,"poster_path":"/8rvNcduoY3aMDU6jwqzfNcolu7R.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":67385,"logo_path":null,"name":"Downstream Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"First Comes Love","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
