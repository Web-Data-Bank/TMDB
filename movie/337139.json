What a weird city you may think - but no. Lisbon is about being different, sarcastic, welcoming to foreigners even in an economic crisis. Different directors became fascinated by our strangeness. We became fascinated by these directors. The city is never the same in these four episodes, here in Lisbon.","popularity":1.163,"poster_path":"/15CqVSSHdyPyJ0d5PwWAqNQxAoe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17939,"logo_path":null,"name":"Indie Lisboa","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2015-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Episodes of a city's life","title":"Here in Lisbon","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
