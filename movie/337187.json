Hannah's mother Wilhelmine being hospitalized after a car crash, she volunteers to run her wedding agency, but finds it dangerously in debts and commandeers Barney's 'help' to save it. Barkeeper and bride client Jenny pawned the rings bought by groom Simon Riedel, an unsuspecting ministerial driver, who ignores her gambling addiction and semi-fraudulent first marriage.
