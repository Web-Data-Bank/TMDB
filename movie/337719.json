Everyone loves her dancing, but when a seemingly innocuous domestic accident takes her husband's life, a deep depression falls over Trini forcing her to quit the stage. Damien's behaviour, her 8-year-old son, becomes uncontrollably forcing Trini to call upon doctor after doctor to provide relief. When no answers can be found, there is left only one possible explanation - Damien has been possessed by a dark spirit! Trini begins a desperate quest to repair her shattered family. This search eventually leads to a defrocked priest called Father Lenin whose own severe spiritual crisis may not bode well for what lays ahead.
