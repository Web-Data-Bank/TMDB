Massimo's mind is plagued with images of his wife's violent death at the hands of a criminal gang involved in the production of snuff films. With every memory of the woman he loved replaced by unforgettable images of her horrific final moments, Massimo sees only one chance to take back his life: find the wealthy individual who commissioned the sickening murder - and make them pay. Barabba, a recently released convict, hopes to keep a promise he made to his father and start a new life with his brother, Spaccio, far from the violent world that they used to inhabit. Discovering that his brother is involved in the snuff gang, Barabba seeks to change things the only way he knows how: through violence and bloodshed.","popularity":0.873,"poster_path":"/aaWnEgScfKxVyBPd1mMTxQFUuz6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18418,"logo_path":"/jBFQBoj8dxi8Niofz8f4weuoS71.png","name":"Necrostorm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2015-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Revenge isn't fair... and blood follows blood","title":"Infidus","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":9}
