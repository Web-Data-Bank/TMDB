They appear to have a perfectly harmonious life together, a relationship based on deep mutual understanding and trust. So when Sarah needs a contraceptive, it's her mother who goes alone to the drugstore with her. However, under this idyllic surface there are tensions at work. Jeanne's on and off affair with Pierre does not save her from feeling lonely, and Sarah is bored by school. Both of them dream of an independent life, though neither will admit it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kyxXMjpCpNDty3sa9UNoaZkJ7x2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52464,"logo_path":null,"name":"Films Molière","origin_country":""},{"id":30173,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pierre Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":52463,"logo_path":null,"name":"Challenge Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1980-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Dearest","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
