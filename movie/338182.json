Rather than confront her, he hatches a plan to catch her in the act. This involves roping his best friend John into his stalking plot. Frank wants to record a confrontation between his girlfriend and the dude that she is allegedly cheating with. More to the point, Frank wants to beat the guy up on video. \"I'm going to make it look like he provoked me!\", Frank confidently tells John. John thinks that this is a terrible idea but goes along with it anyway. What unfolds over the course of this long afternoon are discussions about true friendship, what girls want and the right & wrong ways to handle certain life situations, with visits to drive-thru restaurants, strip clubs, the movies and the park mixed in. In the end, THE BRO DOWN unfolds in a confrontation that neither John nor Frank ever expected.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8iFMjfhjloXQ7amJPZk3WQKxnFv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":163309,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anhedenia Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Never underestimate how much time two grown men can waste.","title":"The Bro Down","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
