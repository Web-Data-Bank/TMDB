Their culture and beliefs intertwined and the knowledge of the ancients was gathered and reborn. Here were the very seeds of the Renaissance. But this world too quickly vanished. Greed, fear, and intolerance swept it away. Puritanical judgments and absolutism snuffed out the light of learning. Within a few centuries, the fragile union of these people dissipated like smoke. Brought to life by powerful, feature-film style re-creations, Cities of Light: The Rise and Fall of Islamic Spain explores the causes that destroyed the one civilization of pluralism and interfaith cooperation that for a few centuries lit the Dark Ages in Medieval Europe.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/duikbWp2lBed260oqtYCStAnkWD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-08-22","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cities of Light: The Rise and Fall of Islamic Spain","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
