Musicians, writers, architects, teachers; ordinary people in countries that are in a constant process of transforming their societies. Their testimonies address issues that go beyond what traditionally defines human rights.\r Presented in internal chapters within the documentary, the film deals with the understanding of individual and collective rights such as issues of gender, sexual orientation, education, communication, environment, indigenous peoples, public security, and military dictatorships. Human rights can be an element of integration in Latin America through a new vision of the concepts that define life as a basic right to be conquered.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2013-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"More Shipwrecked Than Sailors","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
