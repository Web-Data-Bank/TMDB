Their aim is to prepare a publication on the lives of the inhabitants of this remote island.  The tasks were personally assigned: one would study the language, another would study the fauna; another the traditions, institutions and family systems; another the plants and another the songs and stories. However, the blind trust in the western scientific objective clashes head-on with the values and customs of the natives. Therefore, from the very beginning, the head of the tribe does not cease to ask and express his surprise regarding some foreigners “who have not come to rob his land”.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/twRPYFiqmVTUcjnwJj4PwpShRaj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29188,"logo_path":null,"name":"Moana-Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1979-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":192,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Description of an Island","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
