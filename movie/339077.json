They save money to move out of the house. Due to his lack of self confidence, Aimo wastes their savings to turbo-boost his muscles. As conventional body building is not quite satisfactory, Aimo tunes himself up into a robot. Milla doesn't like the new Aimo-Robot and leaves him. Aimo´s heartache leads him to extreme measures as he also changes his heart into a metal one, one that doesn't hurt. Milla decides to steal Aimo heart: after all, a woman needs to have a man´s heart. Lovemilla is an anarchistic comedy trip, a comedy about love, a story about love, robots and bodybuilding.","popularity":0.675,"poster_path":"/vzvF2Xm1sekqYu0hwfYgYBtWn8d.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91900,"logo_path":"/ArXIGgKUYiOacPnE64UWhnUYWpa.png","name":"It's Alive Films","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2015-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Love and muscles on a crash course.","title":"Lovemilla","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":11}
