The movie also provides interviews with contemporary musicians from Argentina, who were influenced by Ayala. At the same time, the picture portrays the different landscapes of the country: the jungle and soil of Misiones (Ayala's native province), the folk festival in C贸rdoba and the urban environment of Buenos Aires; paying special attention to those places where Ayala's music circulate.  One of the most famous Argentine photographers, Lopez takes advantage of the cinematographic medium to stamp his visual aesthetics, which offer a very ironic, yet loving, approach to Argentina.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":52821,"logo_path":null,"name":"Leningrado Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2013-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Film","title":"Ram贸n Ayala","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
