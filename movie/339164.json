It is held every August in northern Budapest, Hungary, on Ã“budai-sziget (\"Old Buda Island\"), a leafy 108-hectare (266-acre) island on the Danube. More than 1,000 performances take place each year.  The week-long festival has grown from a relatively low-profile student event in 1993 to become one of the prominent European rock festivals, with about half of all visitors coming from outside Hungary, especially from Western Europe.
