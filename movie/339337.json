They have little physical evidence - their main source, Frank Serpico, won't wear a wire. They finally strike gold when a corrupt cop named William Phillips agrees to become their undercover agent, in exchange for immunity from a bribery charge. The evidence he eventually collects leads directly to the indictment of thirty New York cops. But the tables quickly turn when Phillips himself is convicted of a double-homicide. Three decades later and still in prison Phillips claims he's the victim of a massive police conspiracy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Patrolman P","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
