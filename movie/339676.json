When she died something inside him died too. In his waking life he suppresses his feelings so his subconscious is affected. This manifests in a reoccurring dream, with multiple layers of dream states, where he tries to reach his loved one in the afterlife. But he is not allowed to enter her world. In the end when he opens his eyes has he woken up or is he still dreaming? Will he forget or will he remain captive to her memory?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":53102,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filghi","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2011-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Idiosyncrasy","video":true,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
