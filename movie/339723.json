Ozzie Wright gets loose in New York on a borrowed board &amp; surfs himself into corners in Newport Beach. Chippa Wilson visits Southern California and rides unwanted waves all to himself. Dane Reynolds gets car jacked, and recovers nicely from injury with huge hacks often resulting in his famous cannonball exit. Alex Knost, Albee Layer, Spencer Pirdy, Jesse Steelman, Bobby Okvist, The Wedge, &amp; Jesus as himself all make small cameos.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/Af8B2PAjbszwQr1kiOOAsTbeUXB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Happy Beach","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
