The Palestinians have been trying to sell \"land for peace\" for decades: * Find out why this tactic will never work. * Learn what history has to say about Israel's borders. * How the Six Day War was a miracle from start to finish. * See how the Security Fence is both the most humane and effective measure to prevent terrorism. * Go inside the world of Palestinian media and watch incredible video clips of Palestinian politicians and clerics. You won't believe what you see-the lies, the incitement and the hatred, all caught on tape. Witness how Palestinian Propaganda seeks to rob the Jewish people of their rich history in the Land of Israel. Children are taught and encouraged to aspire to kill Jews and to become suicide bombers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hijacking The Holy Land: Palestine, Propaganda & Peace","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
