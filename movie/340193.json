As the residents galvanise, the corporation sends in someone to 'shake them up'. The Horror of The Dolls features a strong ensemble cast, inter-twined narratives and an iconic piece of London architecture. The narrative is underpinned by the wealth divide, untouchable high-finance, malleable politicians and the resolve of a community under assault. All wrapped in a blood-soaked and stylised horror thriller set against the breath-taking cityscapes of contemporary London. The Horror of The Dolls is a terrifying, atmospheric and unpredictable journey. Influences on the project are The Shining, Blue Velvet, The Wild Bunch, Short Cuts and Antichrist.","popularity":1.122,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Horror of The Dolls","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
