The documentary zeroes in on three determined gay athletes vying for a spot on the elite Sydney Convicts team: Aki, the Japanese outsider who worked tirelessly for two years so he could travel to Sydney; Brennan, a hunky Canadian jock who was built for contact sports but rejected by his former, straight teammates after they discovered he was gay; and Pearse, the Irish backpacker bullied in school, tired of being continually put down.\" - Brian Bromberger","popularity":1.446,"poster_path":"/w5PotOgnQl1AmdkkZVXe2s2zh7E.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":56502,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gang Gang Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2015-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Scrum","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":7}
