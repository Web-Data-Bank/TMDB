Director David Manougian unveils the captivating, intimate and redemptive story of Michael Nelms and his dog Tic, who, after becoming homeless, chose a life in a remote wilderness hideout over 'living under a bridge.' Micheal's stunning self-shot account is at once gritty and heartwarming, sorrowful yet awe-inspiring as we eavesdrop on a man surviving in a self-built cabin dealing with the physical and mental hardships of such a life. 'The Big Lonely' is a far too common American Story, told in an uncommonly personal full-length documentary.  -","popularity":0.874,"poster_path":"/76rjuKacNJZbBwbSxgkyZ9Garyr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Big Lonely","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
