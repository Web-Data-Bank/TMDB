The film is structured in three parts, which were made chronologically. In the first part, the filmmaker appropriates Peter Berlin’s outfits and poses, playfully attempting to embody Peter Berlin’s artistic persona. Each frame of the original 16mm film was then hand-painted to distort the image, producing an animated effect that prevents the viewer from seeing the full performing body. In the second part, a voice over relates a story riddled with anxiety about a potential meeting with Peter Berlin that is paired with images of mansions and window displays. The third and final section is an interview with Peter Berlin in his apartment, describing a moment of exchange that crosses lines of gender and generation, a moment where the identities of two filmmakers briefly coalesce.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aFd1MkCIGMnqYqiXG8RIQprTaMf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Encounters I May or May Not Have Had with Peter Berlin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
