As a metaphor for the nature and purpose of memory, the two main characters (portrayed by Jonas and Spalding Gray) play games with images of their past; but their efforts to restore their collective memories are futile, and they are reprimanded by the “Authority” for their attempts to recapture their past on a now-destroyed planet Earth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lKe1BuuAnuN6QBqJWeDE1733ePH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Double Lunar Dogs","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
