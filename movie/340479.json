'Smog Journeys' traces two families from two different backgrounds; one a mining family in Hebei province, and the other a trendy middle class family in Beijing. Both face a similar fate. Air pollution is one of China's most pressing environmental and health issues. Greenpeace calls for a shift from coal to clean renewable energy, as well as short term measures that better safeguard people's health.","popularity":0.685,"poster_path":"/p63UarYLY0k6kNaflcWZTiLtUxR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46709,"logo_path":null,"name":"Greenpeace International","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2015-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Clean Air Doesn't Come to Those Who Wait","title":"Smog Journeys","video":false,"vote_average":5.667,"vote_count":3}
