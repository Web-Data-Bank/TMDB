When mysterious Walter Keegan shows up offering to be their coach, captain Bubbles and the rest of his loopy, obnoxious teammates are so desperate to succeed, they agree to give him the job. Drilled into the ground with a fierce discipline they have never known, the team pushes beyond their aches and pains to gain not only redemption on the field, but more importantly, their self-respect.","popularity":1.176,"poster_path":"/7MWJFxvpTAHCwoggg2cbzbmveVA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2006-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Studs","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":3}
