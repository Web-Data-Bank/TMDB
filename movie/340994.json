Only four gondolas were officially donated by Italy, the others are in Toronto/Canada, Saint Petersburg/Russia, and Las Vegas/USA. The documentary recovers the history of the coming of this gondola to Brazil and reflects on why it rekindled the sense of Italian identity in the town. They even have the “Carnival of Venice”, and the festivity gathers hundreds of masked party goers in costumes made by local artisans.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/canI3TPlRjX0UlF2kFsVgSXinoW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Gondola for New Venice","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
