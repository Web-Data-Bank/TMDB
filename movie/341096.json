It is two different kinds of sale jobs working at cross-purposes. Oppenheimer takes the luster off the idealistic advertising images through video distortion and electronic interference and cuts-up both the video and audio tracks until the weird poetry of the chain gang prisoner's lessons in life and death gives the commercial presentation a creepy disconnection from any kind of living ideal. It follows A BRIEF HISTORY OF PARADISE AS TOLD BY THE COCKROACHES and MARKET UPDATE as another sharp jab at consumerism as an illusory promise.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2KEjvfRyw4iIuuNmLrdB6hX1Tv6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Postcard from Sun City, Arizona","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
