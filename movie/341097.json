Created while in the midst of production on the feature-length GLOBALIZATION TAPES, this brief film is Oppenheimer's most concentrated piece of socio-political commentary: a quick, colorful political cartoon of capitalism plucked out-of-context and set to a soundtrack that is both comic and somewhat sinister. The upbeat musical accompaniment only enhances the empty celebration of meaningless activity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ySUbARTmmfyZDgl0VelbEC8kqil.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Market Update","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":3}
