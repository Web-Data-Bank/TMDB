As the time limit is nearing for his grandfather's corpse, TV station boss Kelvin Chow (Kelvin Kwan, Tales from the Dark 2) looks to Charlie Jiang (Yuen Biao), whose ancestors performed the ritual for the Chow family, to complete the task. When Jiang refuses, citing his belief that the ritual is unethical, Chow enlists Nicky and Boo to coerce him into it. However, a series of accidents causes the corpse to be delivered to and left at Chow's TV station, unleashing a bloodbath.","popularity":2.979,"poster_path":"/c5Cc7IEON3zjAGdFm7IphuE9Gmn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74193,"logo_path":null,"name":"See Movie Limited","origin_country":""},{"id":17820,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mega-Vision Pictures (MVP)","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2014-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sifu vs. Vampire","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
