Hope North struggles on a shoe-string budget to provide a home and an education for children displaced by the civil war between the Lord's Resistance Army (L.R.A.) and the Uganda People's Defense Forces (U.D.P.F.) The students are a mix of former child soldiers, orphans and the abjectly poor. Mitigating the horrific effects of the war and focusing them on their future is a monumental task","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UG","name":"Uganda"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Thing That Happened","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
