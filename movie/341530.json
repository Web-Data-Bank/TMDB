Guaguasi joins the rebels and arrives in Havana at the end of Batista's dictatorship, and, in the midst of political turmoil, is swept off his feet by the mesmerising Marina. The story celebrates the vitality and lunacy of the Revolution period with surrealism, humor and sensuality and is a compassionate metaphor about the human condition.","popularity":0.78,"poster_path":"/i7gqf4w69yC3ceJgQuzhELalMxH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71481,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bolero Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DO","name":"Dominican Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1983-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guaguasi","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":4}
