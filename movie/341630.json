The basis is a written film treatment of the musician John Zorn, in which 254 scenes, bundled into 15 sequences, are captured in short, sometimes cryptic descriptions. Hills, very much in the style of a Harry Smith or Bruce Conner, has collected takes of radically differing origin for each of the 254 script directions and funneled them into a complexly ramified stream of associations. The sequence of scenes is underscored, or rather, interlocked, with pieces from the John Zorn composition The Bribe (1986), a musical tribute to crime fiction writer Mickey Spillane.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Arcana","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
