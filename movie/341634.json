The inner city landscape of Prague, its beautifully integrated accretion of structures, 1000 years history repressed but un-bombed, is viewed through the rhomboidal electricity-catchers on the tops of its moving trams. Trams define the rhythm of the city, &amp; so their looped noises define the rhythm of this film. As contrapuntal fixed point, the Zizkov Tower--built by the Soviets for signal-jamming broadcasts from the West &amp; looking like an about-to-launch ICBM--is accompanied by actual Cold War shortwave spy broadcasts.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Electricity","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
