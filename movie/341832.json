Carol Scrooge, the curmudgeonly owner of Biva Magazine (a sleazy skin publication), insists that her employees work on Christmas. However, on Christmas eve, Miss Scrooge is visited by three ghosts, each of whom shows her a different vision of Christmas, from Carol's lurid past of sexually manipulating her childhood friends to the meager Christmas celebrations of her present-day employee, Bob Hatchet and his wife, to a terrifying and sleazy vision of Christmas yet to come; each visit is infused with a barrel of laughs and a valuable lesson about the importance of giving and holiday spirit.","popularity":0.9,"poster_path":"/1AsYzRdYrYUb35cGw6X2YZzkQnI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":149821,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ambar Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1975-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Passions of Carol","video":false,"vote_average":5.333,"vote_count":3}
