During Carnival he meets Zulmira, a beautiful woman. On Ash Wednesday, the day of Iansã and Xangô, they pledge love and projects for many children. But time passes and Tonho returns to being the womanizer he had always been. Zulmira, daughter of Iansã, cannot stand Tonho's brazenness, and asks her saint-mother to wash her honor with blood. An Exu is invoked, who in the form of a woman, must make Tonho suffer and pay for his sins. Iaba is her name. Tonho's life starts to get complicated. To meet Iaba's needs, Tonho buys dresses, perfumes and jewelry. But the pomba-gira is not content. She wants to make a worker out of Tonho. No longer supporting Iaba's demands, Tonho decides to look for a terreiro to unload. He receives strength from his orixá, Xangô, and starts a quest to get rid of Iaba's clutches.","popularity":0.672,"poster_path":"/1LFKd3wqgPTJyZwkQoB9h16ioeL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"1977-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Love and Betrayal.
