He tells Mickey how he can't get close to the girl of his dreams; he's overheard by Dave, a smooth operator, who insists that Alabam leave everything to him. He contrives to have Alabam and Mickey wreck Alabam's car in the girl's front yard, then he arrives, posing as a doctor, asking the residents of the house if they'll let the injured boy come inside while the doctor examines him. Meanwhile, Mickey gets a look at the girl's cousin and feigns injury so that now both lads are in beds upstairs while Dave, the doctor, conjures foul-tasting treatments. The fly in the ointment is the girl's crusty uncle, who may stand between the lads and their true loves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8JwPQoG3K55v8yavGyPK1FDVYNg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1930-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Doctor's Orders","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
