La Fuggitiva is also a film in which a child actress takes a prominent role. In this sentimental drama, the little girl suffers for and rebels against the loneliness and neglect stemming from the lack of a mother and a loving family setting.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/oG0uXxPY1QRRYohbshsuGOPSAqJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1874,"logo_path":null,"name":"Industrie Cinematografiche Italiane (ICI)","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1941-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La fuggitiva","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
