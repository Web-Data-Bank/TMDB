Produced in Wilkes-Barre, PA., it has crisp editing, fast action, and carefully lit and composed interiors and lush pictorial exteriors. This is a serial of great complexity with the director, the photographer and title-maker always in absolute control. The extraordinary rhythmic momentum of the film is never lost despite the films complex plot turns. This is the best of the surviving serials from the silent era.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sQ0LXxI9pIPjAHcujr9IyKB5PP1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1920-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":236,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Woman in Grey","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
