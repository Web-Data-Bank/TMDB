Schaller's lovely and sometimes deeply emotional, 63-minute journal/essay film offers a look at the making of the Wausau, Wisconsin classic, including interviews with the one surviving cast member and the relatives of others who appeared in the movie.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When You Wore a Tulip and I Wore a Big Red Rose","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
