Despite the seven minutes of turbulent action, it is actually a slow film: in the war against Kreon, one of Antigone's brothers fights for the king, one against him. Both die. One of them is buried; the other is left lying on the street. Antigone goes against the king's wishes and wants to bury her brother. As a punishment Antigone is buried alive behind a wall. Her fianc√©, Haimon dies, overcome with grief. Haiman's mother, Eurydike, is so upset by his death that she hangs herself. And just as the old soothsayer predicted, the king himself finds no happiness from all this death: he is killed. That makes 6 deaths, even though the war is over.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1964-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Antigone","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
