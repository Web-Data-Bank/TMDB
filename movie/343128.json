The film is a simple observation of a group of staff and teenage pupils in the corridors, art rooms, exclusion room, and an empty classroom used as a makeshift mosque. With panoramic views of London, the seventh floor is a place of partial escape where the relative freedom of activity and empty space are the questionable outcomes of a disintegrating education system.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seventh Heaven","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
