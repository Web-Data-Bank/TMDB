Yoav recalls his first encounter with Pasolini’s Teorema, back when he was still a soldier in the Israeli army. Nadav Lapid has created an alter ego director. In just a few scenes, Lapid condenses the moments that have ultimately altered the director’s life. Lama? is an extremely personal film that tangibly illuminates the vast potential inherent in cinema.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8yFdPZOLD5k9iH1jY0jabs6Cibp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Why?","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
