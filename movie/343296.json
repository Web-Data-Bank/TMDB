The charming portrait of this young girl is sublimated with incessant tender zooms in and out on her face and her discreet smile, to accordion music. Itâ€™s a portrait-film, a dream-like film that has no contemporary equivalent to its formal and symbolic content. It is not a declaration of love, but a brief moment of admiration for beauty and the noble side of human nature.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Portraits of a Young Eastern-European Jewish Orphan Girl","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
