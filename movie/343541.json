This excellent tome contains close analysis by Bruce Jenkins of film-school staples like A Movie and Looking For Mushrooms as well as of later works like Valse Triste and Take the 5:10 to Dreamland. The 1969 film is called Permian Strata, a title which works in conjunction with the images and the song that makes up the film's soundtrack to form a colossal pun. So often experimental film gets pigeonholed as overly serious, boring, stuffy, or requiring an expertise in filmmaking processes to fully appreciate.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jArPtBBH8OdFCnXwKKO89ziSWav.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1969-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Permian Strata","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
