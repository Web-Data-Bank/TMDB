My association with the Bush goes back a long time, and thinking that one day it might not be there tied my stomach in knots. I felt physically sick...like seasick...really off. Images were fermenting in my head, but I couldn’t see how to film what I was feeling. How do you film a blinding headache? A churning premonition? I tried shooting toothpaste glasses, filters, but nothing worked...until I found a way of doing it where I had these household glasses spinning at very fast speed in front of the lens. I didn’t want the film to be didactic, like Scars...more a veiled and brooding warning about impending loss.” (Paul Winkler)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mj1JTrDB5KtAnZa7gRTyENsrC3z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1994-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Green Canopy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
