That he was even champion was a bit of a surprise. He’d taken the title with an upset of Ezzard Charles the year before. Marciano on the other hand, was the coming star. He’d hammered Joe Louis into retirement in 1951, a sad fight that many saw as a changing of the guard. Fans were eager to see the Rock take on Jersey Joe—but few expected to witness one of the all-time great heavyweight fights.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6OuYusA3DoCdSvWHjS1ncjnBVCe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60,"logo_path":"/1SEj4nyG3JPBSKBbFhtdcHRaIF9.png","name":"United Artists","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1952-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rocky Marciano vs. Joe Walcott","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
