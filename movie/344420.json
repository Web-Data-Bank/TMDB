Setting an ambush at the crossroads, he kills the musician Jedediah Graham before the man can sell his soul. Chasseur then lies in wait for the Devil. Instead, the blood-soaked Chasseur encounters the Devil's lawyer, weaselly Mycroft Coney. What follows is a biblical battle of wills between the brutal, conscienceless Chasseur and the fast-talking Mycroft. Mycroft fights for his life as Chasseur pumps him for information on the Devil. Eventually, Chasseur gets what he wants... and more.","popularity":1.344,"poster_path":"/qGIzz8vpueZVDTNgqMLHFCE5Zmi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chasseur","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
