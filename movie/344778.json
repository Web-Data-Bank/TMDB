His virtuosity and constant creativity in both a modern mainstream format and on funkier grooves seem effortless. As Is...Live at the Blue Note contains a CD (the first seven selections) and a DVD. \"Smash,\" \"Feediop,\" the ballad \"Remembering\" and an overlong \"Caravan\" (the one non-original) are featured in both formats while three songs are different. Cohen takes many solos and is always a prominent force in the ensembles. Pianist-keyboardist Sam Barsh and drummer Mark Guiliana communicate very well with Cohen while trumpeter Diego Urcola and tenor soprano saxophonist Jimmy Greene add plenty of fire during their guest appearances","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pEWFoY6tTBXxjKsd8zSbu0T0HAr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Avishai Cohen - As Is...Live at the Blue Note","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
