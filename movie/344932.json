On the train, he shares the compartment with three men. One of them, the bearded, hefty Blasius is polite but at times acts very confused. At the end station the two boys meet, but they must first of all get rid of Blasius, who lifts them up together with their luggage and carries them away. Leipzig is packed with tourists who have gathered for the famous Fair. The eccentric bearded fellow deals effectively with the traffic jam in front of the station. Blasius's fellow travelers from the train - inventors Prantl and Pirwitz, are at the fairground, boasting of their new invention and claiming it to be the greatest surprise of the entire Fair.","popularity":0.654,"poster_path":"/AkypJs6OKQtI5BVR35nAsuxvqdc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1931,"logo_path":"/5erHhgvym2cTORao8ajtn2gbiTH.png","name":"Filmov√© studio Barrandov","origin_country":"XC"},{"id":602,"logo_path":"/pVsXRFbYVDe5BhsATCAh1rt5F0k.png","name":"DEFA","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","name":"Czechoslovakia"},{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"}],"release_date":"1975-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Abenteuer mit Blasius","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
