They take off in his car to Washington and begin an affair. Beth, a lonely romance-novel addict, is hopelessly enamored; Ricky is just in it for the (constant) sex. Beth's longing to visit California and Ricky's longing for quick cash leads them into a desperate situation. Director Jost uses a variety of avant-garde visual and narrative techniques, such as montage, collages, split screens and lengthy, tongue-in-cheek monologues to tell the tragicomic story of two complete losers in love.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xxEbhuPsB5bydYYynDFegJJvVqU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":55795,"logo_path":"/5GDnpABmYFAAptHwYx8jMY4rkeq.png","name":"Complex","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1993-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"12 Movements To The Only Conclusion","title":"Frameup","video":false,"vote_average":6.143,"vote_count":6}
