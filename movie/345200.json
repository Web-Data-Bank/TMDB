When the Kafkaesque routine of a man who is alone to the point of imploding into nothingness begins to fall apart, unexpected love and friendship seep in through the cracks. The film was shot on a handy cam over the course of several days during which a number of scenes of comedy and drama were improvised and gradually built up to a story-arch that was really never put down on paper form.","popularity":0.653,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2012-02-21","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El señor","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
