These are shocking testimonies about the burden of female identity: illegal abortions performed in the '50s without anesthesia; the dynamics of the relationship between husbands and wives; the inability to participate in the enjoyment of sex. A mixture of documentary and narrative filmmaking, Davis' powerful film is a personal female journey to deconstruct the burden of inherited identity. - Stela Jelincic","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kRpuTvClMEvDT2OrbTSsXv0C4aG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Preponderance of Evidence","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
