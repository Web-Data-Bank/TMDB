Her mother, a filmmaker, started filming her to document the seizures. When Agnes’ baby-babbling disappears and her attention turns inward, one suspects autism. All experience and education is futile, the mother is left tending to her child, who needs constant care and seems to slip away from all communication. Agnes can’t speak, she doesn’t respond to verbal language and she can’t point her finger to show what she wants. Her ever-present older sister wants to play, but she gets no response. However, Agnes does have a language. She expresses her will, anger and joy. The Hummingchild gives a glimpse into a mother’s journey, over a span of five years, towards contact with her daughter.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hummingchild","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
