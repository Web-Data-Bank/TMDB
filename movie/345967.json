Openly gay, Levita is labeled a Binabinaine by the Kiribatese, a term to describe her gender identity and identification as female while being born male. Obsessed with dance, Levita and her fellow Binabinaines perform their unique brand of Polynesian dancing to audiences on the island. 'Levita' is an intimate portrait of a remote community, a world in which dance, sisterhood and desire become an affirmation of acceptance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KI","name":"Kiribati"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Levita","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
