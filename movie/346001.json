This is a film about intimacy and friendship. Written in the first person, it places Boris and Brussels in the center of the universe, here represented by the crazy, vertiginous, endless spiral of the biblical Tower. It is Boris's diary and self-portrait. He plays himself on screen (as do the cast of a hundred who also allowed themselves to be \"Babelized\")","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/z5bWUaXCYUQwAOU9wC9jUQyGAQK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":380,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Babel: A Letter to My Friends Left Behind in Belgium","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":4}
