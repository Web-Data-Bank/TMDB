Strangled by debt, governments and public administrations all over Europe act like any indebted family: they try not only to reduce costs, but attempt to replenish their coffers by putting their most valued family possessions on the market. More often than not, this includes part of the countries' historical and natural heritage: castles, islands, mountains, beaches, palaces, ancient arenas and archaeological sites.\r But who really owns these properties? Aren't they our common heritage, our history that will end up in private or corporate hands and will no longer be accessible to all?\r Or is the private sector more efficient in managing these properties? And if so, who decides on the best deal? Are there democratic proceedings for the sale of our common good? The people of Europe want accountability.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":1715,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films du Point du Jour","origin_country":""},{"id":73764,"logo_path":null,"name":"Graffiti Doc","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2014-08-26","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"How would you feel if the state sold the mountain above your village to a big multinational?","title":"Europe for Sale","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
