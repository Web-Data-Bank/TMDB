Following the parallel experiences of several tenants of a luxury hotel, we witness the ways in which different personalities react when faced with the realization that something very fundamental to their lifestyle is utterly wrong. A man finds himself inexplicably unable to leave his room due to an overwhelming dread that something dire has been neglected. An obliviously decadent movie star spirals into stardom and terrible consequence. A devoted Concierge embarks on a mission to dispatch his beloved hotel with dignity. And the faded ghost of a woman, all too aware of the trajectory of her opulent home, slowly and quietly relinquishes control.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Pink Hotel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
