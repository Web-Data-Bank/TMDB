Four factories in the metropolitan area of Mexico City are taken as spots for anthropological exploration. Documenting industrial landscapes, factories, bosses, workers, machines and commodities, the film shows a reflection on how these relationships have an imprint on society outside the factories. This is a testimony on the dignity of workers and their daily labor, with all the effort it entails and how it is rendered invisible by consumer society.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vj1XFIRIF4OolT4Bk3mSfVjztAv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tesis laboral","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
