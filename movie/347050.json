Eight of them live together under constant supervision and care. They are all in the first phase of the disease: bouts of lucidity, forgetfulness and falling into oblivion constantly alternate. The patients live their lives, as long as they're capable. The film is a 'tranche de vie': a portrait of the daily coming and going of people in that particular and ditto state. It is also the portrait of a brutal disease that irreversible expropriates the memory from the characters. Eventually the characters will have changed. Because of their illness, they may have been disappeared completely, physically or mentally.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":56959,"logo_path":null,"name":"Associate Directors","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2010-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lost Down Memory Lane","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
