Full Frontal Nerdity guaranteed!  Stand-up mathematician Matt Parker (Discovery Channel You Have Been Warned), experiments maestro Steve Mould (ITV1 I Never Knew That About Britain) and geek songstress Helen Arney (BBC2 Coast) mix astonishing science with statistically significant comedy, plus experiments that electrify their audiences – sometimes literally.  Since their last smash hit tour show Full Frontal Nerdity, the Nerds have filmed their first DVD (available now) and racked up over a million views on YouTube for their experiments, songs and stand-up. As well as sell-out shows all over the UK, the Nerds have performed at Shakespeare’s Globe, Hammersmith Apollo with Robin Ince and Brian Cox, The British Library, TED, Udderbelly and Latitude Festival.","popularity":1.084,"poster_path":"/6Xd7xldG4wloFLMoXbVdXQyk5NW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Full Frontal Nerdity","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":2}
