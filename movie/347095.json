Some weren't originally written for cello, but she had them transcribed. Some were songs for voices, which goes with Wieder-Atherton saying in an earlier film she made with Chantal Akerman that she aspires to play the cello in a way that it carries the specificity of emotion of the human voice. She explains at the beginning of both parts how she feels each country in the region has it's own personality expressed in its music, coming from its individual history and culture, but that each land in the area is also 'impregnated' as she puts it, by the others, so there are certain elements that run throughout.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jDkIYA1u6PE6zvKOU3QjrWYOpuv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33562,"logo_path":null,"name":"AMIP","origin_country":""},{"id":101616,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chemah I.S.","origin_country":""},{"id":29651,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cléa Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2009-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"East with Sonia Wieder-Atherton","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
