But in the meantime here's Volume 3. Volume three of the Jackass series contains a random, haggard selection of segments and bits that aired on our crappy little television show. Memorable moments in this half-ass collection include the recitation of the Gettysburg Address by Johnny Knoxville while a beard of leeches is applied to his ruggedly handsome face, Chris Pontius stripping down for the pleasure of five other dudes, Wee Man and Preston Lacy pulling a \"poo switcheroo\" with a porta-potty, Dave England digging through the trash and unearthing a tasty treat in a diaper, and a bunch of other absurd stunts, pranks and queer misbehavior from our bumbling cat and crew of idiots.","popularity":3.375,"poster_path":"/zdQYkdHplI9TvZSem3GLWiRQSho.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6328,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dickhouse Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jackass Volume Three","video":true,"vote_average":6.891,"vote_count":23}
