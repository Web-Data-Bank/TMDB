Design Onscreen recently released Modern Tide: Midcentury Architecture on Long Island, an 86-minute documentary film by Jake Gorst about the times, places and people that converged to create lively, free, experimental designs for mostly modest houses that sit lightly on their sites. It’s also a lament against their wanton destruction and a plea to preserve what’s left.” —Modernism Magazine, Fall 2012.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Midcentury Architecture on Long Island","title":"Modern Tide","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
