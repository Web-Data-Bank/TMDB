Besides playing the usual venues they challenged themselves and played in buses, caf√©s and for Indian tribal elders. Music video director Emmett Malloy followed the band and managed to capture both the special tour, extraordinary concert versions of the band's minimalist, raw, blues-inspired rock songs and the special relationship between the extroverted Jack White and the introspective Meg White - a formerly married couple who for a long time claimed to be siblings. The film makes striking use of the band's concert colors: red, white and black.","popularity":1.851,"poster_path":"/ddYQd5ARAA6ZpDC0WuCOIdZeO2U.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The White Stripes: Under Great White Northern Lights","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":26}
