Born and raised in the Ukraine in the period between Stalin and Gorbatschow he left the country in the 80s. In his Installations and his numerous paintings Kabakov creates a world of its own, which leaves the heaviness of socialist and post-socialist life far behind. The film links Ilya Kabakovs artistic spaces with insights into Russian everyday life, which itself sometimes appears like an installation by the artist.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":2027,"logo_path":"/rvHnU0XJniilOjf6IK9ZdXTUKE5.png","name":"3sat","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":41570,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmtank","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2009-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flys and Angels","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
