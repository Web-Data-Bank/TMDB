Meredith Langston always longed to have children. She finally makes this happen when she adopts two young adolescent girls. However, her now idyllic world sours rapidly and dream veers to nightmare when she quickly finds that she is unable to cope with their increasingly strange behaviour. Desperate, she seeks the help of two journalists working for a local TV programme ‘SOS Adoption’. Unfortunately it is all for nothing, especially when the reporters discover that there is another presence in the house.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2VuuOtQhKeapt61zDP0ebUBGnaw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2014-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hostile","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
