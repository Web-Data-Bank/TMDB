They sneak into hundreds of fur farms. When their images are publicized it causes media feasts and public outrage, year after year. However, the industry always strikes back. Nothing changes.  A new approach is needed.  So, psychologist Frank Nervik tells the fur industry that he plans to become a fur farmer. He asks for training. Nervik is accepted as one of them, and starts learning the trade secrets. Without anybody knowing, he films his training with a hidden camera.","popularity":0.625,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":57526,"logo_path":null,"name":"Electric Parc","origin_country":""},{"id":29063,"logo_path":null,"name":"Piraya Film","origin_country":"NO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2014-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Undercover in the fur industry","title":"Inside Fur","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
