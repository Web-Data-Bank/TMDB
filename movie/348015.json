Gabriel, who was more widely known as the “Mountain Hawk,” led  an outlaw’s life which was either that of a lowly criminal or daring  do-gooder, as accounts of the man’s life vary depending on the  point of view of the interviewee. As Rosendo digs deeper for the  truth, it becomes apparent that Gabriel was a heroic figure worthy  of the song his brother plans to write in his commemoration—if only  Rosendo can overcome his growing envy for his brother’s immortal  status as a swashbuckling rebel.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hHqqNDVT60h69duGm0ofX115ROg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2002-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El gavilán de la sierra","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4}
