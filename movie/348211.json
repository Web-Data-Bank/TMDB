Telling the tale of a violent ex-cop searching for the man who killed his partner, the film takes an unexpected turn when he encounters drug lord Plastic Man and a tribe of LSD enthusiasts. What follows is both literal and metaphorical mayhem as the boundaries of the film start collapsing and our idea of what's real is pushed to its very limits.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eIW1pLfR9rnTKofcKzft6cIp6VQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95380,"logo_path":null,"name":"Apogee Film Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1973-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dalmas","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3}
