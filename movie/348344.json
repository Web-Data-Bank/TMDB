John Larroquette plays his usual rude, selfish character-here named Gus - and he suckers Willy (Gregory Harrison) into his scheme to rob the mansion. The two losers have to try to figure out how to sell the valuable but high-profile item without getting busted. They travel the world looking for potential buyers but always end up short. Everyone can see that they are novices in the art world and buffoons in general.","popularity":0.804,"poster_path":"/4qHbGpe6wTJ1V1Set9VTcihzJ0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10278,"logo_path":null,"name":"MGM/UA Television","origin_country":"US"},{"id":42574,"logo_path":null,"name":"Catalina Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1988-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hot Paint","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
