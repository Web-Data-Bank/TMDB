Indeed, the fatigue is grosse, or hugely weighty, she who has condemned herself to carrying the weight of the world on her shoulders like the Titan Atlas. But aren’t such dark and lonely burdens meant to become as light, as beautiful and fragile as soap bubbles in the hands of an artist? Holding the world in the palm of her hand… it floats effortlessly at the palm’s surface as though, imbued with magical powers, the artist has truly resurrected the youth of humanity from the depths of the ages – bringing to life the magisterial dawn we had thought too far off to ever be seen again, yet which captivates us as easily as a magic lantern does a child.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":58048,"logo_path":"/66Vk4FFCl61tPs3iBleAX2sTfkv.png","name":"Silex Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grosse fatigue","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
