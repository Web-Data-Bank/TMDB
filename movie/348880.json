A powerful PR machine built their fame, and soon their primary objective was to invent new and creative ways to get kicked off stage without actually playing. Narrated by 'Alice Cooper', Skum ROCKS!, is a genre-bending film described by some as a true-life 'This is Spinal Tap', and by others as an independent 'Rock of Ages'. 'Skum Rocks!' chronicles the rise, fall, and return of this infamous band, giving new life to the tale of 'The Emperor's New Clothes'.","popularity":0.665,"poster_path":"/sAywbVS5eutup0qwwdlOr4yyRFP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Play like the music doesn't matter.","title":"Skum Rocks!","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":1}
