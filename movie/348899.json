Following on from the 1982 Commonwealth Games Protest it was decided that 1988 was the ideal chance to make a stand. With convoys travelling from every corner of Australia to protest against the “celebration of a nation”, the march was an affirmation of survival and a reminder that white Australia had a black history. The protest instigated public debate about the concept of Australian history, the position of Aboriginal people in contemporary society and self determination. The events of 1988 changed white and black Australia forever leading to the establishment of the numerous peak Indigenous organisations, fostered a new generation of leaders, shifted attitudes towards the way we celebrate Australia Day but more importantly in marked a turning point in our approach to Australia’s history.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/zWXdr16WpGm0nx22aVFU3TbS5QG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"88","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
