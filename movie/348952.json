An inveterate womanizer behind his long-suffering fiancée’s back, Brooks targets exactly the wrong alluring intern for an after-work dalliance, setting off a chain of fateful events that will burn bridges and mark his future. Director Miller brings a grand sense of melodrama to this story of broken faith, betrayed trust, and the quest for forgiveness.","popularity":1.139,"poster_path":"/u3XosmNJCixjUrnAeNQbnLR6vp1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What's love got to do with it?
