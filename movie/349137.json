Nowhere on Earth is hit worse than the Korean peninsula. Ha-jin, a sly, savvy orphan, prowls the rubble of a broken, barely functioning Busan wracked by daily tremors. Her petty crimes land her in jail, and from there the clutches of human traffickers — and finally far out to sea, rescued (or rather, kidnapped?) by a ragtag band of pirates seeking the precious crystals at the heart of a volcanic island. To reach their prize, they’ll need to defeat the island’s fearsome guardian, the legendary volcano whale. And to do that, they’ll need Ha-jin’s special talent for summoning whales. But is her rare power a blessing, or a curse?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2vfqxeDBLJZaf4uzVF977Qbg3ZI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2014-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Crimson Whale","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
