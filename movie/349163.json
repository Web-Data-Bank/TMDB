It's the closing months of the war in occupied Holland and some women unravel a beautiful bedspread in order to knit 55 socks to barter for food. Reaching back into his childhood memories, Hoedeman has made a simple, poetic film of rare beauty.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"55 Socks","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":2}
