At the first successful exhibition of his works, he meets a young man, Lee Sang, a poet with really queer character. Soon Lee Sang and Bon-woong become close friends, and they meet almost every day and enjoy all kinds of interesting and usual events. Lee Sang goes to visit Bakchon (a health resort) for medical treatment. Bon-woong follow him. At Bakchon, Lee and Bon-woong meet Keum-hong (a famous waitress) and both fall in love with her.
