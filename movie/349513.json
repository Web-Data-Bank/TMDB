These two have never succeeded in life, and are constantly in and out of prison. Two others who happen to be in the same boat as Deok-Bae and Dal-Soo are ex-convicts. They have threatened to commit suicide unless traffic and unemployment issues are resolved. They are also unlucky enough to have been spotted at the scene of a crime. While these four are making big plans for their first success, the city becomes wrapped up in a serial murder case. In the meantime, an investigating team of veteran cops is formed in order to solve this case.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/syYedN3fOXQbHrV6TfHhcO8KL11.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26212,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dong-a Export","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"1998-08-22","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Happenings","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
