In addition, various presenters will help highlight the historical impact of Wonder's songs on music and our culture.  In the 56-year history of the GRAMMY Awards, Wonder is the only artist to have received Album Of The Year honors in three out of four consecutive years with Innervisions, Fulfillingness' First Finale, and the seminal Songs In The Key Of Life. With a catalog that is one of the richest treasure troves in American music, his songs are still revered and influential today and his longevity as one of America's — and the world's — most respected and beloved artists is well earned.","popularity":2.092,"poster_path":"/9O2XwfefWGwioRFa9GrvzJL8t3G.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4898,"logo_path":"/nm8d7P7MJNiBLdgIzUK0gkuEA4r.png","name":"CBS","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-02-26","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stevie Wonder: Songs in the Key of Life - An All-Star Grammy Salute","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
