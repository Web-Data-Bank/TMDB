Not because of his job: he is a successful sales manager. But on account of the various wrongdoings committed by his kin. First, there is his daughter Nicole, who has just developed an infatuation with a young man who is not only a revolutionary student but the the son of a Sicilian mobster as well. Then he has to cope with Bernard, his brother-in-law, a ladies'man who has been vamped by one of the sexy daughters of the Sicilian. Let's not forget Albert, his own brother, an avant-garde filmmaker also in trouble with Lombardi, the omnipresent gangster. To crown it all, Maryse, his domestic worker, is a Maoist militant!... In the end, poor Gabriel can't take it anymore. He hits the road and calls it quits.","popularity":0.68,"poster_path":"/5g7TojO34Via1DPqV3RKRSnJS3k.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1970-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ces messieurs de la gâchette","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":3}
