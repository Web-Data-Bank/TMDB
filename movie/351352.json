Soon, the creatures of the night gather in an improvised auditorium in the old mill, and the place is soon rocking and rolling with the singing and dancing provided by the night-crawling nightclub crowd. The festivities cease when dawn breaks and the creatures and things that stir in the night become quiet again.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1939-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What Happens at Night","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
