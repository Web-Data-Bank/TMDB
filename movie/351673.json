The catch is they have to put it together themselves. Of course, with the family's intelligence, this isn't an easy task. Examples: Paw is enrolled in measuring tape when Milford lets go too suddenly and when Maw carries a board, it starts vibrating to the point where it carries her into the air dropping her into the washing machine (Paw thinks he's watching Maw on TV). Finally, the house is finished and the family moves inside. Unfortunately, Paw steps on a loose floorboard causing the house to disassemble into a pile of rubble.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":8520,"logo_path":null,"name":"Walter Lantz Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1953-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Plywood Panic","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
