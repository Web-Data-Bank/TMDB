Samantha is her best friend and wears earrings in the shape of bones and leopard print leggings, like The Flinstones. There's also a pissed off pimp who never takes his sunglasses off. And a gypsy woman who smokes cigars and knows everything. And Hollywood star pictures glued to raunchy walls. And a parking lot full of whores, light bulbs and parties. And Jesuschrist. And a Hindu man passed out because of a blow job. And a lot of night exteriors, New York's, to be precise. And a pair of plastic tits that have disappeared. NIGHT FLOWERS is the punky and surreal fairytale in which all of this comes together to make sense. A short film about friendship, bravery and the ability to have dreams in other to survive. Maybe, deep down, that's what life is: a funny, tender and offbeat road trip, filled with feelings, in the search of a pair of plastic missing tits.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A3RvuF87Od4Qngy95OshrnoGdce.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Go to Hollywood, grab your tits and make us all proud, ok kid?","title":"Night Flowers","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
