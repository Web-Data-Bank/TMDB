Hunter: The Modern Prophets","overview":"Four days before his wedding, Howard William Hunter, 24, played his last engagement as a professional musician. From then on, whether as a successful corporate attorney, church leader in the Los Angeles ares or apostle of the Lord, Howard's life was dedicated to serving others. His focus on temple service began as a young bishop and carried through to his presidency as he challenged the Church membership to increase temple worthiness and attendance. His tenure as the 14th President of the Church lasted only nine months, but he left a wonderful legacy that blesses us today.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sgLQ3d8jD6YF2s5pGzGaaOewhRY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Howard W.
