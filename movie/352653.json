Loitering youngsters, moped girls: in any case, there is no sign of parents or school. The girls laugh, are silent and quarrel, joke about `nice tits', flirt with a Moroccan boy (and call him a fucking fundamentalist when he walks off with another girl). In between, they ride their mopeds. A loosely acted draft of two young lives.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":22519,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dutch Mountain Movies","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2005-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brommermeisjes","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
