The island is a magnet for the scum of the earth, as well as a few honest guys who were framed. Into this den of iniquity swims socialite Dorothy Sebastian, who jumped off a yacht after apparently murdering her lecherous host. To remain on the Island, Sebastian is told that she must pay $5,000 to head honcho Fred Kohler -- and if she hasn't got the money, it is implied, there are other methods of collection.","popularity":1.341,"poster_path":"/yMl1CEtyM0P7otxd77nqNpnB58L.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":36236,"logo_path":null,"name":"Showmen's Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1933-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ship of Wanted Men","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
