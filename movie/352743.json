She decides to protect her triplets from the scheming leader of rival world Zephyr, General Norak, by sending her children to faraway Earth. Two decades later, the lives of the three estranged siblings intersect in the most unexpected way. Everything they know and love is suddenly threatened when General Norak zeroes in on them from light years away. The spiteful alien wants unconditional, uncontested power over Xenoa, but he is unable to achieve this as long as the true heirs to the throne are still alive. He is so hellbent on ruling Xenoa that he doesn't think twice about turning sibling against sibling in his quest for power.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":59976,"logo_path":null,"name":"Xion Films","origin_country":""},{"id":59977,"logo_path":null,"name":"Asia Pacific College School of Multimedia Arts","origin_country":""},{"id":59978,"logo_path":null,"name":"Visual Camp","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2007-08-22","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Three siblings.
