Last film made in exile by Bressane, it mimics the experimental concept of \"quasi-cinema\" by Hélio Oiticica. It consists of a fragmentary experience of freedom, in super-8 and 16mm, in a code out of time, out of the square, while recreating (with different cameras) the wild and sensitive look that Oiticica dedicated to cinema.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/h4MULGOWuLpMvj7QYDolNzdDjae.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lágrima Pantera","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":5}
