It seems he desperately wants to speak her, for what might be the last time. When Lisette is getting her mother out of the backyard, the man is still talking, telling Lisette should say to her mother he loves her. The sound of an approaching ambulance can be heard. When his wife finally gets on the phone, it's only a remarkable short conversation. She's asking him about his flight and to come back soon because Lisette misses him much.
