Thought lost until quite recently, this inscrutably-titled film is described as a 'pop fantasy' and offers an intriguing look at 60s sex and politics from a black British perspective.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zeT35NWO9cIdrvveOb4H1PIcIhc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29327,"logo_path":null,"name":"Space Films","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":109077,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stria Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1969-08-06","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Death May Be Your Santa Claus","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":5}
