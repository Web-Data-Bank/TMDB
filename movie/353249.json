With each successive scream, the camera point of view hurtles at high velocity along the length of the hallway in decreasing increments. The corridor and the cinematic structuring of the camera's advance act as metaphors for passage and transition between two worlds, bridged by the individual's cathartic screams. Ultimately, the image of the man at the end of the corridor is transformed into a Polaroid still that is literally washed away.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-08-06","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Space Between the Teeth","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
