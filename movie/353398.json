Think \"Jaws\" but much funnier and with a bear instead of a shark. It's a total comedy of errors that takes a comical look at just how far we'll go to preserve our relationships.","popularity":1.276,"poster_path":"/6sNDW3JZ0ydNhd2U1FXFHMyUX6b.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60256,"logo_path":null,"name":"Seven Twenty One","origin_country":""},{"id":60257,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arjay Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":60258,"logo_path":null,"name":"Funky Pretty Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":29602,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hungry Eye Lowland Pictures B.V.","origin_country":""},{"id":60259,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pavlov's Condo Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Mating season is about to get grizzly.","title":"Bear with Us","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2}
