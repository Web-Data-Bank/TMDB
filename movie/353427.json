Their post-bop music is generally funky (although \"Freefall\" is an uptempo cooker) and sometimes a bit bombastic yet is never predictable. Trumpeter Randy Brecker and tenor saxophonist Michael Brecker take many fiery solos while also sounding warm on ballads. They are supported by a particularly strong rhythm section. In addition, the WDR Big Band contributes 14 horns and a guitar to accompany the core group.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Brecker Brothers - Some Skunk Funk (Live at Leverkusener Jazztage 2003)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
