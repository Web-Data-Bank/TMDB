As a consequence, his relationship with a young boy no longer satisfies him. Both he and she lose sight of the meaning of life, because of their own inability to see others and to see love, as perception relies on proximity instead of distance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/a3gHzXqouZfnuOlIU30Z9l0DGkA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3451,"logo_path":"/53lT8VOQ9JDiPGYLvjgO42Av58I.png","name":"Art Pictures Studio","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":5630,"logo_path":"/s0mHCw53fp6EAapR7g0dwYbz0l5.png","name":"Non-Stop Productions","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":17962,"logo_path":null,"name":"Slovo","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":106205,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Studio \"Slovo\"","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2003-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black Ice","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":2}
