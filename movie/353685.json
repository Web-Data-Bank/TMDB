Even while as a student, the main ambition of Vivek is to get married as soon as he is back home after his studies. Vivek has a circle of very close friends of four, with whom he discusses everything.  A phone-in programme encounter with Kavya aka Tinku (Bhama), a radio jockey, and Vivek, results in loss of Kavya's job.
