Huck is a resourceful and spirited lad who knows how to survive on his own. He flees his father, and travels with Jim (a runaway boy). He learns much about life from Jim.  Tom Sawyer is a mischevieous adventure hungry boy who has a zest for life. He's a true romantic at heart, but not above a little trickery to get his own way, or to get out of work.  Tom's life really starts to become complicated when he meets Huck. Together with Jim, they begin a series of adventures.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uNay4L4zpKrQySjaj7qKFrMSPH1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":45723,"logo_path":"/4kkwgMhlfhxb9HigINcHFcT49Ny.png","name":"Enoki Films","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":54157,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aubec","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Huck and Tom's Mississippi Adventure","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":2}
