'Better Off Without You', 'On Saturday', 'Let It Go', 'Boys Lie', 'Born Too Late', 'Penny on the Floor', and of course, 'Cigarette', are the kind of songs you find yourself humming for days. With indelible melodies, confident riffs and thoughtful lyrics that connect with listeners, they withstand the test of time. And get better with age. Just like the band that created them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":60646,"logo_path":null,"name":"High Wire Music","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Clarks: Still Live","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
