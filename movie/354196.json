Lucier explains and comments on his œuvre – from his early live electronics performances (MUSIC FOR SOLO PERFORMER,1965 and BIRD AND PERSON DYNING, 1975) up to the premiere of his ensemble piece PANORAMA 2 in 2011. One of Lucier’s key works, I AM SITTING IN A ROOM (1969), is introduced as a central structuring device in the film.  At home in Middletown, Connecticut, Lucier offers rare insights into the beginnings of his pioneering works, his time as a member of the Sonic Arts Union, his relations with John Cage and David Tudor, as well as his teaching practice at Wesleyan University.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/x6EShxSOFp3XlCIEqOXUjeLKPoC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2406,"logo_path":"/awYxP0L1FKUxf0oIanEDEKFKuaY.png","name":"FilmFörderung Hamburg","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":192245,"logo_path":null,"name":"Viola Rusche \u0026 Hauke Harder","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2012-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Composer Alvin Lucier","title":"No Ideas But in Things - the composer Alvin Lucier","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
