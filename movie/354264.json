Highly stroboscopic and hallucinatory, these kinetic performances result in otherworldly spaces and plays of near-abstraction and suggestive imagery. Mountaineer Spinning features an evocative musical score. This work highlights Jacobs' relentless experimentation with the very fabric of projected light.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mountaineer Spinning","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
