Any further evidence of the title’s confusing ‘awfulness’ – other than the literal disentanglement of the line remains, however, tentative, left as it were, literally, at a loose end. The viewer knows nothing of the incident that led to this backlash or entanglement; nor of the directors’ initial motive for the title indeed not of any other attempt at blending an additional storyline beyond what is seen. There is, perhaps, one link with a reverse reaction – a sense of gradual recovery taking place, as the thread unfolds from a position of multiplicity back to a singular line.” (Pamela Kember, Rethinking Refunctioning, ‘Awful Backlash’ catalogue, May 2000)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aegGn8pEoUM5lSYcwUmaZgXmWJd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1967-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Awful Backlash","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
