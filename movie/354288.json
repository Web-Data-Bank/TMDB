A renowned embalmer was commissioned by the grieving Juan Per칩n to preserve her body for display, and Argentines flocked to be near \"Evita\". Three years later, when his government was overthrown by a military coup, Per칩n fled the country before he could make arrangements for the transportation of his wife's body. The military junta now in control kidnapped the corpse; so afraid were they of Eva's symbolic power that they even made it illegal to utter her name.","popularity":2.575,"poster_path":"/BcRdH1O7Y6ic25SxvLt2DLmUn0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3883,"logo_path":null,"name":"JBA Production","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":5623,"logo_path":null,"name":"Haddock Films","origin_country":"AR"},{"id":7680,"logo_path":"/uGcInOaHyvFZ337T5OeQKKVjSCJ.png","name":"Tornasol Films","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":17121,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tita Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2015-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa침ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eva Doesn't Sleep","video":false,"vote_average":4.9,"vote_count":32}
