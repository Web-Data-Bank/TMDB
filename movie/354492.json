At once idealized and grotesque, the disintegrating images become an integral reflection of the title's double entendre of hide as both an organic surface that inherently decays with time, and the deliberate act of concealing its irreversible plasticity","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vnoiHuvllMEzRHyyrgGZ39fPY9k.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hide","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
