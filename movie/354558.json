Its subject matter was contemporary, rather than being a historical piece or an action drama set among the partisans of World War II. In the story, a dockworker sees that a crane, a crucial piece of shipyard equipment, is being endangered by a violent storm, and despite considerable danger to himself works to save it. ~ Clarke Fountain, Rovi","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8OOrofjuI2xN2tgccutmis6aR22.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29695,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shqipëria e Re","origin_country":"AL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AL","name":"Albania"}],"release_date":"1968-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Albanian","iso_639_1":"sq","name":"shqip"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Broad Horizons","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
