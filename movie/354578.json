The surviving print, although incomplete, offers an essential glimpse into Uchida’s prewar period, when he was associated more with realist dramas than with the period films that dominated his work after the war.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zRF0IgKoeVxzak4F2mAIrR6kj5m.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":955,"logo_path":"/5xnXD3PJI1HqOJceSAKZ3fDqO1V.png","name":"Nikkatsu Corporation","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1937-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unending Advance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
