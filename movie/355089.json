Cast as a troubleshooter for the U.S. Land Office, Dean is assigned to settle a deadly range war. Sure enough, the warring homesteaders and cattlemen are being whipped into a frenzy by a third party, who hopes to \"divide and conquer,\" claiming the land for himself. Surprisingly, all-purpose PRC villain George Cheseboro isn't the culprit in this one; instead, he's cast as the father of heroine Jennifer Holt. Roscoe Ates is once more on hand for some questionable comedy relief.","popularity":0.879,"poster_path":"/oC7uS3bnbZCWWONhxUm8RyzbZnn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16466,"logo_path":null,"name":"PRC","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1948-02-21","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"COVERED WAGON TRAINS BATTLE OUTLAWS!","title":"Tornado Range","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
