Mistaken for a notorious gunslinger, Jim is appointed deputy sheriff of a wide-open cattle town. Playing along, our hero gets down to business -- and by the time his true identity is revealed, it hardly matters, since most of the bad guys are pushing up daisies on boot hill. Beverly Garland turns in another exceptional performance as the heroine, while Morris Ankrum, Roy Barcroft and I. Stanford Jolley fulfill their usual responsibilities. Two Guns and a Badge is of historical interest as the very last \"B\"-grade \"series\" western ever produced in Hollywood.","popularity":0.665,"poster_path":"/8bptzuYfLDXy6kFLyB4s0k5bLtw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4928,"logo_path":null,"name":"Allied Artists Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":36986,"logo_path":null,"name":"Silvermine Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1954-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A LAWMAN'S GUNS!...A KILLER'S REPUTATION!","title":"Two Guns and a Badge","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
