But a survivor, Arikawa, has planned to rebuild the school by using Chiaki, the former Number 66, who’s a daughter of the principal. His first objective is to kidnap a good female teacher to brainwash her into becoming the school’s star trainer. When Arikawa kidnaps his targeted high school teacher, Mitsuko Sawamura, Chiaki thoroughly humiliates her into a corner in confinement. When Mitsuko finally loses herself, her brainwashing is successfully completed – or so it seems.","popularity":2.013,"poster_path":"/ys7fd8bM2TqXg1p7DAuY2YeGckC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2012-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Missing 66","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":3}
