Now alone and without work, just as it seems that things could not possibly get worse, parts of Mamoru's bicycle begin to disappear, one by one. In frustration, Mamoru leaves a note for the thief, begging him to just take the whole thing. The note left in response is signed God, leaving Mamoru only more confused. At last, when the only remaining piece of the bicycle is a lonely bell, Mamoru receives an envelope, containing addresses at which each piece of the bicycle might be retrieved.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":61261,"logo_path":"/tmpDbOlLbyBz2JkeQUR1XtTAYxm.png","name":"Biola University","origin_country":"US"},{"id":61262,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio RE:","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2009-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A bicycle dismantled... a life retrieved.","title":"Bicycle","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":2}
