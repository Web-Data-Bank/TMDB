It remained unfinished due to the death of Sergei Parajanov. The Confession (1990) was his favorite screenplay, which was written in the 1960s and was his film-memory of the childhood, student years, marriage, imprisonment and more as the fantasist Parajanov perceived it. Parajanov gifted the screenplay to Mikhail Vartanov, made a drawing on the cover and wrote: \"The Confession will only be made by a director born in 1924 in Tiflis, Georgia.\" He predicted that he would not finish it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":116561,"logo_path":"/fem7nge6VHqJL01hFQU64UlryrY.png","name":"Armenia Studio","origin_country":"AM"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AM","name":"Armenia"},{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1990-07-20","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Confession","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":3}
