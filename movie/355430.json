Secrets, half-truths, and mistrust prevail in the state security office of chief inspector Varga, who makes professional privilege a cover for his unprofessional interest in a boldly carnal refugee and her alleged brother. Director/writer Saboga (screenwriter for Raúl Ruiz’s MYSTERIES OF LISBON) saturates the dark world of this predatory tale with steamy eroticism and paranoia, starting with the incestuous desires of his bi-curious adolescent daughter and including the family maid.","popularity":1.002,"poster_path":"/91ERFI7lhjpJLsNYezFXQUROWeW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":44106,"logo_path":"/v4Wwng5Bgmp5HqgYIJXJLpChS7k.png","name":"Leopardo Filmes","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2015-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"At an Uncertain Time","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":2}
