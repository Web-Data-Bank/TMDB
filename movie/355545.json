In that time he has offered only glimpses into his creative process. Creative Domain is a rare in-depth documentation of how he creates a single dance. Through the lens of award-winning cinematographer Tom Hurwitz, we see Paul’s non-verbal communication with his dancers. Below the surface of this dance and the many works that came before, is Paul’s power of acute observation, revealing a side to his choreography that is strangely prophetic. The dominant voice is Paul’s, between the guarded and unguarded moments we see him with new eyes and new understanding.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/z5STprbbYBtV2ikDcCrq4lQdweV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The master reveals his craft.","title":"Paul Taylor Creative Domain","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
