More bootleg than traditional special, Andy recorded only one show, one night at The Virgil in Los Angeles. The special features a bouncy mix of Andy's dive-in-head-first approach to comedy. With The Virgil's intimate space as a backdrop, Andy litters the show with playful self-deprecating bits, a healthy dose of \"screaming at strangers\" and a nonstop stream of riffs.","popularity":1.131,"poster_path":"/lMRzqjuyqV6ak6xnfy81u8xn8HR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21206,"logo_path":null,"name":"New Wave Entertainment Television","origin_country":"US"},{"id":61661,"logo_path":null,"name":"CleftClips","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Andy Peters: Exclamation Mark Question Point","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
