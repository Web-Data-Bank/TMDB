All the characters in this film have no existence outside the imagination of the author and are inspired by the Balkan way of living. This is a story about the illusions of the Don Quixotes of the Balkans and their life style. Georgij is one of these. He is young, enthusiastic, well-mannered and a charming and committed teacher with an invincible spirit who wants to bring all innovations from the New World, which is Europe, to the Balkans. He opposes traditional Balkan skepticism and does not accept the status quo.","popularity":1.341,"poster_path":"/40G5FBXRl0nc1VPLgtIlMBiPIwc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129112,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stage","origin_country":"MK"},{"id":65034,"logo_path":null,"name":"Makedonska Televizija","origin_country":"MK"},{"id":129113,"logo_path":null,"name":"MS Production","origin_country":"MK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","name":"Macedonia"}],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Macedonian","iso_639_1":"mk","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inn on the Road to Europe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
