Director James Crump has meticulously constructed Troublemakers from interviews (with Germano Celant, Virginia Dwan, and others), photos and footage of Walter De Maria, Michael Heizer, Robert Smithson, Nancy Holt, and Charles Ross among others at work on their astonishing creations.","popularity":1.711,"poster_path":"/4PAfIpzBasTLWCEwn9LKzHBgMcz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4095,"logo_path":"/zR0M1hMBNRKyYnRHMidK9WjUsUX.png","name":"First Run Features","origin_country":"US"},{"id":96537,"logo_path":null,"name":"Summitridge Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Troublemakers: The Story of Land Art","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":8}
