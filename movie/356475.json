In 1943, a 24-year-old maths student and a GPO engineer combined to hack into Hitler's personal super-code machine - not Enigma but an even tougher system, which he called his 'secrets writer'. Their break turned the Battle of Kursk, powered the D-day landings and orchestrated the end of the conflict in Europe. But it was also to be used during the Cold War - which meant both men's achievements were hushed up and never officially recognized.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/eDFpppyR1XAuciDNGNtDJu47Xxd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4762,"logo_path":"/igWZmjr5Zhbnxf7DinSOLoiggLU.png","name":"BBC Wales","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2011-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Code-Breakers: Bletchley Parks Lost Heroes","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
