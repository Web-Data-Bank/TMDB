Current marketing of hormonal birth control (Depo-Provera, Seasonale, Seasonique, Lybrel, Anya) attracts customers by promising freedom from monthly periods. For many consumers, menstrual suppression eliminates painful monthly flow, giving them more control in their lives. For others, menstrual suppression represents a frightening shift in thinking about the human body and another dangerous experiment on womanâ€™s health. Period: The End of Menstruation? interrogates the cultural and medical side effects of suppression before 'the curse' disappears.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":61947,"logo_path":null,"name":"G6 Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"If you could stop your period, would you?","title":"Period: The End of Menstruation","video":true,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
