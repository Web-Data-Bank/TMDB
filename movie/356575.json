While she works as a journalist in the cultural sector, he is an independent artist teaching at a local college. The unconventional yet well-liked pedagogue can get his students to enjoy almost anything, even nude drawing. Until one day the police turn up – and accuse him of sexual misconduct. Max and Eva are shocked when the allegation comes at them like a bolt out of the blue. Following several interviews, however, it soon becomes clear that the girl did spend a night at Max’s atelier the previous weekend. Sabine Boss’s TV drama shows how social and media instigation can back a teacher into a corner.","popularity":0.715,"poster_path":"/vwnkRvxat9vRbz1WFum8tMQLKCA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28950,"logo_path":"/8RuUUKhPiJbICV03XO79IhSh8CH.png","name":"Dschoint Ventschr Filmproduktion","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":42145,"logo_path":"/fX8uY3tXWh814PLVqKM0IJEoDPW.png","name":"SRF","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2015-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Suspicion","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":4}
