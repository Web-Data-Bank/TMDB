It's an amazing spectacle of late 80's/early 90's indie-music icons. KMFDM's En Esch, Revco/Ministry's Chris Connelly, Nine Inch Nails creator Trent Reznor, Mary Biker, William Tucker (RIP), Raven (Prong/Killing Joke), Andrew Weiss (Rollins Band/Ween), Danny Carey (Tool), and leader-slash-drummer Martin Atkins (Public Image Ltd./Ministry/Killing Joke) keep this video spinning with their over-the-top antics and Spinal Tap-ish tour foibles. This should be in your video collection between the Who's \"\"The Kid's Are Alright\"\" and Dave Markey's \"\"1991: The Year Punk Broke.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/598m6gygwzig5FUbQYWOpNNnjDa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pigface: Glitch","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
