They have two children, Teddy and Sandy, a lovely home, and a dog named Rex. What they know and how they live as a family is irreparably changed one day when it is discovered that a classmate of Teddy's is the apparent victim of sexual abuse and molestation at the respected neighborhood daycare center. Like all other parents, the Dollisons are tormented — \"we should have known, we should have seen\" — but their devastation is complete when Teddy tells his own story, one he promised his abusers he would never tell.","popularity":2.577,"poster_path":"/oxpfh5FSF2TdxEOKhOwdvAf2QzO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26307,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Avnet/Kerner Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1989-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Do You Know the Muffin Man?","video":false,"vote_average":6.333,"vote_count":3}
