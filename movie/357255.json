Her mother passed away some time ago, leaving a secret French toast family recipe behind as a symbol of her legacy. One day, Lise stumbles upon her mother s old diary and, to her astonishment, finds out that she has a sibling somewhere in France. Despite the fact that Theo, her father's right-hand winemaker, is about to propose, Lise travels to Paris to find the truth.  She meets a French chef, Jean-Pierre Baptiste, who's in need of a photographer for his new cookbook. Lise accepts the assignment, provided that he returns the favour by helping her track her long lost sibling. As they explore the city, Jean-Pierre s expressive personality slowly unravels Lise s reserved disposition. Her life starts transforming into a palette of new tastes, textures, colours and emotions.  Will Lise eventually find the truth that she hoped would set her free?","popularity":1.448,"poster_path":"/20DKdd1Kf1QjAO0ZpOJ9URtXPG2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42279,"logo_path":null,"name":"Times Media Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2015-08-03","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Afrikaans","iso_639_1":"af","name":"Afrikaans"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A journey to Paris to find the truth","title":"French Toast","video":false,"vote_average":5.667,"vote_count":3}
