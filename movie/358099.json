Singalingaland also happens to be an extension of Tim and Annieâ€™s game board, Wee Singdom. However, the main guest of honor (a singing rainbow) is missing, so as each character performs his or her respective performance, Chug-a-Long the engine and Cubby the caboose are sent to go look for her by asking a cirrus, stratus, cumulus cloud where she disappeared too. Eventually, she is found after Tim and Annie find her playing with their cat friend, Staccato, and as a reward, Chug-a-long and Cubby invited Annie and Tim and Staccato to attend the Wee Sing Festival, and Singing Rainbow is able to perform.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wvth5F9jf77mER9AXGXMtH7nYxF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113420,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wee Sing Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wee Sing: Wee Singdom The Land of Music and Fun","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
