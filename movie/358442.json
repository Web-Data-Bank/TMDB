A legacy of a history that is too heavy to bear, premeditated film, manipulation, and guilt. It's flashback, a crossroads of life and death, love and indifference, youth who feels lost, or one who believes he is found. It's a true story, a fragment of two lives that intersect at the threshold of adult life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rQ3H0sizLZIBOXi57bNreij9GcP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tabou","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
