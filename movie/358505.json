In all those years they loved and hated each other and went through several painful separations. Now, at the end of their lives, the two dancers are willing to open up about their love, their hatred, and their passion. In \"Our Last Tango\" Juan and María tell their story to a group of young tango dancers and choreographers from Buenos Aires, who transform the most beautiful, moving and dramatic moments of the  lives into incredible tango-choreographies.  These beautifully-shot performances compliment the soul-searching interviews and documentary moments of the film to make this an unforgettable journey into the heart of the tango.","popularity":2.141,"poster_path":"/lLu1CyT1w3KpQ4QqAtt2udwXVJc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32875,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lailaps Pictures","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2015-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Divided by life, united by Tango.","title":"Our Last Tango","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":22}
