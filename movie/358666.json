A roving camera and smooth theme music say more than words. London's traditional sights - Buckingham Palace, Trafalgar Square, the Royal Parks, the Zoo, etc., await their visitors in the early morning. While a young motor-cyclist hurries by, to work on the pleasure boat he conducts along the Thames; a Beefeater goes on duty at the Tower; and the visitors hurry into London by bus and coach. The film conjures up the mood of a variety of London scenes and events throughout the day until a sightseeing-bus tour gives the visitor a last chance to catch up by night on anything he may have missed during the day.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1962-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"London for a Day","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
