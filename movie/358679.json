This time, Gene tries to reform Randy Pryor, a would-be juvenile delinquent, played by Autry-protégé Dick Jones (who later starred in the Autry-produced TV series Range Rider and Buffalo Bill Jr). To this end, Pryor is enrolled at the New Mexico Military Institute, where much of this film was lensed. The kid chafes at the school's regimen and escapes, heading back to his criminal mentor Pat Feeney (Robert Armstrong).","popularity":1.121,"poster_path":"/nt3jvze0tWje25IOHyh5iEAgWc7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":10569,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gene Autry Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1949-12-20","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"GENE AND CHAMPION RIDE WITH THE CAVALRY CADETS to blast a gambler's frame-up inside a killer's trap!","title":"Sons of New Mexico","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
