The images which today determine the day of the city are operative images, control images. Representations of traffic regulation, by car, train or metro, representations determining the height at which mobile phone network transmitters are fixed, and where the holes in the networks are. Images from thermo-cameras to discover heat loss from buildings. And digital models of the city, portrayed with fewer shapes of buildings or roofs than were used in the 19th century when planned industrial cities arose, amongst them the Lille agglomeration. Despite their boulevards, promenades, market places, arcades and churches, these cities are already machines for living and working. I too want to \"remake\" the city films, but with different images. Limited time and means themselves demand concentration on just a few, archetypal chapters. Fragments, or preliminary studies.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mblHcGQHj0hRZcAjSLr44yG2dia.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Counter-Music","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
