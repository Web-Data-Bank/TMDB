During their months on the road, a baby is born, they meet fellow travellers, and their resolve is put to the test by harsh snowstorms and physical fatigue. But no hardship can deter them from their ultimate goal — not even the threat of death, a very real danger in this high altitude where a common cold can take one's life.","popularity":2.526,"poster_path":"/j6bBNDVn8EpqP2BxEPz3DVjvKum.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97384,"logo_path":null,"name":"He Li Chen Guang International Culture Media Co","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2015-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tibetan","iso_639_1":"bo","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Journey Into Humanity And Faith.","title":"Paths of the Soul","video":false,"vote_average":6.659,"vote_count":22}
