But then along came John du Pont, an eccentric heir to the family fortune with a passion for wrestling.  His 800-acre Foxcatcher Farm outside Philadelphia became the hub of the sport, with state-of-the-art training facilities, free accommodations, generous stipends and the support of America’s best freestyle wrestlers, brothers Mark and Dave Schultz.  It all seemed too good to be true – and tragically it was, with a savage ending.  Featuring fresh testimonials and never-before-seen footage, “The Prince of Pennsylvania” is the story of a paradise lost to the madness of its creator, a man who had the means to buy anything except for the one thing he truly wanted.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hlVpnHsiQOXekM9DLIWIJlNjbEQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18595,"logo_path":"/2K8ko5VX6K2JTLmyctDpvH7Sgk9.png","name":"ESPN Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Prince of Pennsylvania","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":7}
