The Count (Jean-Claude Brialy) and his Countess Mahe (Sylvia Fennec) delight in throwing lavish costume balls. The couple develops a friendship with a young boy who delights in the parties thrown by the noble couple. Love soon blooms between the Countess and the boy as she searches for something more than a string of endless parties and social affairs. The masquerades are an attempt to freeze time and hold on to the nostalgia of a bygone era. For fear of losing her, the Count allows the Countess to continue her love affair.","popularity":0.68,"poster_path":"/mdilmf5PiaVxjfAOfEeWFN3SVZS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2260,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Marceau","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":512,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cocinor","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1970-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le Bal du comte d'Orgel","video":false,"vote_average":4.667,"vote_count":3}
