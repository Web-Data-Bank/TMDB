Behind the dykes is water and wilderness. Here, among these dykes on 1700 acres of fertile land, director Digna Sinke filmed from 1996 how Tiengemeten is intended to become a stretch of wild nature, as part of a conservation plan. This is easier said than done. Alternative land with living accommodations has to be provided for six farming families. This comes through for five, but not for Leen Vos. Sinke also filmed how project groups regularly come and take a look and call meetings. Tiengemeten will be divided into three sections: Wistfulness, Wilderness and Wealth. However, nobody knows how the plan will work out. The negotiators allow farmer Leen Vos to stay until 2007. Until that time, the project cannot be carried out. Sinke just keeps filming, in her restrained, observant style, devoted to the magnificent scenery.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":43565,"logo_path":"/hNAOu2cYkKP0S0BTKaGoKmp93om.png","name":"SNG Film (Studio Nieuwe Gronden)","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2001-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tiengemeten - Part 1","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
