These are often letters containing samples of their work for critique. One large envelope contains a letter. The letter-writer does not provide his name. The letter is a confession of crimes. The letter-writer has no family or friends, and claims to be \"ugly beyond description\". He is a chair maker and loves his work and all the chairs he creates, even going so far as to claim some sort of intangible connection to his work.","popularity":1.176,"poster_path":"/fIwcWXh8HTumBm940XWbtYXXr9U.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3560,"logo_path":"/yOsrKcVSpC9ofAkE6hJjvC8sW9u.png","name":"KSS","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1997-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Human Chair","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
