He never seems to have a good day. He has to smash in his rear window just to get out of his Volkswagen Beetle, having parked it too close between two other cars. He has to do all the dirty work in the office, while his spoiled rich kid colleague cooks the books for profit and shamelessly flirts with all his female co-workers. He’s attracted to his next-door neighbor who gets beaten and cheated upon by her boyfriend, but she doesn’t want to leave him. And he gets robbed at knife-point right outside his apartment building. Marcus manages to take the knife and chase away his attacker, but not before he gets stabbed in the shoulder. The incident awakens something dark in Marcus. He becomes a man with a mission, determined to set right all the injustice done to him. But ones the blood starts flowing, there’s no going back.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ckCPaYBOjdLk0jrFmXlR3yR8U2u.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74774,"logo_path":null,"name":"Infravermelho Filmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2015-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Uptake Fear","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":4}
