Inspired by the Church's use of filming techniques, and aided by ex-members of the organization, Theroux uses actors to replay some incidents people claim they experienced as members in an attempt to better understand the way it operates. In a bizarre twist, it becomes clear that the Church is also making a film about Louis Theroux.","popularity":7.148,"poster_path":"/mTAZFb79cum6bfU41C96DwMCp6Y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12840,"logo_path":null,"name":"Red Box Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":288,"logo_path":"/aW0IpM9d4Zjj978EqgDVSxXXhTj.png","name":"BBC Film","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What Hollywood didn't tell you about one of the world's most secretive religions","title":"My Scientology Movie","video":false,"vote_average":6.61,"vote_count":249}
