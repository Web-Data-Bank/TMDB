The Swiss, born in 1928, created more than thirty fonts, including the world-famous MÃ©ridien, Univers and Frutiger type families. Less well-known are his extraordingary freely conceived works. This film is a straightforward, sensitive portrait of the designer and his work which presents Adrian Frutiger's achievements and his relationship to nature in a new way.
