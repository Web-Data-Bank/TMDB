In doing so the three animators followed the footsteps of the 1950s Sannin no Kai composers (Yasushi Akutagawa, Ikuma Dan & Toshiro Mayuzumi) who banded together to stage performances of their avant-garde style of music. The Animation Group of Three showcased their work at three events: November 1960, December 1962, and April 1963. After 1964 this event expanded into a wider Animation Festival, that annually showcased the experimental fare of such artists as Taku Furukawa, Sadao Tsukioka, Goro Sugimoto, Keiichi Tanaami, and even Osamu Tezuka until 1971. Stamp Fantasy was introduced at the first Animation Group of Three screening on November 26, 1960 in the Sogetsu Art Center.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1961-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stamp Fantasia","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
