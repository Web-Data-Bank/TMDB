La Fura's concept is surprising and its originality demands our attention ... it gives rise to moments of great beauty and evocative power (El Pa√≠s).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10706,"logo_path":null,"name":"Unitel Classics","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gluck: Orfeo ed Euridice","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
