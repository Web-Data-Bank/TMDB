The Pirates and their rallying cry of “We Are Family” brought a renewed sense of pride to the city. But as it turned out, the family was dangerously dysfunctional, with many members succumbing to the temptation of cocaine and dragging baseball into a nationwide scandal. This film revisits that era and paints a picture of how, by 1985, easy drugs and fast nights brought the national pastime from the diamond to a federal courtroom.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/r3d4fcF1UmrPKQEx3JZld6RyDoq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18595,"logo_path":"/2K8ko5VX6K2JTLmyctDpvH7Sgk9.png","name":"ESPN Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Pittsburgh Drug Trials","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
