Constant fighting and car problems are just the beginning of their trouble, as they will soon discover that they are not alone on this road.  Two sisters, a duo of criminals and something much worse wait for them.  Their situation quickly turns from a move to trying to survive the horrors of THE HARVESTMAN.  Shot on location in Hays, Alberta with a budget that gives a whole new meaning to no-budget filmmaking.  The Harvestman was created by a group of people who share a love of movies.  With the help and support of a dedicated group of volunteers they crafted a homage to the grindhouse films of the 60s and 70s.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2012-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"6 People, 1 Wrong Turn","title":"The Harvestman","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
