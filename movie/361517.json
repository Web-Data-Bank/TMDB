His real interest is writing a kung-fu comic book which he has titled I'm a Public Official, featuring a crime-fighting bureaucrat and his two nerdy friends (based on himself and his slacker friends Min-gu and Park). Gil-ho then meets Kim Jung-sook, when he tags along to a meeting where she berates Min-gu into taking responsibility for her pregnant best friend Seung-hee. Gil-ho and Jung-sook realize that they knew each other years ago in college, when she was geeky and similarly hot-tempered and Gil-ho couldn't stand her. After unexpectedly sleeping together after a party, the two begin dating and eventually move in together, with Jung-sook having a regular job as a manager at a water-purifying company. Gil-ho gets an offer from a comic book publisher, but his lack of ambition and inability to commit to anything start to take their toll on their relationship.","popularity":1.375,"poster_path":"/7gYp6NqI12x18NOFlbspY8rxJuc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70681,"logo_path":null,"name":"TPS Company","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":116325,"logo_path":null,"name":"Only One Movie","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":60901,"logo_path":null,"name":"Invent Stone","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2015-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sunshine Love","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
