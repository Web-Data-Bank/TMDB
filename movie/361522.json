A truant from the rough streets of Harlem, Althea emerged as a most unlikely queen of the highly segregated tennis world in the 1950s. Her roots as a sharecropper’s daughter, her family’s migration north to Harlem in the 1930s, mentoring from Sugar Ray Robinson, David Dinkins and others, and fame that thrust her unwillingly into the glare of the early Civil Rights movement, all bring her story into a much broader realm of the American story.","popularity":0.753,"poster_path":"/zwy97UMtVmaV3TlDhIzPxXp5I5H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76975,"logo_path":null,"name":"Icarus Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A documentary film about the trailblazing athlete, Althea Gibson","title":"Althea","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":3}
