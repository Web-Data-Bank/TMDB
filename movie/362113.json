Among other things, Deni told me the story of the foundation of the house, during the slavery period. Among the slaves, there was a priestess from Dahomey, where she used to be a queen, and worshiped African voodoos. Lacking authorization to practice their worship, the slaves hid in a shed, which has become over the years the House of Minas.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":53768,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tambor Multiartes","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":52686,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tu i Tam Filmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2015-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Vodunsi","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
