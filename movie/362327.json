But in an age where any destination is in the palm of your hand- just a click away, what is left to truly explore?  Level 1 examines the universal dialect of moving down snow on two feet through a lens of fresh perspective- documenting the outer niches of a sport pushed under the rug by the modern day ski zeitgeist.  From the secret valleys of Switzerland, the ancient cities of Estonia, to the rowdy rope-tows of Minnesota- follow us around the globe as we capture skiing in its purest form. It’s a Small World, after all.","popularity":1.102,"poster_path":"/raLJdgYQegLPEHMlfXftx4HlXhS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11108,"logo_path":"/7Jtc9MZ45zdqoSoE9jgvuSLjgEL.png","name":"Level 1 Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Small World","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
