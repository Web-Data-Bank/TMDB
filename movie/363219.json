Based on the historical events of the time of the French Revolution, this story of a community of Carmelite nuns who go to the guillotine rather than renounce their calling can be received in many ways.  Poulenc's warmly melodic and lyrical score is wholly dramatic and gripping, and Dame Joan Sutherland, recreating the role she sang at the opera's British premiere in 1958, sings the second prioress with commanding moderation. This production serves the inspiration of Poulenc in every important particular of style, economy and theatrical force. Richard Bonynge conducts the Elizabethan Sydney Orchestra. Sung in English.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":159,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dialogues of the Carmelites","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
