This is all from a film by Jean-Marie Straub – about fate, the soul and the cosmos, about the evident nature in which man lives, just like in the aquarium surrounding him. And finally, there’s the nation as a symbol for the community of free people. A Straub film represents a gift that isn’t based on exchange, but rather the opposite of communication. And what could be more beautiful and liberating in life?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jKJO4WHR3CYpy9CQyFWjvJlymmo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73467,"logo_path":"/2ShpO35d9Sja9UzdEzDtBk7DaQf.png","name":"Andolfi","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":98752,"logo_path":null,"name":"Belva Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2015-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L’Aquarium et la Nation","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
