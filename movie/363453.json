The artist addresses the fallibility of electronic transmission by emphasizing the distortion and absurdities that occur as a result of technical interference. Stressing the fact that there's never a straight story, Rosler asserts her presence in a character-genererated text that irolls over the manipulated images, isolating excerpts from her sources. In Rosler's barrage of media information, the formal structure is inseparable from her political analysis.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"If it's too bad to be true, it could be DISINFORMATION","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
