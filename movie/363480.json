Riley is scraping bottom when she miraculously lands a job with a wealthy New York City entrepreneur. He’s a bad-boy socialite type who is poised to play Scrooge by closing one of his factories just before Christmas, which would devastate an entire town. It’s left to Riley to talk him out of it and turn him into a man of virtue rather than shame.","popularity":4.988,"poster_path":"/2rJOyucwo6M8is8rtimmt4RNS6e.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Christmas Incorporated","video":false,"vote_average":6.466,"vote_count":73}
