As in his other films (Very Nice, Very Nice; 21-87), Fluxes has a disconnected flow of images that, in their erratic way, build up into a cutting indictment of the world the way it is. The film's only commentary consists of unrelated snatches of words and sounds.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qHa8zBip58p2kgScTMceoX0Aopd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1968-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fluxes","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
