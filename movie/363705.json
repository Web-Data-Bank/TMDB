Using a system derived from techniques developed by the British architect and theorist Colin Rowe, Matta-Clark first divided the exterior wall of the house into nine equal grid-like sections. He then removed eight segments from the structure piece by piece, leaving the middle section of the grid intact. Bingo was filmed and edited primarily by Matta-Clark.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bingo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
