He then rewound the film, repositioned the mattes, and reshot the same camera load. Using only in-camera  editing,  the  light  appears  to  slice  through the film frame in a manner analogous to Matta-Clark’s architectural “cuttings.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"City Slivers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
