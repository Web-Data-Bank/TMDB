For almost thirty years, he has been there, always in the same entrance to a building, with the same friends. It's boredom, unemployment. Dreams are extinguished. However, around them, it circulates, it lives. It also succeeds. Women, they work and pass without even seeing them. And there are more and more strollers. Dozens of strollers. Even the younger generation is already parents. What if that was \"the solution\", the way out of a universe without a future? No one takes Mohamed seriously. And yet! By opening, against the general opinion, a \"wild\" nursery, by offering working women to keep their babies, Mohamed and his friends will offer themselves a future, a job, respect for all ... and who knows , maybe, love!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ScV7ZjAT1SdaNWEMC3qn9v7g5V.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/eLvjHPYZ12GR58lrDgg6MXZp2a3.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":3630,"logo_path":null,"name":"Merlin Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2014-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Crèche des hommes","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":1}
