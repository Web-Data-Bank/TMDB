Called KV 63 - it is the 63rd discovered since the valley was first mapped - the new, intact tomb was found just 16 feet away from King Tut's resting place. A team of archeologists led by Otto Schaden discovered the tomb by accident while conducting \"routine digs\" on the nearby tomb of King Amenmesses, a 19th Dynasty pharaoh.
