While based relatively closely on historical characters and events, the opera’s central scene is fictional: the highly emotional meeting of the queens that concludes the first act (originally invented by Schiller) never took place. It’s a dramatic device that brilliantly highlights the two women’s contrasting characters.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":153,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maria Stuarda","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
