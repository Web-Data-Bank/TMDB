It is not a comedy though the characters often say funny things. It is not a detective story even though the hero is trying to solve a murder. It is not a nature drama though it shows the splendid colours and customs of the countryside. It is not a musical though Lubica expresses her longing in a passionate dance. Nor is it a film about ghosts though a ghost does ask the hero for a favour. A few draughts of Strawberry Wine are enough to take us into a magical world in the true centre of Europe, where love, crime and penitence are just as much a part of life as the changing of the seasons, the migration of birds or the flowing of a mountain stream.","popularity":1.185,"poster_path":"/4cfS8ZdM8nbO3FB8zamidXZX4Dk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13869,"logo_path":"/aHvLljOgVACIvR7fjevOFmiC7g2.png","name":"Apple Film Production","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"},{"iso_3166_1":"SK","name":"Slovakia"}],"release_date":"2009-05-08","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Strawberry Wine","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":11}
