Her home tutor Mr. Marcus offers his young student guidance and wisdom, but he soon finds that Katie wants more than a mentor. Meanwhile, Mom Nica Noelle tells her daughter London that she's met a new man she plans to marry. But London soon discovers that Mom's new boyfriend is the older man London has been dating for months. Must she now call him \"Daddy?\" Nick Manning gets a little too close to his daughter's sexy, troubled friend April O'Neil with explosive results, and Derek Hay develops a \"lolitaesque\" obsession with exotic teen beauty Melanie Rios.
