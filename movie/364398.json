A cadet committing the same offense is acquitted and instead celebrated as a hero by the citizens, but flooding of guilt. A senior police officer on the other hand is going to be left by his wife in vain that claims more attention and time he has never failed to give her. The three destinies cross when the third of them takes hostage during the New Year, the new man in the woman.","popularity":0.62,"poster_path":"/jLR4oEIrT6sROuij3AWd8MG88sW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97724,"logo_path":null,"name":"Entertainment Power","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1996-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Log","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
