Julia has chosen to remain blind to the obvious signs that her current boyfriend is a two-timing cad, but her eyes are forced wide-open when she discovers that she is pregnant with his child. Diego is a party boy with daddy issues who can’t stay faithful to his sweet, dependable boyfriend. Micaela, meanwhile, is wasting her time chasing a bisexual actress who won’t even acknowledge their shared intimacy in private. As these three charismatic but troubled friends keep spinning their wheels, even their own chosen-family bonds get stress-tested to their breaking point.","popularity":1.147,"poster_path":"/vq7zjiOWFcQYmmgagUxQ042aF0n.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1768,"logo_path":null,"name":"Europa Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2016-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Restless Love","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":14}
