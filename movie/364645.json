It contains a history of the prelude to WW II, the death camps and other Nazi war crimes, and commentary on the character of the German people.  Directed by Frank Capra, this film is in essentially the same format as his \"Why We Fight\" series. It was intended to be shown to American troops participating in the invasion and occupation of Germany. But by the time it was ready, events had overtaken it -- Germany was already well on its way to falling -- so the film was shelved. Although it is readily available for public-domain viewing on the Internet, it has never been widely distributed or shown.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uN2tDlK4k4YmC2tPPkhZgmJSGBn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1945-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Here Is Germany","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":6}
