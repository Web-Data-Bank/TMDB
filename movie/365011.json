North-Europeans are forced to migrate. Lucas, a middle-class man gets stranded in a coastal village in search of a passage to a brighter elsewhere. Through the difficulties and dilemmas he faces, BRAK explores how far the end justifies the means and how the price we are prepared to pay, can turn a sacrifice into betrayal. This debut fiction film by documentary filmmaker Laurent Van Lancker mixes contemporary realities with predictions of a possible nearby future. BRAK is based on a novel by Elvis Peeters and filmed on location in real settings (refugee camps and the abandoned city of Doel, Belgium).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fallow","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
