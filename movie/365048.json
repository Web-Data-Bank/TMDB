He first emerged through his pioneering work in linguistics in the 1950s but later became a political activist and a critic of US foreign policy in Vietnam, its neo-liberal capitalism, and mainstream media.  Consisting primarily of interviews with Chomsky and other writers, academics, philosophers, social commentators and broadcasters, this film explores the breadth, originality and importance of his work; and the alternative narratives he has advanced at some of the most critical periods in recent history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":62165,"logo_path":"/9i15HMPXjW657H4BnrMkeQcbktL.png","name":"Al Jazeera","origin_country":"QA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Noam Chomsky: Knowledge and Power","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
