The first fiction film by award-winning documentarist Jaro Vojtek is an omnibus film about complicated relationships between parents and their children in which characters are challenged with long-term separation or declining health. Four stories titled Son, Marathon, Canary and Father tell four different tales that form a single view on the troubled relationship between parents and children. Each story takes place in a different season and together they create a multi-layered mosaic of relations  reflecting hopes, disappointments and inevitable decisions. With a documentary filmmaker’s precision, Vojtek observes the characters and their behaviour, presenting an authentic picture of damaged family relations.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jT5qeFrw4d0eIH7rtpG1Y65r0OS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92588,"logo_path":null,"name":"MPhilms","origin_country":"SK"},{"id":117020,"logo_path":null,"name":"Duracfilm","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":24023,"logo_path":"/yz6m1ty4qGvlkfReuqPZxdmD8V2.png","name":"RTVS","origin_country":"SK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SK","name":"Slovakia"},{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2014-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Children","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
