The alleged disease is caused by the relentless heat that hits the city. Under the marginal eyes of Guima, in a mix of reality and fantasy, the film presents a tropical/chaotic Salvador, as opposed to the stereotypical city seen in postcards, on a journey of a search for a redemptive air conditioning that can rid this contemporary antihero of what suffocates his existence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5W3KgEKQkVmzUYgIUfZNyqa20L9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114855,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cavalo do Cão Filmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2018-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tropykaos","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
