Each character calls attention to one aspect of the economy in a period of social tension: the three weeks before the start of the soccer World Cup. The director creates the movie by observing the daily life of the characters, without making interviews or commentaries. Future June aims to reflect on this historical moment and on the ways that the current economic model determines social and human relations.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rUPHqZwBDS0uKYYLdHImVVYFBUe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78864,"logo_path":null,"name":"Selfemade Films","origin_country":""},{"id":78865,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nofoco Filmes Produções Cinematográficas","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2015-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Future June","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":3}
