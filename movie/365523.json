The film begins in modern times, when a pair of Beethoven enthusiasts purchase the hair at a Sotheby's auction. The story then looks at the lock's previous owners and culminates in the science that reveals Beethoven's \"medical secret\". Set to a lush score of some of Beethoven's most glorious music, the film explores the world of forensic testing in sharp relief against the romance of 19th-century Vienna and the horrors of 20th-century Nazi Germany.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ft4AQnSmvjd2CH51U44KXC5uD5q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":164,"logo_path":"/v3zcUepvKC7Vz36yjklk1rw6k8Q.png","name":"Rhombus Media","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beethoven's Hair","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
