Requirement: they had to be one-minute artistic short films. The directors come from a whole range of different backgrounds, ranging from animated, experimental and short film to documentaries and feature films. The result is a multi-facetted sampler of diverse formal and contextual positions with regard to Mozart’s person and his influence on today’s society, art and culture.  The contributions run the gamut from experimental-conceptual statements through socio-critical and documentary observations to pithy short feature films.","popularity":0.622,"poster_path":"/k0ndfQY0xFQcArRhPXbv3Oqqkkm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":141637,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wiener Mozartjahr 2006","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2006-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mozart Minute","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
