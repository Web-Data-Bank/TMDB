It goes away when instead of playing football with other kids you sit down and silently contemplate the river. When your thoughts don’t let you sleep, and a lightning bug beats in a pot like a heart. When poems come into your mind and you feel you really need to sing. It goes away when you suddenly realize: this summer is going away and it is the last summer of your childhood.","popularity":0.874,"poster_path":"/dQtaAfQLhxlI0lqKyRqw82mAgw9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18157,"logo_path":null,"name":"Trikita Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2014-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Little Bird","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
