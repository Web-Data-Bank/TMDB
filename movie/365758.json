Surprises and challenges ensue, including drama with Alfreda's envious sister Mona Levi; the revelation of a deep, dark family secret involving Alfreda's former acquaintance Chivonne Price; and dealings with Leighton's super-loud, outspoken cousin Nelson Royal. Unfortunately, Leighton and Alfreda both play their roles too well as old wounds are re-opened and their carefully planned reunion leads to chaos - and a potentially real break-up.","popularity":1.771,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":66095,"logo_path":null,"name":"TV One","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Bless This Mess","title":"A Royal Family Holiday","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
