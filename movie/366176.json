It was once part of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy as the capital of the crown province of Bukowina. People of many different nationalities, languages, and cultures lived here together: Ukrainians, Romanians, Germans, Poles, Huzulians. Almost half of the population of Czernowitz, once amounting to 150,000 inhabitants, were Jews. The southern part of Bukowina is now part of Romania, the north, with Czernowitz/Chernivtsi, belongs to the Ukraine. Six years ago Volker Koepp made his film Herr Zwilling und Frau Zuckermann there. Dieses Jahr in Czernowitz returns there with emigrants and their descendants.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5LWA0Zkudf11DMvkXflUV2EXCj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2004-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"},{"english_name":"Yiddish","iso_639_1":"yi","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This Year in Czernowitz","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
