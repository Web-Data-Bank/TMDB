Built in the 1920s as  a holiday home for Welsh coalminers' sons, boasting a pool, sports yards and even a chapel of its own. Not much remains of its former glory, though. Shattered glass and debris are all over the place; graffiti on the walls. There are countless trap falls and opportunities for injury. A parent's nightmare, it can be heaven on earth for a certain kind of child. It more or less is for Kevin. He has been eleven years old for quite some time now. Has it been years or decades?","popularity":0.615,"poster_path":"/bmPDnu7LOo73WzyPp6PBKKn6DGm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":65202,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Festivals Company","origin_country":""},{"id":41001,"logo_path":null,"name":"Schattenkante","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2011-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boys Village","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":9}
