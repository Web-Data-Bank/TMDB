Years later, Joseph Smith helped provide spiritual tools necessary for his life ahead. Brigham rose above the turmoil of Joseph's martyrdom to lead the Saints to the safety of the West. As the second prophet of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, he moved populations, formed armies, built cities and temples, and nurtured the growth of the Church. Enduring to the end, Brigham truly was the \"Lion of the Lord\" and was greeted again by the Prophet Joseph Smith, as he passed through the veil.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/v1sY3IydUYdXFPd0VnvPCFPof68.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":66939,"logo_path":null,"name":"Trek West, Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brigham Young: The Modern Prophets","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
