In July 1941, the village was the site of an unimaginable atrocity. Seventy-three years later, few speak honestly or completely about what happened. ABSENT is a cinematic portrait of the ghost village of Marculesti, its current inhabitants, and their very complex relationship to their own history. Filmed entirely on location, the film documents one of Europe's poorest, most remote, and least-visited places.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pvOkuRehf4XPOnOeEqy9PZfOFip.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":67142,"logo_path":null,"name":"Willona Prod","origin_country":""},{"id":67143,"logo_path":null,"name":"Iconoclastic Features","origin_country":""},{"id":67144,"logo_path":null,"name":"Western Transylvania Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2015-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Absent","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
