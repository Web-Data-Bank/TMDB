His cousin Anijs, pharmacist in the Northern provinces of the Netherlands, has gotten into a fix after illegal medical practices, and is looking for a way out. For himself and his wife Martha, but also for a colony of poor peat cutters whom he promises a future in the United States. Committed - or is it pride? - the two of them think up a scheme from which they all will fully benefit. With tragic consequences.","popularity":4.329,"poster_path":"/4FL35Rg3MteJMP2eTzonI1T7GcI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24845,"logo_path":"/eRT3fMGdAaQaFyOYXMEIt8GCe6I.png","name":"Topkapi Films","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":6266,"logo_path":"/cKEYr7wwstX4p6PrelqNuEvmgXA.png","name":"Mythberg Films","origin_country":"HU"},{"id":8659,"logo_path":"/96hCWEsfmTZQsoUap0CcG21qaA.png","name":"VPRO","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":4232,"logo_path":"/5uY5oqgSEUvzfmn8xC4eqGVU0s5.png","name":"Menuet","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2015-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Noble Intention","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":36}
