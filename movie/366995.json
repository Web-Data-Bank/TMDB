Visiting the celebrations of the Virgin Mary's (Marias) from Brasil, Cuba, México, Peru and Nicarágua, the director Joana Mariani observes the similarities and disparities among their cultures, and listen to women who have their very particular stories about life, faith and devotion. The result is a very singular film that shows that the image of the Virgin Mary (Maria) is a lot more than a religious figure or the mother of Christ.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/686Mza3X0MypycK56KyA3uMb0Qh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":62226,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitrine Filmes","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":33792,"logo_path":"/wN0HwkFPORlOmJUHv78iOqxhA90.png","name":"Primo Filmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2016-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marias: Faith in Womanhood","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4}
