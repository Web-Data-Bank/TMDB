Starring Kevin Rookstool, Kyle Redmond, Rory Sullivan, Mikey Horban, and Cory Graffunder. Directed by Wiley Watson.  Synopsis:  When the elevation gains and the mountains reveal themselves, the two wheeled man changes; with an increased heartbeat the mind begins to spin off the empty canvas ahead. Where the common man turns around, the adventurist seeks the path of the unknown trail, the perfect lip, and the unfolding challenge of earth’s vast terrain. It’s a feeling we all relate to, but most have forgotten. Sometimes the only way to remember is to Get Lost!  Supported by — Bolt Motorcycle Hardware, Kenda Tires, SRT, Seat Concepts, Dirtbike Magazine.
