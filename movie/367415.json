When they arrive in the region of Emilia-Romagna, Angelo strikes up a relationship with a wealthy marchesa connected to the fascist movement. Tonino, on the other hand, starts to follow the rebellious Giovanni, locked up for his anti-fascist stance, and the farmers who have joined in the anti-fascist forces. As the rebels are either murdered or put in prison, Tonino becomes more and more commited to their cause - especially after Giovanni is killed. When a silent movie on the condemned and dying Christ is shown on the brothers' screen, Tonino stops the action to project some slides he has taken that show who murdered Giovanni - in an action that calls for his brother and the rest of the bystanders to finally make a decision on where to place their loyalties.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ix6tEFqfR6nWTqP8Ef1nMrxtbPZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Magic Screen","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
