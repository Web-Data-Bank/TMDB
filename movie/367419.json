The film focuses on three New York dominatrices who willingly, lovingly, flog, smack, and abuse their clients: young perky Carrie, glitzy 30-something Sonja Blaze, and Teutonic matron Eva. All argue that they are providing society with an important, if quasi-sexual, service. Their clients ardently agree.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Whipped","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
