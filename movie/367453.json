Twenty years later, filmmaker Lucille Carra undertook a parallel trip inspired by Richie’s by-then-classic book, capturing images of hushed beauty and meeting people who still carried on the fading customs that Richie had observed. Interspersed with surprising detours—a visit to a Frank Sinatra–loving monk, a leper colony, an ersatz temple of plywood and plaster—and woven together by Richie’s narration as well as a score by celebrated composer Toru Takemitsu, The Inland Sea is an eye-opening voyage and a profound meditation on what it means to be a foreigner.","popularity":2.209,"poster_path":"/w9TeWIRxHJ1xI4skSc6XPNhCLVZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118414,"logo_path":null,"name":"Travelfilm Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Inland Sea","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":7}
