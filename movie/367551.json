In the process, he has failed at practically everything, most of all as a parent to his son. After a brush with death, Melvin decides to use his powers for good and clean up the streets of New Orleans with the help of his best friend/definitely-not-a-sidekick, Lucille. For a man who can do the impossible, it might be a fight even he canâ€™t win.","popularity":6.086,"poster_path":"/uYHb5CG90zHp5CDj3dJDP98c77q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20277,"logo_path":"/aomeUwZLIBjGXHfuZq7HTVk7UNb.png","name":"Protagonist Pictures","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":6353,"logo_path":"/7Fs0fMLWrPUaM3H0PK4hbnuEE1g.png","name":"Screen Media Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":10393,"logo_path":"/7MazD0kppT5OzdumzDi5IFYNthO.png","name":"Vertigo Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"From zero to superhero","title":"American Hero","video":false,"vote_average":5.672,"vote_count":206}
