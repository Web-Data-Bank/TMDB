As is typical of the Turhapuro series his family and friends become closely tied in with these events. His friends Härski Hartikainen and Sörsselssön return to the army for a refresher course and by chance Uuno's father-in-law, Councillor Tuura is made the Finnish Defence Minister. In one of the most memorable scenes, Uuno's wife, Elisabeth, dresses as Uuno and substitutes him for a day as Uuno has an apparently urgent meeting (at a restaurant) and while becoming lost in the woods with a malfunctioning radio, Tuura accidentally declares war on Sweden.","popularity":1.341,"poster_path":"/tLsT18nSTiCHLGiNc4LCWFad7rm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":59996,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmituotanto Spede Pasanen","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"1984-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Uuno Turhapuro armeijan leivissä","video":false,"vote_average":6.077,"vote_count":13}
