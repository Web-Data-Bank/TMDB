Her name is Ellen, a night club employee who just days before trying to end her life was drifting through each day uneventfully, spending most of her time at work and with her hard-partying boyfriend and lovable, yet incompetent roommates. But when Ellen meets Amy and Carrie, everything changes…all of their lives spin out of control thanks to one drug-fuelled night of partying and Amy’s overdose.
