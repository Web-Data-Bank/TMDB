Deliciously political, occasionally chilling, ironic and idiosyncratic, A Single Woman illuminates the role of the individual in the American legislative process with a whimsical amalgamation of storytelling, high-powered discourse and communion. The program is a filmed version of the successful stage play.","popularity":0.872,"poster_path":"/yYvS1WbEnhSItH52f6BfF5pg78b.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Discover America's Real First Lady","title":"A Single Woman","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
