Founded by Walter Perry, Emancipation Day was celebrated in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, every August 1 from 1932–1967 to mark the anniversary of British Parliment’s abolishment of slavery in 1834. Also known as The Greatest Freedom Show on Earth, the festival was large enough at one time to double the city’s population. As Emancipation Day became increasingly associated with the Freedom Movement across the border, the Windsor Police Department and city council began to push against the event, eventually culminating in its cancellation in reaction to the Detroit rebellion in 1967.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aoLXx2kgkfDJgXfnBXqppAhElyb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grand Finale","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
