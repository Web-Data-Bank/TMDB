Joseph Goldman (Fernando Rey) is a washed-up Hollywood actor making a living in the dinner-theater circuit. Accompanied by his wife Sarah (Carole Regnier), Goldman meets Frederique (Berangere Bonvoisin), who is hiding from her former lover. French financier Arthur (Fabrice Luchini) hopes to get into the film industry and bends the ear of a British director (Michael Medwin). The talkative film has little action, and none of the characters evoke much interest or resolve their dilemma.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pntIvQzJ2gv2z6CAiNeJsUeejRD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3453,"logo_path":null,"name":"Umbrella Films","origin_country":""},{"id":181,"logo_path":"/zhQ77XOviCBuXd74IurqqjgLNe0.png","name":"Channel Four Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":11359,"logo_path":"/aqWJRi66t2oMPMmC60CdK9I3WQd.png","name":"France 2","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":99599,"logo_path":null,"name":"London Cultural Trust Productions Ltd.","origin_country":""},{"id":16027,"logo_path":null,"name":"Portman Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1986-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paradise Hotel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
