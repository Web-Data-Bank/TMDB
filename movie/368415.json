Her drunken dad still stuck in his Santa suit from the local Christmas pagent, follows and soon comes in contact with the \"new dark ages\" of 1984. Juxtapositions of \"on-the street\" interviews (by Willie Boy Walker), punk performances by bands Flipper and The Mutants, TV shows of past-life hypnotism and nuclear destruction, and a crazed ex-con all finally intermix with the characters' own sagas.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/i6It3sxF6tKCGkvgprFoqgOF6Y4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94537,"logo_path":null,"name":"Target Video","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Emerald Cities","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":5}
