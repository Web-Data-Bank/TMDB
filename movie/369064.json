Marci and Blair are obsessing over being the perfect parents, Myra and Donald have retired and suddenly feel useless and Elizabeth is bending over backwards to get a promotion at work. Add to that Stephanie's blooming romance with Lawrence - who is torn between being with her and continuing his mission work - and Christmas seems to be taking a back seat. That is, until a group of kids at an orphanage helps the family to realize that there's more to Christmas than wrapping gifts and baking cookies.","popularity":2.282,"poster_path":"/czuESaYjLaKbo2309Er4ayMikmd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6728,"logo_path":"/2HMc1LNp5BoVSJtM2vHh5UuLXfw.png","name":"Swirl Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Baby for Christmas","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4}
