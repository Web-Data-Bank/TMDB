He learns what matters the most. The Lady neighbor that takes care of him tries to shelter him and protect him. Unsuccessfully. The Boy rides to fall. Death and suffering become more frequent, and more severe. When the Lady neighbor's teenage son is killed by a sniper as a collateral damage, she then rejects the Boy. The Boy escapes the siege, and shoots from a cannon at the city.Fifteen years later, the Boy - now twenty five - and the Lady neighbor meet again. They are united in pain and suffering.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bQMKBFBSMbhwRIq1NIqTny8RGAk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3252,"logo_path":null,"name":"Balkan Film","origin_country":"RS"},{"id":68798,"logo_path":"/spKomNMMIttJzenGsL7lrezQLIq.png","name":"Radio Televizija Republike Srpske","origin_country":"BA"},{"id":68799,"logo_path":null,"name":"Drina Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"},{"iso_3166_1":"BA","name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"}],"release_date":"2014-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":119,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"So Hot Was the Cannon","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":4}
