After endless parties, too many dead end jobs and family arguments, Bailey becomes Self-Destructive. Resorting to violence and severing all ties of friendship and love, Bailey enters a world where his friends are unable to follow. After a self-imposed exile Bailey returns to London to apologise, things have changed. Not everyone is sympathetic to his sudden re-appearance and there are others who will stop at nothing to make Bailey's life a living hell. Faced with a relationship lost amongst affluence and drug fueled parties, Bailey must accept his own limitations and confront the demons of his past.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vsolYqFT75Unlqz3HimrUx0h8ta.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127626,"logo_path":null,"name":"Porcelain Film","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Suffocate Your Dreams","title":"Breathe","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":1}
