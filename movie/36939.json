Art Spindle runs a high-end gallery: he hopes to flip a Mondrian for millions. One of his assistants, Beth, is sleeping with Art's most acquisitive client, Bob Macclestone. Beth wants Bob to set her up in her own gallery, so she helps him go behind Art's back for the Mondrian. Bob's wife, Jean, sets her eye on a young conceptual artist, Jo, who lusts after Art's newest assistant, Paige. Meanwhile, self-absorbed videographer Elaine is chewing her way through friends and lovers looking to make it: if she'll throw Dewey, her agent, under the bus, Beth may give her a show. And the Mondrian? No honor among thieves.","popularity":6.157,"poster_path":"/plnHFNGI1ToCFhyyYU3bb0AmDpl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":177061,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Works International","origin_country":""},{"id":22306,"logo_path":null,"name":"Constance Media","origin_country":""},{"id":109145,"logo_path":null,"name":"Firefly Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":15231,"logo_path":"/iFbzMtXFBv2ekA9Ldrw6LqjLrvX.png","name":"Muse Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":177062,"logo_path":null,"name":"P\u0026C Arcade Film Fund","origin_country":""},{"id":22309,"logo_path":null,"name":"Piccadilly Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":2326,"logo_path":null,"name":"Autonomous","origin_country":""},{"id":177063,"logo_path":null,"name":"Colourframe","origin_country":""},{"id":39829,"logo_path":null,"name":"S Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2009-06-17","revenue":47527,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Seduction.
