Lilithâ€™s betrayal by Adam in Eden and subsequent vow of revenge is recast as a modern tale with present-day Lilith (Cherie Wallace) musing on a life that has included giving up a baby for adoption and work as a bar dancer.  Interweaving mystical texts from Jewish folklore with interviews, music and poetry, Sachs reclaims this cabalistic parable to frame her own role as a mother.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/t0x8OSvz5wrbhfLey1fxFvRA9B5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Biography of Lilith","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
