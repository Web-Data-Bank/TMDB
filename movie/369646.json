Hokkaido. Edmonton. Revelstoke. Haines. Queenstown. Stubai Glacier. Many have passed through these places over the last two years; workers, travelers, adventurers…among them was a collection of friends bonded by a shared affinity for chasing snow to all corners of the globe. This group of skiers has come to be known as Legs of Steel, and they’ve been travel companions for a long time.  From their last two seasons of travel, through dedicated production comes a new film, Passenger.  A cinematic journey that spans four continents, the film aims to reveal the endless spectrum of emotions and experiences from each location. With the help of Old Man Winter himself, a story is woven through the twists and turns of a season, shedding light on how it feels to be a constant passenger.","popularity":0.846,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"ski freeski","title":"Legs of Steel PASSENGER","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
