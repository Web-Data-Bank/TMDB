His life exemplified the duty of all good Soviet citizens to become informers, at any expense. In our film, 75 years later, we call him little Janis. He is a Pioneer who lives on the Soviet collective farm “Dawn”. His father is an enemy of the farm (and the Soviet system) and plots against it. Little Janis betrays his father; his father takes revenge upon his son. Who then in this old Soviet tale is good and who is bad? This film reveals that a distorted brain is always dangerous. Even today.","popularity":0.806,"poster_path":"/8xKurU4B9TWhG2Xp0mdHZDMsYCC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":55586,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hargla Company","origin_country":"LV"},{"id":56475,"logo_path":"/esERw7L1N8H3Fh0WXC0W4zxgDJc.png","name":"Staron Film","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"},{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2015-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dawn","video":false,"vote_average":7.286,"vote_count":7}
