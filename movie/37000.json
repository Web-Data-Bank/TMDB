A family lives in an isolated house near a lake. Alexi, a young, pure-hearted man, is a woodcutter. Occasionally suffering from epileptic seizures and overcome by an ecstatic state, he is one with the nature around him. Alexi is very close to his younger sister, Hege. Their blind mother, father, and younger brother, silently observe this uncontrollable love.  One day a stranger arrives, a young man slightly older than Alexi.","popularity":1.373,"poster_path":"/oEuQ9ODrkNhmjkYIuPkkKNa8h6b.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":56575,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mandrake Films","origin_country":""},{"id":94,"logo_path":"/huC7HqorvUThGIrENrbcHmQVUA0.png","name":"ARTE France Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":107356,"logo_path":null,"name":"BlueLight","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":109756,"logo_path":"/sudlIoNIIrKmVWaYD2ZVo9HGogW.png","name":"Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2008-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Lake","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":28}
