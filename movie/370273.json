She cleans house and body, and calls on the spirits (Orishas in the Yoruba tradition), receiving much needed inspiration and assurance in a dream.  The film combines beautifully intimate still and moving images of the woman’s body and home space, along with playful stop-motion sequences.  —Jacqueline Stewart, UCLA Film and Television Archive","popularity":1.02,"poster_path":"/fR8wORQryUM63uWAC6hEMBONd8U.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10250,"logo_path":null,"name":"UCLA School of Film and Television","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cycles","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
