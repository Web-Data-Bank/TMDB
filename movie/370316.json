Y. loft buildings. A potted plant, fallen sheet of white paper, cat rests on the foreground door-ledge. The flow of the image is interrupted, partially and then wholly dissolving into blackness; the picture reemerges, the objects smear, somewhat double, edges break up... and again the serene image scintillatingly looms into view. Focus shifts abruptly between foreground and background planes, creating a strong volume-illusion. The fragile image then shines forth for one last time before dying out.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u884qNrgYtLzcmIWWKu0ZPnt6xy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1967-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Airshaft","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
