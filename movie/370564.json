It could have something to do with the lack of shopping days left on the calendar, but Howard is betting that his recent visit to a medical testing facility is more likely to blame. Before he can find out what he took and how to stop it, he'll need to go toe-to-toe, or fist-to-teeth, with every bloodlusting living thing between him and quiet spot to put a plan together.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Living Want Me Dead","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
