The Gospel… also promotes Derek Jarman’s importance as one of Britain's finest film-makers and acts, therefore, as a rally call to all would-be independent film-makers. This is the ’10 commandments of St. Derek ‘(who was indeed canonised by the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence) on low-budget film-making.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yVsdFRHFHjFT5bSY2nzEsRjdw15.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":105925,"logo_path":"/dYmtuHd9M4lJ1ZE8kyFfvKPzNG7.png","name":"400 Blows Production","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Gospel According to St Derek","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
