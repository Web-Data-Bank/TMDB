The eye is like a keyhole with a view to the subjects interior, to the complex and abysmal activities of the psyche. Schwere Augen does not intend to deliver an analytic expose, but rather attempts an aesthetic approach to the distant scopic sense. A declaration of love to the pleasure of looking - a small, romantic movie.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Schwere Augen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
