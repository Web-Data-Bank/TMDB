Its source is an early-20th-century shadowgraph toy, which used “paper print films\" in the form of sequential silhouette drawings that were brought to life as they passed before a stroboscopic screen. Gehr’s silent, digital video adaptation transforms five original paper subjects, all issued in France c. 1900–05: At the Circus, Carnival in Nice, John Sellery’s Tour of the World, Street Scenes, and Gulliver’s Travels.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Carnival of Shadows","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
