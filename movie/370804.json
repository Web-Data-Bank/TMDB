Collectively this nine-hour essay explores circumstances of toxic contamination around the former US military bases in the Philippines as the locus for a meditation on historical amnesia, colonial privilege, and the consequences of unchecked militarism. Interweaving both cinéma-vérité and interview footage of Filipino victims and their families, environmental spokespersons, and community activists, along with early photographic material pertaining to the Philippine-American War, partisan songs, historical texts, and landscape photography, both ﬁlms are an attempt to construct a work capable of rendering some measure of this human and environmental tragedy and the complexities of its remedy.","popularity":0.995,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":277,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wake (Subic)","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":3}
