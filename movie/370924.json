Her very first attempt at erotic cinema, The Good Girl was released for free on the internet and downloaded over 2 million times in just a few short months, heralding Erika’s successful career as a successful modern adult filmmaker. This short film is now included in her 2007 feature film, Five Hot Stories for Her. The short film, a twist on the classic “pizza guy” porn, is about Alex (Claudia Claire) – a beautiful, smart, successful, and confident businesswoman. She is single and thinks a lot about sex, but rarely acts on her fantasies, which always seem too impulsive. It’s only after a conversation with a friend, who is infinitely more impulsive than Alex, that she is inspired to try something that a ‘good girl’ wouldn’t do.
