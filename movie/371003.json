Who is underneath the mask? This is the story of a group of high school kids - all popular, good looking, \"most likely to succeed\" types - who amuse themselves by pulling pranks on unsuspecting students and teachers. At their core lies a cruelty and shallowness which comes with the territory of privilege. One night, a prank goes horribly wrong, a teenager is killed, and the gang covers it up as a drowning accident but five years later, their lives are turned upside down when a local is killed by a serial killer wearing a haunting Marilyn Monroe mask. Soon, the gang are killed one by one in manners mirroring the pranks they pulled in high school. Is it revenge? Is it karma?","popularity":2.76,"poster_path":"/a7CSbUGnz8ddzVIjkHwdFIYwSSz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":69224,"logo_path":null,"name":"Juniper Post","origin_country":""},{"id":20659,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinedigm","origin_country":""},{"id":69225,"logo_path":null,"name":"ExtraOrdinary Casting","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-01-09","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"No one is laughing now.","title":"Kill Game","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":17}
