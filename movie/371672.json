Captured GI Pete Sherman is one of a group of POWS slated to be interviewed on Tokyo Rose's radio program. Instead of advising his comrades to surrender (as ordered), Sherman uses his innate Yankee knowhow to hoist the treacherous deejay on her own petard. Managing to make his escape, Sherman hooks up with the Japanese Underground, convincing anti-militarist Charlie Otani to aid in a kidnapping plot aimed at Tokyo Rose.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sERpY0Q11yW5d7962ZEE0hTBrFq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4182,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pine-Thomas Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1946-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"THE BEHIND-THE-SCENES DRAMA OF THE NO. 1 WOMAN WAR CRIMINAL!","title":"Tokyo Rose","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
