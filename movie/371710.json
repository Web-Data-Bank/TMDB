Martta was a Seamstress who lived in Helsinki during the Second World War. She was one of the post-civil war (in 1918)  generation for whom the war had meant a disappointment in the system and failure in unity of the Finnish nation. The legacy of the civil war had left systems of persecution in place for those with socialist ideals. Martta and her fellow revolutionaries were determined to continue the resistance movement although they knew that at worst it could cost their lives. Martta was imprisoned twice before she was shot. She was an idealist, whose seemingly harmless, naive beliefs in peace and justice  were the most dangerous traits a person could have at the time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7pfKVyWMN4FvyHAy2xCwUrK5Mx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33385,"logo_path":null,"name":"Illume","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2015-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"So great is to die and live for happiness and freedom","title":"Seamstress","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":6}
