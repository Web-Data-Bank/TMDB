This once-in-a-lifetime movie special takes place inside the tight-knit Parton family as they struggle to overcome devastating tragedy and discover the healing power of love, faith and a raggedy patchwork coat that helped make Parton who she is today.  The film is set in the Tennessee Great Smoky Mountains in 1955. It is neither a biopic nor a musical about Dolly's whole life and performing career, but rather a family-oriented faith-based story about the incidents in her and her family's life around the time she was nine years old.","popularity":4.295,"poster_path":"/nlwSzj95aWrwTTGQcynoS2K6YZO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114326,"logo_path":null,"name":"Magnolia Hill Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Coat of Many Colors","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":30}
