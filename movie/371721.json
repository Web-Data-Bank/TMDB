Collins is plagued by a rival gang, led by deceptively boyish Curly, who has been stealing jewelry from the rich and famous. Our \"hero\" tricks the other crooks into turning the gems over to him, intending to use them for his own profit (he throws the cops off track by hiding jewels in a plate of spaghetti!) But sweet heroine Sunshine eventually persuades Collins and his cohorts to turn honest.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/k9GOWmG31H0MeOYYxsqLaZ5hf0w.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/5Va1Ie5c4sjfEYqixQ3L8qg7fKu.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1928-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Master of Them All...Triumphs Again...As he did in \"The Unholy Three.\"","title":"The Big City","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
