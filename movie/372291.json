Weaving together first-hand accounts with rare archival images and an iconic soundtrack, the documentary allows those who were there a chance to relive the experience and gives an entirely new generation an opportunity to feel the magic of that time.  The film will also take an important look at Woodstock’s legacy through the eyes of today’s musicians and activists examining why Woodstock and all it symbolizes is still relevant in today’s culture.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cX7fi2ueZN1pCU8plMvFRTFIThU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-08-14","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Woodstock: Now & Then","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
