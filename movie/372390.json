In this movie, Viktoria is a 40-year-old woman who seems to have gone mad and develops a compelling and moving monologue of moments that marked her existence. Viktoria (Sophie Marceau), a bishop's daughter and pastor's wife, talks to herself and reveals her intimate world: her joys and woes, her childhood and her relationship with her cheating and aloof husband. She voyages from life to life, seemingly playing several roles. She remembers, dreams, fantasizes and hallucinates, bringing back to life her late husband, mother, father and friends.","popularity":1.622,"poster_path":"/csVe0WaPDIO6DgBN0s32veDn4WA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2015-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Spiritual Matter","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":16}
