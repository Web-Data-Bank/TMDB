Thompson sent a message to his wife that his friend Smith was ill, and it was his duty to perform that spiritual work of mercy, \"comfort the afflicted,\" hence he would not have her wait up for him as he might be late. Smith did likewise, using Thompson as the object of his humane consideration. This done, they start off to make a night of it. First they visit the gilded throne room of a temple of Bacchus, where they moisten their parched spirits with dry Martinis. They are soon in a most glorious condition. Smith suggests the show where \"Amateur Night\" is on.  - Written by Moving Picture World synopsis","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":13131,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Mutoscope \u0026 Biograph","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1908-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thompson's Night Out","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
