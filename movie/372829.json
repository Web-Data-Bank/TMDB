Normally, each individual frame of film depicts the entire space but only a moment in time (1/24 second). With tx-transformed films, it is just the opposite: each frame shows the entire time but only a tiny portion of space (the left side of the picture is \"before\", the right side is \"after\"). â€”Virgil Widrich","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rtzVsOZvPvvE30831bW1TmSdG1V.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70043,"logo_path":null,"name":"Virgil Widrich Filmproduktion","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1998-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"tx-transform","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
