A freethinker, open-minded and proud, he also displays a certain arrogance when it comes to his successes. For some time now, his wife Béatrice, a Canadian government minister, has been bedridden, suffering from a mysterious depression. To escape from his wife’s agony, Boris begins a relationship with a colleague, Helga, and gets close to Klara, a young woman who works as a maid in Boris’s home. The sudden appearance of a stranger in his life forces Boris to come face-to-face with the world, with everything he takes for granted, with all his certainties.","popularity":1.876,"poster_path":"/n5tJdoRM7xBxWQPS14RiV5V5EZS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13839,"logo_path":"/125UdB9wgDkY2RNpjgCiKyk3Dll.png","name":"Metafilms","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":806,"logo_path":"/kcNh09qqR2Pkw1JAzRW4CommrW4.png","name":"Téléfilm Canada","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":9116,"logo_path":"/vYeYdFxDWoqBzFgYz2Tf9d2ZseE.png","name":"SODEC","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2016-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boris Without Beatrice","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":11}
