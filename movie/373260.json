Never before in human history were so many people murdered in a planned way.  In such a short time and in such a small space.  Between 1940 and 1945, the Nazi Germans deported over a million Jews, nearly 150,000 Poles, 23,000 Roma, and 15,000 Soviet prisoners of war, and about 25,000 prisoners of other nationalities here.  The overwhelming majority of them perished in the camp.\r This film is dedicated to the memory of each and every one of them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vQPNoQAMXxcwpqA09RHclFR8m5e.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Auschwitz","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
