The various story lines cross each other time and again in different places and times, with their own theme scores that evolve as time passes. The main event in the film is the Second World War, which throws the stories of the four musical families together and mixes their fates. Although all characters are fictional, many of them are loosely based on historical musical icons (Édith Piaf, Josephine Baker, Herbert von Karajan, Glenn Miller, Rudolf Nureyev, etc.) The Boléro dance sequence at the end brings all the threads together.","popularity":6.075,"poster_path":"/oLuN16b1zPTT7lqVl0OsgV56diC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1742,"logo_path":"/kxKBr4UuwuVdMhuunZ579vWd5in.png","name":"Les Films 13","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1981-05-27","revenue":0,"runtime":184,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The film is a musical epic and it is widely considered as the director's best work with Un Homme et une Femme.","title":"Bolero: Dance of Life","video":false,"vote_average":6.782,"vote_count":55}
