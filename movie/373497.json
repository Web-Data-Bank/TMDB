From the unavoidable Granny Sarfati, at odds with her husband and daughter Fortunée, to Mongola, the former \"Clodette\", the comedian invited to a journey in his so particular universe, revisiting in no particular order the classics of the children's literature, the masterpieces of the French song and even the verses of the great Molière. A varied program, between great successes and new sketches, interspersed with choreography by Kamel Ouali.","popularity":0.63,"poster_path":"/3I9M6OMA3HoZOHFiz7BUKgK3Uba.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95083,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kakouphonie","origin_country":""},{"id":95088,"logo_path":"/grsYkiJSktvdYgNw7BAlF6wF8Kk.png","name":"Warner Music France","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2002-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Élie Kakou au Dôme de Marseille","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
