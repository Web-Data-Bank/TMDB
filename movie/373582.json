In a series of “guided monologues” people – from kindergarten children to the vintage ages – are contemplating and reliving their lives. When they forget about the camera and they turn their eyes inside, the film starts. They are alone with themselves in front of us and then we are alone with ourselves, with our life, long passed, very present. Through the film the intimate diaries are silently drawing in the back a picture of human life of the last hundred years.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nsnXo2wUNYybHIm0lXIyGsyBYQt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":54089,"logo_path":"/gAuDLJVyiDjkEMkMrGmfdYaw6OE.png","name":"Gustav Film","origin_country":"SI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"2009-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Letter to a Child","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
