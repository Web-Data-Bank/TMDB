Nearly two hundred thousands children are thought to be born of the union of French women with German soldiers. Women weren't the Germans' only conquests; indeed, occupied Paris swarms with all kinds of homosexuals—from Genet to Cocteau—who treated with the occupier. The fate of those women who were shaved at the end of the war for fraternizing with Germans is the punishment of a France that lied down and slept with the enemy.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/kvR2jX2OMkcERn6PAs4N0iqV31P.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24678,"logo_path":"/2XgHpNJsBm6jh4CVrgqpLQemXmU.png","name":"CC\u0026C – Clarke Costelle et Cie","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2011-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love and Sex under Nazi Occupation","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":4}
