Composed of community-generated performances, re-enactments and extemporaneous recordings, this film functions doubly as an examination of a rapidly changing material culture in the present and as a historical document for the future. Whether the resultant record is directed towards its subjects, its temporary residents (filmmakers), or its Western viewers is a question proposed via the combination of long takes, materialist approaches, selective subtitling, and a focus on various forms of cultural labor.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SR","name":"Suriname"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tjúba Tén / The Wet Season","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
