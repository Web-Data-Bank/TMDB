For the image we created a gridded score of movements, both within the frame ('subject moves right to left') and between the camera and the subject (zooms, pans, tilts...,) using this as a shooting script. The sound was derived from an old journal, read out loud and then cut-up into the same units of time as the image, ranging from 3 seconds to 1/4 second. Assembling the material was largely mechanical, following the predetermined score. That a tonal portrait of a person emerges was an after effect; we thought of the film as a structural or indexical system of sound/image relations, and viewed the soundtrack as a linguistic experiment, working with the building blocks of speech. - LT","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"X-TRACTS","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
