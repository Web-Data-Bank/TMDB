When she arrives at her destination, she's dismayed to find that the gorgeous villa is actually a rundown B&B owned by Wu (Richie Jen). It turns out that Wu's friends, hoping to drum up some business for the B&B, falsified a few details about the state of the property on the internet. Angered by the deception, Fenfen packs her bags and leaves the next day. But, when she loses all of her luggage on the boat ride, Fenfen has no choice but to head back to the island.","popularity":1.805,"poster_path":"/6xEOwuCsxkjawHbZQMNFO9q8Ro1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2015-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All You Need Is Love","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3}
