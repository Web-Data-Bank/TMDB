With parents who are busy working long hours in the fields, third grader Jose Ansaldo often turns to his teacher, Oscar Ramos, for guidance. But Jose is undocumented; he was born in Mexico. Like many other migrant children, he is beginning to understand the situation — and the opportunities that may be lost to him through no fault of his own.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/b3ZUdqzXZkOxE6WA1o0WGKTmFwR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-12-28","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"East of Salinas","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
