The film follows two generations of skaters - from the underground culture in the late 70s, with skating on secret locations in the forest around Oslo, to the commercial explosion when skating was legalized in 1989. The film says something about the Norwegian governments overprotective policy, but it also shows the paradox of how the prohibition led to a unique and creative environment.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aPZEZSDYdfQDrKAL2xLyaA9gDhY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2006-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Board Control","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
