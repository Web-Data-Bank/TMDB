A longtime fan of Maddin, Losier (best known for other inventive portraits of underground film icons like Tony Conrad and George Kuchar) hoped to document him as well; \"I hate my voice and face,\" Maddin replied, and sent her Super-8 footage of his hands instead. Losier interwove the footage into her own distinct tale, shot like a surrealist 1920s silent film. A must for fans of Losier, Maddin and ingenious cinema in general, MANUELLE LABOR was completed for the Berlin Film Festival (where Maddin was the guest of honor). - Jason Sanders  A collaboration film by Marie Losier and Guy Maddin. Two sisters, five brothers, a doctor and two nurses and the miraculous birth of a pair of hands, but whose hands?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Manuelle Labor","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
