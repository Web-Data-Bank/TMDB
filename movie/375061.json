Popular television actress Hitomi Kuroki stars as Yuko, an ice-queen TV news editor who is approached by a mysterious man from the PTT Ministry. The man offers her proof, on videotape, that a major university is bribing a particular government official to overlook a massive media merger. The secret transaction has already resulted in the death of one investigator. Yuko promptly broadcasts the damning footage, and high-ranking bureaucrat Aso (Takanori Jinnai) is forced out of office.","popularity":0.745,"poster_path":"/18NKYtdPTFDkGh1VdUCbR2FTz89.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":194517,"logo_path":null,"name":"Asmik Ace Entertainment","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2000-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Frame","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":5}
