Unable to write enough to keep his publisher's royalty advances coming, he seeks out a woman he imagines is a prostitute and interviews her for material. He is also inspired to utter some poetry, which his brassy, outspoken wife identifies as coming from the famous homosexuality-advocating mystical German poet, Stefan George. This inspires Walter to take a closer look at the gay scene, and he quickly becomes a sort of celebrity there.","popularity":2.161,"poster_path":"/3ojBfXXAvjmHpey7P81Hdu1Mkmu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33352,"logo_path":null,"name":"Trio Film","origin_country":""},{"id":8568,"logo_path":null,"name":"Albatros Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1976-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Satanâ€™s Brew","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":24}
