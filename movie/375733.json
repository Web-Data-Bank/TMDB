Before there was a “music business” there was Henry Stone, “The Record Man”. From distributing records out of his '48 Packard to establishing TK Records as the largest independent label of the 1970s, Henry had an ear for hits. His funky eight-track studio and chart topping family of artists including KC and the Sunshine Band, led to the original Miami Sound and birth of Disco. When his empire collapsed on a baseball field in Chicago in 1979, Henry didn’t miss a beat launching Miami Freestyle. Turning personal tragedy into an opportunity to empower others, through Henry Stone we witness the dramatic arc of the record business from inception through the digital age. With photographs unearthed after 40 years, THE RECORD MAN captures a forgotten musical history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":71483,"logo_path":null,"name":"Beacon Films LLC","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BS","name":"Bahamas"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Before there was a music business there was Henry Stone","title":"The Record Man","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
