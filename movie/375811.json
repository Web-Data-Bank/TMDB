Everything seems to go well at first. Her producers, two sisters, are two wacky but lovable characters, and Sybille dives into the adventure with them, putting aside her family life. But, from the unlikely choice of actresses, the successive rewrites of the script and the financial issues, the wonderful dream turns into a nightmare.

One thing is certain, nothing will happen as planned.","popularity":1.718,"poster_path":"/upsupJT2huiyuCuAW9MAukM4U9x.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11246,"logo_path":"/4YZ5CQZkJa2FIKGtjLLoKhNOAIw.png","name":"La Région Île-de-France","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":2926,"logo_path":"/9c6iLKfw1Ho3ikxkFqz5TPn3Ht.png","name":"Alexandre Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":208,"logo_path":"/bxQYlRhQu6nbohBEL0SWz8xIAGy.png","name":"Bac Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":11620,"logo_path":"/f3hRdCaK1w9qH1Qs8nLd2L2bae1.png","name":"OCS","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2016-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Arrête ton cinéma !","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":37}
