The film traces the lineage of the evolution of global governance from Samuel Zane Batten’s 1919 manifesto New World Order, through to Hitler’s vision of a 1000 year Reich, to the modern incarnation of the conspiracy which has its roots in the evil deeds of people like George H. W. Bush, David Rockefeller and Henry Kissinger.","popularity":2.189,"poster_path":"/4yqWwvnx5Ej8AGDmohYGZXVn1lY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5601,"logo_path":null,"name":"InfoWars","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":132,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Invisible Empire: A New World Order Defined","video":true,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":14}
