Granted unprecedented access to the inner workings of the Burning Man organization, the filmmakers spent 18 months with the founders, organizers, artists and participants to document the full complexity and diversity of the Burning Man community. But, true to its title, the film goes beyond the city they raise in the desert - revealing the Burning Man's plans to bring its unique culture to the rest of the world. BEYOND BLACK ROCK tells, for the first time ever, the real story of Burning Man - from the inside out.","popularity":1.461,"poster_path":"/umogHq0Wbun9BIcWyMFxraYU3WP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Burning Man: Beyond Black Rock","video":false,"vote_average":3.7,"vote_count":5}
