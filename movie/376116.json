Then Mr. Ford created his machine that would change the world.  But, compared to other cars of the time, the T was a piece of junk. The T was a type writer to the Bentley laptops of the time. Crude, bare, uncomfortable.  But, it was cheap, and better than a horse.  A cheap car is better than no car, and to prove this point, we take 2 cheap cars and one Ford Model T across 819 miles of dusty, rocky, steep, ruthless Utah desert. No amount of rocks, scrapes, crashes, leaked fluids or lost wires will stand in our way.
