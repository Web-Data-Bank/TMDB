Almost four years passed and the only stimuli that engaged Owen were Disney films. Then one day, his father donned a puppet—Iago, the wisecracking parrot from Aladdin—and asked “what’s it like to be you?” And poof! Owen replied, with dialogue from the movie. Life, Animated tells the remarkable story of how Owen found in Disney animation a pathway to language and a framework for making sense of the world.","popularity":7.642,"poster_path":"/dAbgluMr621IDx0fvyzVOYtAhEX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7315,"logo_path":"/pn1L5r75URMfY1XQB38NLKTlX3U.png","name":"A\u0026E IndieFilms","origin_country":"US"},{"id":10978,"logo_path":"/ez34P9AcoWcuBWcPkZ3exAxzODZ.png","name":"Motto Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":72627,"logo_path":null,"name":"Roger Ross Williams Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When he fell into silence, movies gave him back his voice","title":"Life, Animated","video":false,"vote_average":7.609,"vote_count":129}
