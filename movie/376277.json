Concentrating on the period following his rise to political prominence in 1894 until his death in 1925, the movie is couched in terms of heroes who look heroic and villains who look villainous. Huge numbers of extras and vast battle scenes dot this production, and well-known Hong Kong and Taiwan-based movie stars appear in many cameos.","popularity":0.942,"poster_path":"/o2C1XlrLRcsfZf5maugnbOlMrf6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14104,"logo_path":null,"name":"First Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"1986-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":156,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Story of Dr. Sun Yat Sen","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":4}
