The latter is the director of the company owned by his wife, who merely signs contracts and invoices. Manuella suffers from a trauma that dates back to adolescence, when she witnessed the rape and then the murder of her older sister Nathalie (Cathy Greiner) by a simple-minded man. A shock she never recovered, which leads regularly to depression, even violent crises requiring treatment that administers her husband through bites. In order to change his ideas, Jean-Pierre takes his wife to winter sports, in Haute-Savoie where he rented a chalet (between Megève and Chamonix). He meets his mistress Françoise (Catherine Ringer), accompanied by her Patrick, his friend, who is aware of the liaison of his girlfriend with Jean-Pierre. In fact, the latter, with the help of Françoise, plans to sink Manuella into irreversible madness, in order to seize his property.","popularity":2.584,"poster_path":"/hmu0ydp69vZPurqW1W47fsbVZHH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21735,"logo_path":null,"name":"Comex","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1982-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bizarre Marilyn","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
