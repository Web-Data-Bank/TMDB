After a particularly crappy week, he goes off on a tirade and harasses a gorgeous random passerby, only to discover that it’s Rochelle Marseille, one of New York’s up-and-coming authors. Moving to make amends in an effort to preserve his media clout, Ray is stunned when Rochelle gives him more than he ever thought she would.","popularity":1.759,"poster_path":"/yZdCmQ806QqkFscC3K2TT9WE0ce.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How To Tell You're A Douchebag","video":false,"vote_average":3.6,"vote_count":9}
