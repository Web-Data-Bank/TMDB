It's time to meet their families and to plot the happy event. In-laws seem to understand perfectly: passion for TV series unites luxury, Romanian music of the '80s and brandy. Especially brandy. As the bottles are emptied, misunderstandings begin to appear. Three couples, three visions on marriage: fast and opulence (with white doves and Holograf Fuego), traditional wedding (with musicians and tent), or a youthful? Different options, different camps. No one fails. Moreover, the two parents-in-law remember that they met once, 25 years ago. They were in different camps. Now that miraculously brought back to life to face. Follow great challenge. It takes a miracle that this wedding is to be held.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1RImxvm5UKsPUW9rPDbX4tkFr8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":43844,"logo_path":null,"name":"MediaPro Entertainment","origin_country":"RO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2014-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In-laws","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":6}
