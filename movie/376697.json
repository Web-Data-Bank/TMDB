This world premiere recording of the production from choreographer Alexei Ratmansky (after Vasily Vaynonenon) and the Bolshoi Ballet, features the standout soloists Natalia Osipova and Ivan Vasiliev. Although set in revolutionary France, The Flames of Paris was intended to serve as an allegory for contemporary events in the Soviet Union. The ballet premiered in 1932 on the anniversary of the October Revolution, and one of its main characters was the population - revolutionary in mood and ready for action. Not surprisingly, The Flames of Paris was quickly included in the ranks of works which were always presented for major anniversaries.The choreographer Alexei Ratmansky has attempted to make maximum use of the preserved fragments of Vasily Vainonen in his new ballet.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gAbPRqMiegiJiXwTtQa9ddo7Rh0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15790,"logo_path":null,"name":"BelAir Media","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":71870,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bolshoi Theatre","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2010-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Flames of Paris","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
