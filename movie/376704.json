But director Fujii has taken the \"behind the scenes\"-concept to unprecedented heights with this unique documentary offering a close look into the world of Kiyoshi Kurosawa, the auteur. Scenes from the surprisingly low key and relaxed production of \"Bright Future\" are of course sprinkled liberally throughout the documentary, but between these we are treated to interesting and revealing interviews with actors, producers and Kurosawa's many other collaborators. And perhaps the most surprising thing of all is how much of Kurosawa there is, talking candidly about his working methods and the philosophy behind it all.","popularity":0.961,"poster_path":"/uqBD9UQ1OjIxmG6AqhZtgE4hdh5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27904,"logo_path":null,"name":"Uplink","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2003-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Ambivalent Future: Kiyoshi Kurosawa","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
