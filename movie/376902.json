The opera offers a rare opportunity for two baritones to star alongside one another as the title Lothario and his faithful yet conflicted servant, Leporello, as well as three memorable female roles—multifaceted women who both suffer the Don’s abuses and plot their revenge.","popularity":0.855,"poster_path":"/x3UHvAjDWeD0z88r4pp7yrjVALV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15005,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Metropolitan Opera","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":175,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Metropolitan Opera: Don Giovanni","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
