The English painter unmasked his subjects in a provocative and ruthless manner. Deformed bodies, grimacing faces and the materiality of colour make us aware of brutality and sexuality, existential abysses and the fears of existence. Author Melvyn Bragg accompanies the painter throughout his day. This begins in his London atelier, leads us on to his favourite pub and ends up in gambling club in Soho.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vxxP09EI0AxaspjAQ7HCyK7SQ4W.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Francis Bacon","title":"Francis Bacon","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":3}
