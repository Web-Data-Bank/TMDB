Based on improvisations and collective creation work, groups of pre-schoolers, adolescents, and university students from different social, cultural, and political origins, recreate history through mise-en-scenes that come from their own imaginations. The film articulates this creative vortex in a multiple-narrative flowing cinematic mosaic that gives an account of contemporary Chile by reliving its past.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2004-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Clever Monkey Pinochet versus La Moneda's Pig","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
