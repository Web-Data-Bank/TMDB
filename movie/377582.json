The prize: $25,000. After both contenders make holes in one, a psychological battle begins. Woody crunches celery. Dapper drives himself into a sand trap. Woody proves himself too light for quicksand; Dapper sinks. At every turn, Dapper proceeds to lure and trick poor Woody until Woody's game seems lost. All that Dapper needs to win is a short putt into the cup, but he's seized with a magnificent case of hiccups. Woody wins and hiccups dollar bills!","popularity":0.691,"poster_path":"/cjHYy9HAtYu61oNFL88rVLp92pJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8520,"logo_path":null,"name":"Walter Lantz Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1959-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Tee Bird","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
