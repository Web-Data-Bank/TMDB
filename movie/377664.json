They also share, however, some seriously challenging living terms; all three of them suffer from Progressive Muscular Dystrophy, and thus - with a pinch of characteristic black humour - refer to themselves as the \"Skin and Bones\" guys.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Skin and Bones","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
