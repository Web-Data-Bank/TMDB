The film depicts J. Jordan, a sort of ’80s Maynard G. Krebs/Rube Goldberg gadget-loving guy who quits his job as a bored and hassled local television news photographer to make a movie about a guy who quits his job to make a movie. Cook describes his film as “the TV dinner of movies ... it didn’t cost a lot, but it’s still pretty good.” Technically assured and full of heart, laugh-out-loud ambience and humor, and off-the-wall hipness, Cook’s debut will warm the hearts of anyone who has made, or dreams of making, a movie. “A clever comedy, well worth seeing.”—Ted Mahar, The Oregonian. “The film’s delightful atmosphere wins you over.”—D.K. Holm, Willamette Week","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Only a Buck","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
