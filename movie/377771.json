In 1960, \"Discos Fuentes\", the oldest record label in Colombia, decided to bet on a new way of producing music, releasing the first mixed album that combined the most important songs of the year. That first album marked a new era in the music production industry in Colombia. \"It was like bringing home the disco every Christmas\". Since then, the \"Hits\" have been a mandatory purchase every December.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/djWKNoI71PxIxKhfID3jvAILYJj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72170,"logo_path":null,"name":"Laberinto Cine y Televisi칩n","origin_country":"CO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"}],"release_date":"2015-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa침ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Hits from yesterday, today and always","title":"Tropical Hits","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":2}
