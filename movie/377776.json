Cavallone followed only loosely the poem, interpolating some of its most outrageous content within the story of a film director, Paolo (Gianni Garko) who’s undergoing a deep personal crisis. The first part (which producer Giuseppe Tortorella labelled \"mythological porn\") is set in Italy, as Marco is working on a film called Maldoror, and focuses on his tormented relationship with a married woman, Monica (Jane Avril). According to the script, it was filled with excessive and cruel images, extracts from the film-within-a-film which were liberally spliced within the plot, and in their uneasiness somehow predated Pasolini’s Salò.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maldoror","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
