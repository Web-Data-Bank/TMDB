Originally conceived as a spy thriller with socio-political overtones, Shadowcrack quickly assumed the form of an outline for a series of Vaudeo™ vignettes with partially overlapping plots to be developed in the near future. The Vaudeo™ concept denies the superficial juxtaposition of sound against image present in so-called \"music videos\" but relies on direct access to the experiential centers of the audience.  To this end, Rhythm and Noise suggests playback level louder than normal.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-01-16","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shadowkrack","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
