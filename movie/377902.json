In this film, the viewer is invited to experience the garden as an embodiment of ma, a Japanese concept that conveys both time and space... The aesthetic of the film is the message, it has the quality of an experimental film, a conceptual film-an artwork in itself. Good balance of music/visuals/titles. If not as compelling for some viewers as for others, still rated as very effective. Makes one want to visit the actual garden and experience its spiritual energy. â€“ Art on Screen","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ev5s2ogbSEXHjwQH2QtL6NiCkwW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":157580,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Program for Art on Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"MA: Space/Time in the Garden of Ryoan-ji","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
