Nothing has escaped this cultural phenomenon: radio, song, personalities, major events and social phenomena have fuelled this delirious, biting and funny humour because it is more true than nature. Reflecting a generation, RBO has clearly contributed to giving humour its nobility within Quebec culture. 2ndt of 5 dvd of the box set: ROCK ET BELLES OREILLES: THE COFFRET ET THE BONUS.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A9pELPIzIZTUPiSpffywvC8ri6d.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24004,"logo_path":null,"name":"Amérimage-Spectra","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2001-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rock et Belles Oreilles: The DVD 1988","video":true,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
