But when the time comes to migrate to Africa, his stork family is forced to reveal his true identity and leave him behind in the forest, since he is not a migratory bird and would not survive the journey. Determined to prove he is a stork after all, Richard ventures south on his own. But only with the help of Olga, an eccentric owl with an imaginary friend and Kiki, a narcissistic, disco-singing parakeet, does he stand a chance to reach his goal and learn to accept who he really is.","popularity":10.794,"poster_path":"/aKwgGlhdhdbx0duJhCRojkEZXgU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8675,"logo_path":"/nhGrnKdP6GFXLk6fbLARjQNSMET.png","name":"Walking The Dog","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":98153,"logo_path":null,"name":"Den Siste Skilling","origin_country":"NO"},{"id":100215,"logo_path":null,"name":"Knudsen \u0026 Streuber Medienmanufaktur","origin_country":""},{"id":50163,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ulysses Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":13351,"logo_path":"/sj74baixfiB8uIdTJWzU26E25ef.png","name":"Melusine Productions","origin_country":"LU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"LU","name":"Luxembourg"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2017-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Their adventure is the destination.","title":"A Stork's Journey","video":false,"vote_average":5.938,"vote_count":120}
