Oskar just doesn't understand why nobody wants to film it. For his friend Benny, however, who works in a video store, the situation is crystal clear: there are simply no highlights. So Benny gradually adds more and more elements that he hopes will be a great success. After all, he wants to help Oskar achieve an international breakthrough: In addition to baby animals and sex, racism and homosexuality must of course not be missing. While Benny lets his imagination run free, Oskar gets drunk. And so Oskar's fine story gradually becomes a cliche monster that doesn't leave much of his original idea.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kDSc4LQETwXjc2VLG43jjSoPLsl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oskarreif","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
