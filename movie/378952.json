Utilising CIA documents that have recently been declassified this programme identifies specific individuals who worked at the top secret base in a variety of roles – the radar specialists, pilots and security guards.  Their personal testimonies provide a unique impression not just of the work that was carried out, but of the site itself.  We reveal just how tight security had to be to keep the development of the U2, A12 and HAVE BLUE aviation programmes under wraps.  This is a film that concentrates on delivering history and factual accuracy in a fresh and engaging style – one that answers the question ‘what really happened at Area 51’?","popularity":1.108,"poster_path":"/r2Hon7dXhSwA151YLCVUC6Xfkp0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7521,"logo_path":"/fRqMjLjyAqThtEg9P9WKCXLmCpJ.png","name":"National Geographic","origin_country":"US"},{"id":77667,"logo_path":null,"name":"Warehouse 51","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"US military site Area 51 is the subject of wild speculation and conspiracy theories.
