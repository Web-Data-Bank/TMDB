A woman has murdered her husband. That's clear enough. Now the woman is in a psychiatric hospital because it seemed clear to the judges that she was not fully competent. Her doctor, who is helping her a great deal, has problems of his own. First, he is against the cookie-cutter treatment practices of his hospital, second, he is on shaky mental ground himself. Then he violates his therapeutic ethics by carrying on an affair with the woman he is treating.","popularity":0.65,"poster_path":"/bEvgGNTdKKDyzBwF41kde8ph7Cl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3676,"logo_path":"/mel4PnFPw1LuxgzUJzoh7VxpIRq.png","name":"ASA Film Production","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"1972-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dangerous Kisses","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
