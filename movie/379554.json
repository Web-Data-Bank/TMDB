A vast majority of these workers are undocumented, leaving them at the mercy of the large agribusinesses who hire them, the crew leaders who contract them and the landlords and businesses that profit from the seasonal arrival of migrant workers. Their \"undocumented\" legal status allows for a system of exploitation that leaves workers and their families to endure conditions and wages that rarely meet international human rights standards. Immokalee U.S.A. documents these daily experiences, leading the viewer to examine their own role in the issues migrant workers face in the U.S.A.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gp0ByPBbAcfZ19rBIP8a7mB3ny.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Being an account of migrant farmworkers in the U.S.A.","title":"Immokalee U.S.A.","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
