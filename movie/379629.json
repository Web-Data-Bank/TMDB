It was 1977 in New York and Bruno’s run would soon come to an end.  Enter The Superstar…  Superstar Billy Graham burst onto the scene in the WWWF, unseated Bruno Sammartino, and rewrote the rulebook for pro wrestling heels. And now he wants you to join him on a journey to that pivotal year, where he’ll tell you everything that was happening within the walls of the largest wrestling federation in the world!  We pick up the action in April of 1977, just before Graham gets the strap, and we follow the action into 1978, when Backlund takes it.  The Sammartino title change…the McMahons…the ‘Wiz’…Japan…Backlund…the backroom dealings…missed opportunities…Albano’s antics…working the blade…the TV tapings…  …all that and EVERYTHING that was happening in 1977/78 in WWE!!!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qzDVRaaTd0VBjY0M169UikvTARe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":129,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Timeline: The History of WWE – 1977-1978 – As Told By Superstar Graham","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
