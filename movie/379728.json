Close-ups, fragments, and views without a horizon create the impression of flatness. Plants with their symmetrical mirror images on the water turn into graphic elements. Similarly the sharp reflexes of light on the waves, the shadows of the fish, like echo sounders, make visible the uneven ground of the riverbed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1932-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fishing in the Rhön (at the Sinn)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
