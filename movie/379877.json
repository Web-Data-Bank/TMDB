She follows the cycle of optimism, building and eventual decline, meeting people who 50 years on bear witness to the effects of housing on real families, striking a contemporary chord with the theme of immigration and gentrification affecting working class communities. The irresistible nostalgia of scenes from the 1950s, 60s and 70s is tempered by a realisation of the force of history at work.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3RdT6Ad9Q8pF2Wn3Ozj5fMxR429.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Out of the Rubble","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
