Hand-processed and altered images (16mm film) form a labour-intensive, formal questioning of the medium. Female and male masturbation, flowers being taken apart and being put back together, extreme close-up shots of fabric and the practice-kissing of a mirror create a visceral, humorous and tumultuous experience of these personal memories.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Solitary Acts (4, 5, 6)","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":2}
