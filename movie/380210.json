The overly prideful sherif and his lawmen are outsmarted and Parsons escapes. In the desert, he falls in with a reverend, his wife, and their group of missionaries, who hope to establish a church. After coming under attack by a tribe of Native Americans, Parsons strikes a deal: in exchange for the safe keeping of the missionaries, he takes the reverend's wife for himself. Ultimately a parable of Christian values, the film's narrative establishes and overcomes obstacles that test the virtue of men in the American West.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jI4ZdWTMcv9qTxuTIeeYoGMI4Nr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32484,"logo_path":null,"name":"William S.
