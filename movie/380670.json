We always think we know what's missing from our lives in order to really make us happy, don't we? If only I had that car, or that job, or if only I could lose those 15 pounds, then I'd be happy. Really? How often do we want something only to find out that it wasn't that great after all? Sometimes we ask God for things and if he doesn't deliver right away, we start questioning whether God really understands or even cares. Do we really trust God? Do we trust that God is good and sees a bigger picture than we ever could? It's easy to want what's right in front of us, but maybe God knows what's better for us, and sometimes we just can't see it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/66rsFfQ4vXBi28V85YrneVkCPT8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7747,"logo_path":null,"name":"Storefront Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"If God really cares about us, why don't we have what we want?","title":"Nooma Kickball 006","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
