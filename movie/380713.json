It's easy for us to fall into a mindset of viewing \"our\" world as \"the\" world, because it's all we generally see. We're constantly bombarded with images of the latest styles and models of everything, and it can easily leave us feeling like what we have isn't enough because we see people that have even more than us. But how does what we have compare to what most people in the world have? Maybe what we have is enough; maybe it's more than enough. Maybe God has blessed us with everything we have so we can bliss and give to others.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/Am6jkCMlK75NuuZ8tZGT1otUjri.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72718,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dot and Cross","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Is it possible that God has blessed us so that we can be a blessing to others?","title":"Nooma Rich 013","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
