What does it look like? For a lot of us it's a hard thing to fully understand. If God is an infinite spirit with no shape or form, how can we possibly relate to that? And what about Jesus? He said he came to give everyone life in its fullest. He came to show us how to live. Maybe it's through trusting Jesus and living the kind of life he taught us to live—a life of truth, love, justice, compassion, forgiveness, and sacrifice—that we have a relationship with God. Maybe the way we live every day, every single choice we make, determines how in tune with God we are.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1fKNKrziHuRWyPGOp9f62zuMMjc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72718,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dot and Cross","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Are our lives in tune with God's plan for the world?","title":"Nooma Rhythm 011","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
