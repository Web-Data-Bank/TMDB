Really? The same way I love my wife? What's up with the word \"love\"? It doesn't have much meaning when we use it so loosely. Maybe we don't really get it. Maybe we don't understand what real love is. What it involves to really love somebody. What it means to give yourself to someone else. We mistake things like friendship, commitment, or lust for love, but God wired us a certain way to experience all that love was really meant to be. Not to hold us back or to make us miss out on the best that life has to offer. God created love, and wants us to feel it all in the way it's meant to be felt.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6Yd4QF4ruVUhEesjrC5sDy4nnR8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72718,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dot and Cross","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Could love be the most misunderstood and misused word in our vocabulary?","title":"Nooma Flame 002","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
