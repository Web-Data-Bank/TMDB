It's easy to get overwhelmed with appointments, gatherings, to-do lists. But what are we really doing with our time? Many of us are running from place to place and it seems like life is just passing us by. We're doing so many things, a little bit of everything, and yet it doesn't feel like much of a life. But most of us find it hard to say no. We feel obligated. There are so many good things to do. So many good causes to join. But while we're busy doing all these good things, are we missing out on something great? Maybe saying no would be easier if we knew what it meant to say yes.","popularity":0.805,"poster_path":"/14l56Ysxy1noWWpyDumaHbRbjaE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Are we so busy that we miss out on what we're supposed to be doing?","title":"Nooma Shells 020","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
