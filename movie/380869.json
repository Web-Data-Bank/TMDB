No one shared more in the actions and passions of his era then William Sloane Coffin Jr., a hero for civil rights, peace and activism, a legendary clergyman who received international acclaim for his antiwar speeches and messages of international peace. This rare and vital documentary intercuts fascinating footage of the Class of 68 with President George W. Bush (Yale 68) at the White House as well as profound and moving comments and reminiscences by prominent members of the Yale class of 68","popularity":1.21,"poster_path":"/a1npXSa5IKsJzd3mHIAFThdBJjx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3052,"logo_path":"/kqP7DC8cUCzDSI5SXiJKJKmQg1K.png","name":"Troma Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Splendor and Wisdom","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
