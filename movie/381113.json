There were pieces of paper and screwed up, transparent gels hanging from the ceiling; it was quite dense in some parts. I wandered through it with a camera and then other parts were filmed on the rooftop at St Martins. I think I was just very much trying to find my way in a whole new area of work. I remember it involved a lot of refilming, which was the part I liked. The process was very fluid, similar to painting. I got quite interested in the specks of dust and dirt on the film and the re-filming gave me a chance to look at that more closely. Probably the thing that attracted me to film was the light ... the kind of floating quality you can get, images suspended in light.'","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wyp2kNPOMvwYmEvEIE8YnChBrnP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1970-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shapes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
