She displays self-destructive behaviour as a result of a terrible tragedy. He is unhappy, has suppressed feelings and incessantly phones the council about all kinds of trifles. Where she seeks extremes, including excessive sex and lies, he is introverted. When these two damaged souls meet at work, a bond results and they go traveling together. But their inability to communicate breaks the vulnerable relationship and this again has tragic consequences.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/7FKPU345zCt3q4Lltvps1YcBEbH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97560,"logo_path":null,"name":"SURPLUS PROJECT","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":114202,"logo_path":null,"name":"MOVement","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":15974,"logo_path":null,"name":"MCMC","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2017-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Communication & Lies","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2}
