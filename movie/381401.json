In this film, Dr Hannah Fry tells the story of Ada's remarkable life. Born in the early 19th century, Ada was a countess of the realm, a scandalous socialite and an 'enchantress of numbers'. The film is an enthralling tale of how a life infused with brilliance, but blighted by illness and gambling addiction, helped give rise to the modern era of computing.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/9RecfdBsPqugrvLUgtFUueXzUDl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Calculating Ada: The Countess of Computing","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":3}
