He is given three telegrams, one of which is for the president of the Camber of Deputies. Excited, Antoine runs his bicycle into a truck and loses the telegrams. What follows is an amusing and agonizing search for the missing messages. He is assisted first by a glum, wise-beyond-her-years little girl, Amelie; an off-duty police superintendent, a schoolmaster, a cookie-tin maker and a fireman. The harmonica musical theme is played by Flore Falvey.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pIF20tqLbPWR8KPaTx6DRsd7b3E.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1950-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paris Incident","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
