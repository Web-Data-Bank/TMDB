While they are leaving Jacobs tells the Driver about the horrors he saw as a photographer, but he regrets his inability to help war victims. Jacobs answers the driver curiosity about why he is a photographer by saying how his mother taught him to see. He gives the Driver the film needed for a New York Times story and also his dog tags to give to his mother. When they reach the border, they are confronted by a guard who begins to draw arms as Jacobs begins taking pictures, trying to get himself killed. The Driver drives through a hail of gunfire to the border, but finds Jacobs killed by a bullet through the seat. The Driver arrives in America to visit Jacobs' mother and share the news of him winning the Pulitzer prize and hand over the dog tags, only to discover that she is blind.","popularity":3.221,"poster_path":"/2VM8NZcMm78zCoQJi59ei6SWmwx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10039,"logo_path":"/b8w4LldQolMKiLZw4FQJBcXSDGI.png","name":"Anonymous Content","origin_country":"US"},{"id":53728,"logo_path":null,"name":"BMW Films","origin_country":""},{"id":110056,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zeta Film (MX)","origin_country":"MX"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Powder Keg","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":65}
