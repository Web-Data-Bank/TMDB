Under its original title, 'Les vêpres siciliennes', the libretto was prepared by Eugène Scribe and Charles Duveyrier from their work 'Le duc d'Albe', which was written in 1838 and offered to Halévy and Donizetti before Verdi agreed to set it to music in 1854.  The story is loosely based on a historical event, the Sicilian Vespers of 1282, using material drawn from the medieval Sicilian tract 'Lu rebellamentu di Sichilia'.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5dLufLtEqYnAZtWmirroPrnLmDE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42411,"logo_path":"/9osTYTduHkM6Il6XixUTfdNcaoP.png","name":"C Major Entertainment","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2010-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":169,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I vespri siciliani","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
