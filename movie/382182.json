A tragic tale of doomed love interlaced with the age-old themes of jealousy, lust and intrigue, has ensured Tosca its place in the top ten of opera favourites. Probably the best contemporary soprano-tenor combination (a couple in real life, too) Daniela Dessì and Fabio Armiliato are ranged against a worthy opponent in the form of Claudio Sgura as police chief Baron Scarpia.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cejGtNZp4aJrBhTeNClMW8460L2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19492,"logo_path":null,"name":"ArtHaus","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2012-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tosca","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
