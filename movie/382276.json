There’s what looks at first like a normal sexual triangle: a girl, Pumpgirl, who works in the local garage and thinks she’s one of the lads; a freewheeling jack-the-lad, Hammy, who’s in love with no-one but himself; and a woman, Sinead, neglected, lonely, out looking for a joyride of her own. Three people, one night; a night of sex and violence, resulting in consequences - and not just for them alone.","popularity":0.622,"poster_path":"/ivBO0hvHfImQ4KMbB4D1c6vqFlp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2009-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pumpgirl","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
