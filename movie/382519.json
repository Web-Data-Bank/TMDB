Learn how the Declaration of Independunce and the first airplane flew into being. Music rules in three melodic misadventures including Kitty Cat Blues, a furocious Flamenco dance-off and a hip-hoppin` feud between Tom and DJ Jerry. This volume runs hot and cold with some roaring lion lunacy in Africa, tail-kicking kangaroo action in the Australian Outback, chilly silliness involving The Abominable Snowmouse, cockeyed hockey and an all-out snowball war. Get ready to travel to your fun zone with everyone's favorite cat-and-mouse team.","popularity":0.919,"poster_path":"/plHm2NG1O5BgQMj0mF1s5Ps7onA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tom and Jerry Tales, Vol. 6","video":true,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
