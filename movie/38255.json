He does not do too well in school, and that makes him an easy victim for the hard core bullies in the new school. When the group leader is moved to a private school, Kim is accepted in the gang - as long as he provides cigarettes for the other members. This of course leads to a confrontation with the school teachers, his family and eventually the gang members.","popularity":0.887,"poster_path":"/i1UmlR0OB8CMZqFvVpfAo5mzcPI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46509,"logo_path":null,"name":"Statens Filmcentral","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":107412,"logo_path":null,"name":"Saga Kortfilm","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":118,"logo_path":"/AiBorgNTCS1lT1FdFPYheax9jfF.png","name":"Det Danske Filminstitut","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"1981-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Historien om Kim Skov","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
