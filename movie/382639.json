They decide that there is no reason in trying to fit-in, trying like ‘everybody’ to be ‘somebody’, choosing instead to mock the establishment, as pranksters – calling themselves The Nobodies. Now, what’s their plan? Frankly, they have no idea, until Laer, a transfer student, joins them and takes them on a warpath of self-discovery and no return.  Faeryville is a dystopian teen movie, a stylish coming of age film about youth making sense of their idealistic dreams in our increasingly surreal world - a fictional manifestation of very real issues prevalent in the Post 9-11 world.","popularity":0.655,"poster_path":"/i4JSIIZA4ShWVLw0JidOtP4njUd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Faeryville","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":2}
