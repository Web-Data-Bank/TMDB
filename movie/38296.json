When Violet Heaney's three daughters return home for her funeral, each sister finds her own way of coping with her loss. For Teresa, the eldest, it's herbal tea, obsessive cleaning and hectoring her long-suffering husband, Frank. Catherine, the youngest, resorts to retail therapy, industrial quantities of marijuana and manic phone calls to her elusive boyfriend in Barcelona. Middle daughter Mary seeks consolation in professional detachment and the arms of her lover, Mike. Like Mary, Mike's a doctor. Unlike Mary, he's married... The sisters soon discover that their early memories have grown fuzzy over time and the past becomes fuzzier still as they attempt to cope with their mother's parting.","popularity":0.717,"poster_path":"/yaiAengnco6NO6weyxKqTeGlPJA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Before You Go","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
