The seamless loop of an unyielding contestant's ineptness solidifies as an almost cruel experiment, as the stretched time limit imprisons him in a fruitless guessing game. As 1000 seconds tick off the clock, our relationship towards the disembodied head of the contender shifts from sympathetic support to uncomfortable pity. One cannot help but wonder if this humiliating effort is really worth the grand prize at stake.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Match","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
