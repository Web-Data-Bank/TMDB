In his earlier film, a landmark of cinematic deconstruction, Jacobs re-photographed and manipulated a film fragment from the dawn of cinema, penetrating the image to reach the sublime. In Anaglyph Tom, the artist applies the anaglyph 3-D process to the original footage, engaging the experience of depth perception as the subject of his relentless experimentation and dizzying interventions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hyNL6fAAUonwyBryrLdWCorGq43.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anaglyph Tom (Tom with Puffy Cheeks)","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":1}
