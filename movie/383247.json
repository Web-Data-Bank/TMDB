Included are a rare clip of Red's famous vaudeville routine, Guzzler's Gin; a prevue for his film Public Pigeon No. 1; and footage from his Emmy Award-winning show, with guests Jack Benny and Ed Sullivan. Ed enacts such memorable characters as Cauliflower McPugg, Clem Kadiddlehopper (teaching Pedestrian Polo), Willie Lump Lump (showing how to make a salad), Deadeye, and BBC newscaster Lord Beaverhead. You'll also see rare clips from rehearsal show with Martha Raye, with uncensored ad-libs and goofs never aired on TV, and the classic blooper that occurred when an onstage cow contributed its own unique \"ad-lib.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/KL1MzEXcY8supet61uhxxRKSPS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Celebrate Red's Reign from Vaudeville to Movies and TV.","title":"Red Skelton - King of Laughter","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
