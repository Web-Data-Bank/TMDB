In an effort to find this so called happiness, Trevor attempts to make a positive change in himself and the world around him. There's just one problem: he hates himself and the world around him. And the results are always the same for Trevor whose shallow, self-absorbed outlook makes any change nearly impossible.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":73352,"logo_path":null,"name":"Esoteric Productions in association with Practical Mullet","origin_country":""},{"id":73353,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stringtown Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sunny Day","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
