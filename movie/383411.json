A Steve Rogers penalty squared it at 11-all but he then missed a desperate late field-goal attempt and at full-time the scores remained locked. For the second consecutive season the weary Grand Finalists were required to play a mid-week rematch three days later (the NSWRFL were forced to play the replay on the Tuesday and not the following weekend due to the upcoming 1978 Kangaroo tour, with the Australian team due to leave that weekend for their tour. The drawn GF also forced the Australian Rugby League to hold off on naming the touring squad until after the GF replay with as many as 12 players from Manly and Cronulla in contention to be selected).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"1978 NSWRFL Grand Final: Sea Eagles vs Sharks","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
