When the home-owner turns up, Shawnouk pushes himself between the man and the gun. In the end, he is the one with blood on his hands. He goes into hiding in the vast forests of Qu√©bec. In the search for his roots, he faces regret, pain and anger. Fire and smoke, the ancient trees, and the music of his ancestors help Shawnouk to face his biggest challenge: the confrontation with himself.","popularity":0.776,"poster_path":"/9uMbQEWsmMujVvsqZ4RQyDoipG5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29201,"logo_path":"/93Cu4sHMvJLgCwk9wpQY5xrb3XA.png","name":"Les Films de L'Autre","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2016-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Before the Streets","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":6}
