As she interviews people who know them, such as Joan Jonas, the group shoots ‘artistic’ scenes of themselves – but Borden feels they aren’t fully grappling with issues of sexuality and politics. Are they a serious group – or just friends? After showing an early edit of the film to the group, its members, upset, close ranks. Undeterred, Borden incorporates the group’s arguments into another edit, filming larger groups commenting both on the original one and on consciousness-raising groups in general. Uncredited voices include those of Barbara Kruger and Kathryn Bigelow.","popularity":0.69,"poster_path":"/qPC45LFk81SfmtHKNo7jVzTQpdq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1976-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Regrouping","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":2}
