A variety of interventions on the film strip are combined with an atmospheric sound design to create a subjective story of displacement and containment. In an age when experience is increasingly mediated through digital technologies, Taanila seeks out an alternative language in the sensuous surfaces of the celluloid material.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/r3eTfUGQCAUAE4vm88AdBflmwSG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113605,"logo_path":null,"name":"Elokuvayhti√∂ Testifilmi","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2016-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tectonic Plate","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":3}
