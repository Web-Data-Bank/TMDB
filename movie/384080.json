Minus 10 juxtaposes footage of the artist’s father in Los Alamos and on the way to Tinian Island with an interview with a woman in Japanese about the bombing. Minus 9 aligns an American nurse’s eyewitness account of the bombing and its aftermath with aerial landscape shots blocked by a blinking blue circle which could represent a mutant sun, an eye, planet Earth, an afterimage, or the inverted “rising sun” of Japanese national symbolism. Minus 8 and Minus 7 show excerpts from a documentary, The Growth of Plants overlaid by running text describing radiation-induced botanical mutations. Minus 6 explores current American war policies and ethics contrasted against the histrionics of Adolf Hitler; as the dictator gesticulates on-screen, women’s voices recite a diatribe by Goebbels.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uWEI0L2Bsl7g5LxShgPKnpOQ6Wr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Let Me Count the Ways: 10...9…8…7…6","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
