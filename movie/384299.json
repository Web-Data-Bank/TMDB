His wife died of cancer over a year ago and their 19-year-old son, Etienne, went to pieces and made off for Bogota. He hasn't been in touch for 6 months and Michel is desperate to find him. He leaves - without much money - arrives to Bogota and is mugged on the first day but manages to strike up a friendship with a Belgian girl who - reluctantly at first - helps him on his quest and eventually becomes a close friend. In an unbelievably short time, and following the flimsiest clues, he finds his son who has tried to find a new family among a white-clad Indian tribe in a near-accessible place. I won't spoil it by telling you any more - but there isn't much more.","popularity":0.735,"poster_path":"/hineFqxiCtBmX8RiMgsVeYMGJsH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2015-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Au nom du fils","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":3}
