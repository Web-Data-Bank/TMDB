It becomes a layered, timeless drama in which Norma is the archetypal successful woman struggling to retain her dominant but vulnerable position. Hasmik Papian's lyrical and intense interpretation of the title role accentuates the striking similarity between a Druid high priestess and a modern opera diva. Conductor Julian Reynolds guides the brilliant cast, choir and Netherlands Chamber Orchestra to great heights, providing a refreshing new take on the chef dâ€™oeuvre of bel canto.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pIWFtxzLtK9pVigKotDdDynXtjY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vincenzo Bellini - Norma (De Nederlandse Opera)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
