It hasn't stopped Siméon from dropping everything, or, more precisely, letting go the little that he had, to secretly follow her. Oscar, his roommate, a musician with sleepwalking tendencies, and Antoine, a novelist lacking inspiration, quickly follow in his footsteps. Here they all are at the end of the Earth, which is to say, on an island. It's quite possible that these four are linked by something beyond their comprehension. Perhaps simply a taste for adventure. Or the desire to add some fantasy and a touch of the romantic to their lives.","popularity":0.9,"poster_path":"/64wd1v3gS1An9D8qRrrJJ5W6mtd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2016-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marie and the Misfits","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":10}
