Based on Ryunosuke Akutagawa’s short story of the same title (1922), Kawaguchi’s film moves the original early 20th-century Izu Peninsula to present-day Taiwan, where the strength of family ties is singularly put to the test. Yumiko (Machiko Ono), who married against her parents' wishes, has struggled on in stubborn determination since her husband’s death, moving her family from their Tokyo home to the verdant, rural Taiwan village of her in-laws. Her son Atsushi, strongly conscious that in ethnocentric Japan he is \"different,\" is in a state of rebellion against both the society in which he has grown up and his mother. In their new home the family rediscovers the bonds that unite it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mWWqfUp915ACsa2RUJZjnE3eLp2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14602,"logo_path":"/t9eqx5QCHtu8LxxgYzivqrJAosp.png","name":"AMUSE","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":136620,"logo_path":null,"name":"J\u0026K Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":136621,"logo_path":null,"name":"Plenty Co.","origin_country":""},{"id":136622,"logo_path":null,"name":"Torocco","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2010-05-22","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rail Truck","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
