The birth of her daughter into an increasingly perilous world has unsettled everything in Beatrice's (Anne Louise Lambert) life. Her growing unease prompts Beatrice to undertake a journey - an investigation into human nature, a confrontation with the fears of our time, and a search for clues that will ultimately give her an answer to the central riddle of the film: why has humankind set the stage for its own extinction? The director’s preoccupation with humankind’s tendency to self-destruct was one factor that lead to the creation of this complex film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2rgRf5L8xOW5y2NdtdPsvp33zyV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16577,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ronin Films","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":110645,"logo_path":null,"name":"Periscope Productions","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1993-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Breathing Under Water","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3}
