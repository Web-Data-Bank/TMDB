Then tensions and tail fins flare in \"Bubble Buddy,\" as SpongeBob irks everyone with his provocative new best friend: a silent--yet rather demanding--bubble. Surprisingly witty, fast-paced humor and fresh, detailed animation make watching each quirky show a visual and auditory treat. But the great lure of SpongeBob is that his dilemmas relate equally well to young and old.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spongebob Squarepants: Lost at Sea","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
