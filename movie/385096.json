Volatile union meetings and tension-filled interactions on the picket line provide an inside view of the tensions and conflicts inherent to labor negotiations.  Due to a lack of funds and a fire at Kartemquin which necessitated a re-edit of the film, the film was not released until 1980. Filming then began a year later on Taylor Chain II: A Story of Collective Bargaining.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":13042,"logo_path":"/k57hcv8sELrZCf1j33FDBNGDpF6.png","name":"Kartemquin Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Taylor Chain I: A Story in a Union Local","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
