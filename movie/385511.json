Told from the perspective of a single lazy susan (rotating tray), this is dark comedy and social commentary at its best.","popularity":1.095,"poster_path":"/1vLtXRTVH1MpKClqe5GEcfTfYig.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":62890,"logo_path":"/1PsXdNm6bJS6abuhUeYKO9CGSEb.png","name":"Stage 5 Films","origin_country":"ZA"},{"id":188375,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stealth Donkey Moving Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2015-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Xhosa","iso_639_1":"xh","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lazy Susan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
