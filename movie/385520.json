The Cantrills are well known for their 'colour separation' films. To create these works they shoot a scene three separate times on black and white film stock, using a different colour filter each time. In the lab, they combine these three films onto a single Eastmancolour print. This process creates dramatic transitions in colour that the Cantrills liken to the vibrancy of Technicolor.  Though the footage here was shot in the mid-’80s, it was only last year that they edited it into this fifteen-minute movie. Structurally it’s simple enough: just a series of views of various parts of inner Melbourne, from panoramic wide shots to close-ups of the sides of buildings. The soundtrack blends and warps familiar urban noises – cars, buskers, the ringing bells of trams – into a kind of musique concréte.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The City of Chromatic Dissolution","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
