Poly then takes us through a range of emotions of what can only be described as a carthartic episode before ending on the same unnerving note it began with. Brambilla composes the video brilliantly, creating mesh-like layers of Polyâ€™s face that scatter and converge as he explores the idea of mulitplicity within the human psyche.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ghost","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
