The linkage of the individual segments was achieved by applying an old game used by Surrealist artists in the 1920's to explore the collective imagination. That game, called \"Exquisite Corpse\", was first applied in literary form by a group of poets each supplying one line of the total poem. In drawing, a group of artists would take turns drawing one part of a human figure, without seeing what the others had contributed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qcky31bI2VRPPVtgLBTRELe1FO9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1992-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Exquisite Corpse","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
