Howl, the film, recounts this dark moment using three interwoven threads: the tumultuous life events that led a young Allen Ginsberg to find his true voice as an artist, society's reaction (the obscenity trial), and mind-expanding animation that echoes the startling originality of the poem itself. All three coalesce in a genre-bending hybrid that brilliantly captures a pivotal moment-the birth of a counterculture.","popularity":8.183,"poster_path":"/4gy0rUIaaao1nx6pr1Dj1WpslcO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8924,"logo_path":"/5NTQun1m6FVJVOVHOubJ5SqyMvi.png","name":"Rabbit Bandini Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":53303,"logo_path":null,"name":"Werc Werk Works","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-08-26","revenue":1183258,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Obscenity Trial That Started a Revolution.
