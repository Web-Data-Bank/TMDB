Sparrooabbán (Me and my little sister) shows what it’s like to be a minority within a minority. Suvi describes how her little sister Kaisa wishes to be accepted as she is. Like her sister, Kaisa is a Sami, but also in a relationship with a woman, and she also works as a deacon. There are obviously more constricting communities in the film than only one.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jY1qUI4RvhePRU6GakSHqinQuPk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74022,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vaski Filmi","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2016-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"},{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Me and My Little Sister","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2}
