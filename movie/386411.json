Ultimo is a 90-minute black-and-white silent film, with scenes from the director's meanderings in La Palma (Canary Islands, Spain) interspersed with lines from Rizal's poem, which was written a day before the hero's execution in 1896. Waiting, ambivalence, and re-membering —themes usually tackled in literature and criticism— are investigated through a series of images: the mundane elevated to the affective through a sensibility that does not shy away from pushing the boundaries of art. This version is scored by a post-kundiman duet of guitar and banduria.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/joGTyhjc5b7smCxgxEPjpGRFr7n.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60183,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kamias Road","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ultimo: Different Ways of Killing a National Hero","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
