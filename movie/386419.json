But  what starts out as a practical joke, extends to become a curious portrait of what could either be a petty fraud or the worldâ€™s most secret miracle. A film crew tracks his bizarre pilgrimage as magic and religion, faith and doubt, real and unreal blur and melt to the point that one of the director becomes one of the characters. The film traverses all descriptions, before ending as both an affirmation of faith for the faithless and a criticism of faith for the overly faithful.","popularity":1.212,"poster_path":"/y4p319SgebK9Rbw8E2wtqji3m85.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16821,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmless Films","origin_country":"PH"},{"id":115348,"logo_path":null,"name":"Noerfilm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"O ye of little fate!","title":"Son of God","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
