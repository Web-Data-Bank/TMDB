Jo is the bright spark in Claireâ€™s recently darkened reality; a new friend in an otherwise isolated world. The two young women hit the town to let off some steam-and find themselves in trouble with local law enforcement. In the blink of an eye, Claire discovers that Jo is not what she seems-not at all-and her easy friendship with the lighthearted, young woman splits open to reveal the truth. Luminously shot in black and white, Josephine Doe is a raw exploration of family trauma and mental health that shows the thin line between our realities.","popularity":1.632,"poster_path":"/dddw96PHoVaheCBMz6jyPgv1K93.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":106683,"logo_path":null,"name":"Byrdhouse Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Josephine Doe","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":4}
