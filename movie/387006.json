Fitzpatrick's Traveltalk series, takes the viewer to the capital of British India, Delhi. Visits to mosques and temples are followed by a tour of the shopping district, Chandni Chowk. The streets are filled bullock carts and only a few cars. Much is made of the peaceful co-existence between Hindu and Muslim. This is followed by a visit to the Viceroy's palace in adjoining New Delhi with a taste of the pomp and majesty of Imperial India.","popularity":1.341,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/5Va1Ie5c4sjfEYqixQ3L8qg7fKu.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1939-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Imperial Delhi","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
