The mention of a purple scarf in the notes particularly catches her attention, prompting her to purchase a similar scarf from a mysterious website that claims to sell everything, as long as one can pay the price. Soon after, Xiaomai's close friend is found dead, strangled by a purple scarf. All of this awakens Xiaomai's memories of her childhood sweetheart Qiushou, whose mother was also strangled to death with a purple scarf by an unknown killer. Xiaomai and Qiushou grew up together and fell in love, but he suddenly disappeared from her life 15 years ago without a word. She begins to believe that Qiushou has returned and may be seeking revenge.","popularity":1.981,"poster_path":"/hf5o4n95VxLImSvYrXTVTSnHZ5k.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74135,"logo_path":null,"name":"WUZHOU FILM DISTRBUTION","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2016-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kill Time","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3}
