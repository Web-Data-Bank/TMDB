It reveals much more what it is that all the “rescues” hide, right up to the present day tragedy of Greece. The radical alteration of society in Europe. The transformation of private debt into public debt which has been papered over and presented as a “rescue” has not only driven democracy to absurdity. It has shaken societies which consider themselves socialist societies with rule of law to their foundations. No one formulates this better in the film than Mario Draghi, who as a one time vice president of Goldman Sachs and present president of he ECB steers the economies in the Euro area: “The European social model is history”. “Saving the Euro will cost a lot of money. That means we will have to take leave of the European social model”. For seven years now the rescue is taking place with the help of hundreds of Billions of public money.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/b2DNwX28QCziZbIIL2uwOUCtzBP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The crisis as business model at the expense of democracy and social safety","title":"Who Is Saving Whom?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
