It is a wordless play, the only sound that of a male voice humming, then singing, from the last seven bars of Schubert’s lied Nacht und Träume, words by Matthäus Casimir von Collin: \"Holde Träume, kehret wieder!\" (\"Sweet dreams, come back\"). Schubert was a composer much loved by Beckett – \"the composer who spoke most to him…whom he considered a friend in suffering\" (Wiki)  Beckett lists five elements that make up the play: evening light, the dreamer (A), his dreamt self (B), a pair of dreamt hands and the last seven bars of Schubert’s lied.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hGPzzssmsXCalOYeXcy8lRTmlTh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1983-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Night and Dreams","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
