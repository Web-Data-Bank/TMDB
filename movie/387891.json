The biggest project of its type in the history of Calgary, Wreck City invited over 150 artists to participate. Operating on good faith, a shoestring budget, and naive energy, a curatorial collective facilitated the project, negotiated by-law, police complaints, graffiti, and accusations of aiding and abetting gentrification.  Created in a month and open to the public for just over a week, artists crafted accessible works of public art dealing with a vast number of issues and themes, including gentrification, community, and the institutionalized art world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"WRECK CITY: AN EPILOGUE FOR 809","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
