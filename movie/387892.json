He learns from his dim-witted best friend, Cody, a porcupine and street-con, that while he was in lock-up, the entire forest was picked clean by The A.C.O.R.N.S. Institute (Alternative Cosmetic Oils for Regenerative Natural Skin-care). No acorn was left behind. With winter just around the corner, it's a potentially devastating blow to all forest critters. So, Frankie has no choice but to bust into the brand new, state-of-the-art, rodent-proof A.C.O.R.N.S. Processing Plant and take back all of the acorns! Though a seemingly impossible heist, success would not only save the lives of his forest friends, but it would also give Frankie a chance to win back the love of his life, Lola, a local \"show squirrel.\" Sadly, Lola has been burnt by too many of Frankie's false promises in the past.","popularity":3.319,"poster_path":"/lf3sDJKPknEivxb4B4YV2KiuTzq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74297,"logo_path":"/h0mOKPNNS1NnLbXm9lCMygeGSdD.png","name":"Awesometown Entertainment","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":81139,"logo_path":"/iKM2lqNJZQEzzbEID0LJCMG3Fap.png","name":"Vanguard Animation","origin_country":"US"},{"id":20613,"logo_path":"/tXbbUdhyQuF6ERC7Qu2BbbaeA1a.png","name":"SC Films International","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"May Contain Nuts!","title":"Get Squirrely","video":false,"vote_average":5.233,"vote_count":15}
