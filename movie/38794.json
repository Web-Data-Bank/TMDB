Two traditionally rival Turkish families, \"Seferoglu\"s and \"Tellioglu\"s are competing for the \"Green Valley\". The winner will be determined by Daver Bey, who has a beautiful young daughter, Leyla. Both families try to arrange a marriage between a man from their family and Leyla, so that Daver Bey will be inclined to give the green valley to his \"relatives\". Tellioglus, who are behind in the race, desperately find a final solution: They will fake their idiotic butler, Saban, as the highest ranked Ottoman soldier in Egypt: Tosun Pasha.","popularity":4.995,"poster_path":"/8U9Uq3FBPERWrCCzwSeqpxVLdu6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4639,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arzu Film","origin_country":"TR"},{"id":113140,"logo_path":null,"name":"Yeni Stüdyo (Seslendirme)","origin_country":""},{"id":162296,"logo_path":null,"name":"Yeni Stüdyo (Renklendirme)","origin_country":""},{"id":162297,"logo_path":null,"name":"Flet Elektronik (Ses)","origin_country":""},{"id":162298,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mimeray (Afiş)","origin_country":""},{"id":162299,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vipsaş Post Production (HD Restorasyon)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"1976-02-01","revenue":698200,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Green Valley is ours!","title":"Tosun Pasha","video":false,"vote_average":8.063,"vote_count":88}
