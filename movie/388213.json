This surreal world is just on the edge of consciousness; suburbia through the looking glass. Every adult wears painful braces on their straight teeth, couples coordinate meticulously pressed outfits, and coveted family members become pawns in this competition for acceptance. Greener Grass explores one’s willingness to endure present pain in exchange for future validation – or at least a perfect smile.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/h1Pxk0R6nJV6a67JZ1P8cSTGgTc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75852,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gulp Splash Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Greener Grass","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":10}
