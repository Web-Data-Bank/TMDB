It is also a concentration of built infrastructure, capital and architecture. Megalomania is a short film that perceives the city in total construction; inspired by the incomplete states of world icons such as The Shard and Burj Khalifa. The built environment of the city is explored as a labyrinth of architecture that is either unfinished, incomplete or broken. Megalomania is a response to the state of many developing cities, exaggerating the appearance of progress into the sublime.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":16878,"logo_path":null,"name":"Factory Fifteen","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"MEGALOMANIA","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
