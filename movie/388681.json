The film dramatizes the origins and demise of this effort, called the \"Scaieni Phalanstery (the term is derived from \"phalanx\" and \"monastery\"). Among the socio-political commentary that is conveyed throughout, there is an important collusion between the army and the wealthy landowners of the time, and as the film points out in its own way, neither of these groups has ever been convicted of socialist/utopian tendencies.","popularity":0.621,"poster_path":"/tUwt4dfO3FMmQoIezDwZG20KzRz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"1979-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":161,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Phalanstery","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
