The quiet Armand settles into Montreal after his wife has left him and before long, he continues the momentum when an ill-considered liaison with a nubile woman ends on her insistence. Next, Armand gives his heart to a frustrated housewife, though this decision is hardly well thought out. In the meantime, a gay man who rents out a room in his apartment has unfulfilled longings directed at the unsuspecting handyman. L'Homme a Tout Faire won a Silver Medal for \"Best Picture\" at the 1980 San Sebastian Film Festival.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tcWKMhnCAJRAUVJONxe1jqk5Ros.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Handyman","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
