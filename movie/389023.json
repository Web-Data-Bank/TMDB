Rebellions and revolutions had followed one after the other for decades. Though things were beginning to settle down some, it was still a time when one had the feeling that anything could happen. This film tells the story of one boy's sexual coming-of-age during that time, punctuated by a peasant rebellion sparked by religious concerns (Catholicism had been officially suppressed). The lad has a crush on the wife of the Army man sent to put down the rebellion. He also has an affair with a local woman and briefly runs away with a pretty young prostitute.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5hTX1aV5FCLgjFA7WsxO0hvYvDo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1972-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Days of Love","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
