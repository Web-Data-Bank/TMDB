They have even shipped a piano to the site, so that Chopin can continue his work. However, what promised to be a warm, sunny vacation turns sour as the locals disapprove of Sand, the servants are surly and mysterious, and the monastery is cold. She has her revenge, however. She wrote the book A Winter in Mallorca about her miserable winter retreat. This film follows that book closely, with concern for historical accuracy, which did not increase the Spanish filmmakers' popularity with their countrymen.","popularity":0.678,"poster_path":"/sGFGYcgYtQUPVcYogAYGiFkEa2w.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Català"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Winter in Mallorca","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
