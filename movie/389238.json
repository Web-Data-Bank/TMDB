Over one hundred tiny mechanical birds, smock dresses engulfed with gardens and flowers, and countless rainbows of beaded necklaces and brooches are just some of the items Norma treasured during her lifetime. Tina reflects on her mother's life, allowing an immersive exploration of Norma's extraordinary legacy. Norma's Colours is a reflection of the film maker's fascination with the psychology of the collector, expressed in her film making with the enlivening of the objects themselves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8cpKabWzY8zFqTBxd3iy4fHQrmH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Norma's Colours","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
