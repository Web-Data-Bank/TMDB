Resuscitating stardom through sheer proximity can translate to forced pairings or superfluous music making, but credit Santana himself with minimizing such missteps. A fusion artist before the term was coined, the erstwhile Mexican street musician long ago extended his technical reach and broadened his stylistic palette by hungrily assimilating different styles of music. Accordingly, he shifts gears easily, whether soloing behind Dave Matthews, trading lines with legendary saxophonist Wayne Shorter, or spicing up a hip-hop excursion with Lauryn Hill.","popularity":2.048,"poster_path":"/b0q8MxRGsdJzv9mBwM5myQNGOBx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6065,"logo_path":"/cqeGQjOZgO0CssjjP4CqZaosZrT.png","name":"Arista Records","origin_country":""},{"id":2933,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tenth Planet Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":186426,"logo_path":null,"name":"StarFaith","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":147,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Santana: Supernatural Live","video":true,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":10}
