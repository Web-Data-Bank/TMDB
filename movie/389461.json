Beginning with a photograph taken in the 1950s by historian Jibrail Jabbour the film journeys further into Jabbour’s photographic archives, then into the filmmaker’s personal photo-diary of the Israeli invasion of his hometown, Saida. Zaatari probes that obscure compulsion to document one’s environs, in the everyday or when enduring a potentially fatal event.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This Day","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
