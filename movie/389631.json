An older man walks through the corridors of a half-empty airport, and he feels alone and sad. He takes a photograph out of his wallet, tears it in two and drops it on the moving walkway. Both are torn in two. A girl in Paris is alone with a cat. A man arrives in Warsaw, and a woman is there to meet him. She drives him to his parents’ home. An accident, a murder—nothing alters the imperturbable course of life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'aube à l'envers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
