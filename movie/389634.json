George, a sculptor, is a cynical bully while Crawford (who narrates the story) is a narcissistic, idealist in search of spiritual and emotional perfection. While they endure their time in the small flat, Crawford discusses his attraction for the landlady's daughter, Aga. Unfortunately, George has beaten him to the punch and has already claimed her for himself. Crawford then begins to woo the landlady's other daughter, Anna. Their lives become more difficult when the Mirek family moves into the already over-crowded dwelling.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Poison Tasters","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
