At the centre of this small community of teenagers and their new-borns, the exclusively female staff see to it that the residents, whose family situations are chaotic, obey the rules. Keeping off-screen an often-mentioned violence, the film focuses on the daily lessons in mothering. What then emerges is everything that cannot be taught and which creates a fine dividing line between having a child and becoming a mother.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9QXFR5vaWntApJ7hTJ0HFrel8Pk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":131,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"House of Mothers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
