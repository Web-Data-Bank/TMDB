This is an important custom in their region of India, signifying the beginning of a responsible stage in life. Things go awry when the wife begins talking to flowers, singing odd songs, and having fits. In fact, the fits get so violent that she has to be physically restrained and tied down to prevent her from hurting herself. It eventually emerges that she has been chosen by a spirit which is special to a particular religious cult, the Meibis. Things proceed swiftly with her new, unsought, allegiance as she makes contact with the cult and its leader and prepares to leave her heartsick husband and child behind.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/syrKjoPp6akhrc5w6rQeOQEJjSs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80090,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aribam Syam Sharma Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1990-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Chosen One","title":"The Chosen One","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
