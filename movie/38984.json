Coco Chanel is infatuated with the rich and handsome Boy Capel, but she is also compelled by her work. Igor Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring is about to be performed. The revolutionary dissonances of Igor's work parallel Coco's radical ideas. She wants to democratize women's fashion; he wants to redefine musical taste. Coco attends the scandalous first performance of The Rite in a chic white dress. The music and ballet are criticized as too modern, too foreign. Coco is moved but Igor is inconsolable.","popularity":6.776,"poster_path":"/9j9fJLkOQ6cd9bZ0S3QkUlZE7bZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78407,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hexagon Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":7627,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eurowide Film Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2009-09-24","revenue":5753490,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Coco Chanel & Igor Stravinsky","video":false,"vote_average":6.211,"vote_count":90}
