The incredible changes and reverses in European politics and culture exert a potent influence on one aristocratic Hungarian family. Losing virtually everything in the way of creature comforts, the family tries to keep up appearances. Eventually every member of the clan falls victim to illness, syphilis and their own headstrong foolishness. The parallels drawn by director Judith Elek between the dissipation of 19th century Hungarian aristocracy and the corruption of Communist ideology in modern times are inescapable.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/f5ES4Pg53l8G36RhQOG5jmOMEEd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":55540,"logo_path":null,"name":"Objektív Film","origin_country":""},{"id":18891,"logo_path":null,"name":"Magyar Televízió Drámai Föszerkesztöség","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"1984-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maria's Day","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
