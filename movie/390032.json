Given he is not very knowledgeable about soccer, Ugo tries -several times but in vain - to obtain an appointment from Sivori. Forced to fall back upon persons being or having been in contact with the elusive star, he gets to know young forward-center Moretti and soon becomes friendly with him. The young man confides in him and tells him the whole truth about his own \"career\" : the training in a small provincial team, the promising debut alongside Sivori, the desertion of his fianc√©e, the premature decline due to a dissolute life. When Sanfelice finally meets Sivori, he finds that the star is no match - humanely at least - for Moretti and he gives up writing the book at all.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xOqZ0oGSJgJF3KAYENsIiFC00gY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1965-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Idoli controluce","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
