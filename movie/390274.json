Fluently adopting a silent-era cinematic language, the vaudevillian narrative follows an escaped prisoner (Ludlam) who seeks refuge in a Coney Island wax museum. The set-up is a clever ploy to involve the rows of wax puppets (and boxes of celebrity heads) in a whimsical deracination of gender conventions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Museum of Wax","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
