Of course that last one is often the trickiest of all. Beth falls hard for Tommy, a sexy, young Wall Street hot-shot. But just as everything seems to be falling into place, complications arise in the form of Tommy's sensitive and handsome co-worker Daniel. Beth soon learns that the game of love in the big city is a lot like Wall Street -- high risk, high reward and everybody has an angle.","popularity":8.833,"poster_path":"/xwSQ62M3B1LTpHhau4MaREIwfSy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26127,"logo_path":null,"name":"Whitest Pouring Films","origin_country":""},{"id":2341,"logo_path":null,"name":"Belladonna Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":181992,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mandate International","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-04-25","revenue":100688,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Good Guy","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":136}
