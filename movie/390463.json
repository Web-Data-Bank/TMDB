Some academics are warning that popular churches who take a firm line on issues like gay marriage, abortion and euthanasia are pushing Christianity farther away from the attitudes of mainstream society. Others believe that the fervour of charismatic faith is attracting large numbers, but ignoring a quiet exodus out of the back door. Robert Beckford speaks to church leaders in the UK, including the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, about how they see the future.  This revealing film gets to the heart of whatâ€™s changing within Christianity in the UK. It will show how the faithful are kicking back against the steady decline in church attendance, and provide evidence of a more committed, but potentially divided, future.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3448,"logo_path":"/dcA8JDfnnQPMaq8lv2CCiYrNe0S.png","name":"ITV","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2016-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Battle For Christianity is about a more confident, assertive faith replacing traditional churches in the UK","title":"The Battle for Christianity","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
