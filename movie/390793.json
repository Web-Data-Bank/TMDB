But that war - and France's 'year of terror' - began a year ago with the attack on satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.  With unprecedented access to the French authorities and previously unseen footage, five-time Bafta-winning director Dan Reed reveals the untold story of the massacre and of the first Islamic State strike in Paris at a kosher grocery store.  Key witnesses, police officers and survivors - many speaking for the first time - piece together the dramatic attacks and the unprecedented manhunt that gripped the world for three extraordinary and terrifying days.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/i63st6CukbI1IO1oYIoUkxbUQxa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95571,"logo_path":null,"name":"Premières Lignes Télévision","origin_country":""},{"id":63246,"logo_path":"/eqHEYpEbLdFHB0hsdsGAaaP3lbn.png","name":"Amos Pictures","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":3268,"logo_path":"/tuomPhY2UtuPTqqFnKMVHvSb724.png","name":"HBO","origin_country":"US"},{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/eLvjHPYZ12GR58lrDgg6MXZp2a3.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2016-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"3 Days of Terror: The Charlie Hebdo Attacks","video":false,"vote_average":8.9,"vote_count":4}
