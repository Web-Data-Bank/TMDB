A record British television audience of 18.5 million watched Dennis Taylor and Steve Davis battle it out late into the night. As midnight came and went the two men ended up level on 17 frames each, and the World Championship came down to the last black of the last frame. Steve Davis was 18 points ahead with just 22 remaining on the table but Taylor cleared the brown, blue and pink. There then followed 4 shots of unbelievable tension as Taylor, Davis, Taylor again and then Davis again missed the black. On his third attempt Dennis Taylor sank the black; with the World Championship won he raised his cue above his head and danced a jig, wagging his finger in sheer delight at the conclusion of an incredible sporting moment. Steve Davis and Dennis Taylor talk us through the entire final frame, with the drama and tension building up to the amazing finale.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Greatest Snooker Final Of All Time","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
