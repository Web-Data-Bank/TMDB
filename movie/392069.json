When Jacob was a teenager, a noniep, a Marshallese fairy known for helping troubled souls, transformed him from a simpleton into a normal young man. This favor, however, came with a cost: The noniep made Jacob promise that one day he must bestow this new-found intelligence upon another deserving person. After a lifetime of pondering this otherworldly commitment to the noniep, Jacob discovers Laninbwil, a homeless young man. Just when Jacob begins to get close to the troubled youth, Laninbwil unwittingly gets caught up in a war of mystical power between an evil Mejenkwar, a demon that possesses pregnant women, and her archenemy, the gifted, shamanic old woman, Lijimu.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MH","name":"Marshall Islands"}],"release_date":"2012-05-01","revenue":943,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Marshall","iso_639_1":"mh","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lañinbwil's Gift","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":1}
