As the American public school system fails to adapt to this century, schools in China and India produce four times the number of high school graduates as the U.S. and educate these students to a much higher level. Having revealed this frightening decline in his first documentary Two Million Minutes, executive producer Robert A. Compton next searched the world for the best high schools in the hopes of discovering a solution to America's education crisis. Then, in one of the poorest areas of America, Compton discovered a school that teaches ordinary U.S. children at an extraordinarily high academic level. This school demonstrates that American students are capable of competing academically with the best in the world given the right curriculum, the right teachers, the right inspiration, and expectation for success.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fPx6on5sztF7eyMUGcyIKJ7jZ1P.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"2 Million Minutes: The 21st Century Solution","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
