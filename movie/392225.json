He cancelled one appearance, and only weeks before this recording on October 17, 1983, his wife died in a freak swimming pool accident at their home. But he did make it, and what we have here is one of the most amazing performances ever to go down on the ACL stage. Throughout the day he was a perfect gentleman, showing up on time and acting very graciously to one and all, but once he hit the stage, all hell broke loose. The songs speak for themselves; they re ALL here.  For many years later, Jerry Lee would carry a tape of this show to play for friends (and himself, many times). When producers tried to book him again for a return performance, the response was, Jerry Lee doesn't think he could possibly do a better show.  This DVD captures all the hits and more, and includes songs that were never aired on the original TV broadcast.","popularity":0.655,"poster_path":"/lpNLpMFWjv3puCVEQEZg9t21wZ0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28897,"logo_path":null,"name":"New West Records","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jerry Lee Lewis: Live from Austin, Tx","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
