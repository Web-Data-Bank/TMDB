As this engaging story opens, a retired schoolteacher and his wife are at home with their four grown sons and one daughter. The oldest son is a teacher whose wife is expecting a baby. The youngest son is a student in New Delhi and, defying custom, his young wife opts to go live with her own family while her husband is at school instead of remaining with her in-laws. Will her behavior and that of the younger generation undermine the tradition that holds the society and family together? After the youngest son graduates and gets a job, he and his wife move across the country to New Delhi. As the siblings continue to grow and develop their own lives and families, the mother and father face a gradual and inevitable adjustment to living without them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ziw169isyFQbGqAmLvhCRXXG7WA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32413,"logo_path":"/jXHqu6xyG8l5mKwK66u5ahzYdfD.png","name":"National Film Development Corporation of India","origin_country":"IN"},{"id":193822,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lotus Films International","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1984-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Oriya","iso_639_1":"or","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maya Miriga","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":4}
