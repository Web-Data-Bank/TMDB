It features interviews with members of the film’s cast and crew alongside critics, commentators and historical figures, and includes outtakes of Medium Cool. A 55-minute version premiered at the 2001 Edinburgh Film Festival alongside a new theatrical print of Medium Cool and with Wexler in attendance, and was broadcast on the BBC, PBS and the Sundance Channel. A version of the film appears on the 2013 Criterion Collection DVD release of Medium Cool.  The documentary, which has become more an educational project than anything else and remains a work-in-progress, was expanded in 2015 and now runs approximately six and half hours (in six parts).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":75392,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sticking Place Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Look Out Haskell, It’s Real!: The Making of Medium Cool","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
