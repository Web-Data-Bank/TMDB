The water-level was low, leaving the vast bulk of the Jetty exposed in the crisp air. His film measuring change captures two thirty-minute periods of that particular day, in the unblinking, unmoving takes that have become his trademark––beginning at 8:57am and 3:12pm respectively. A belated digital companion piece to his 16mm masterpiece casting a glance (2007), this new film hypnotically contemplates Smithson's art-work in relation to its wider environment and to the humans who walk on and around its gargantuan coils.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3aXfTRRamLxrNgajjte1Zpf994f.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Measuring Change","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
