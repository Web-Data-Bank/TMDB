Adapted by producer/director Rudolph Caringi from the Franz Wedekind play Spring's Awakening, the film stars Robert Mont as Moritz and Dean Stricklin as Melchior, two sensitive youths growing up in the insensitive 19th century. Upon approaching manhood, Moritz and Melchior come to grips with the inevitable in highly unorthodox fashion. As a result, one dies prematurely, while the other retreats into himself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fUGYZObVbdnM4e3mF0l35WRRN0g.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1970-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Warm in the Bud","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
