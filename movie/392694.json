The film not only depicts an actual 3 dimensional portrait of Rapace being intricately sculpted, but also acts as a portrait of her in itself, by acting as a metaphor for the various chronological steps in the actorâ€™s process. Flying Lotus, the highly acclaimed forward thinking musician and producer provides an exclusive soundtrack of 6 different previously unreleased material, which was born out of conversations between him and Throup at the beginning of the project.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Portrait of Noomi Rapace","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3}
