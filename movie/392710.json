The work involved extensive travel around the United States, and poses an examination of just what America is/was, or what do we mean when we speak of it. Done in a series of radically different sections which collide with each other in a manner intended to provoke thinking, Plain Talk, which was made by an American and intended for American viewers, was indeed broadcast in Britain, but somewhat predictably, not in the USA.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/o5DlYPiqFT51G86dID0yPj60kb3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Plain Talk and Common Sense (uncommon senses)","video":false,"vote_average":5.75,"vote_count":4}
