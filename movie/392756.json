While dealing with the agony of his loss, Chris is unexpectedly contacted by a mysterious Russian immigrant who tells him his father did not die from natural causes. That his father was an unwitting victim of human experiments in the development of biological weapons. Pursuing the truth behind this strange revelation, Chris learns of Dr. Gurevich, the scientist who created these viruses. He meets Gurevich's beautiful daughter Anna, whose innocence, charm and intelligence ultimately become his greatest obstacle.
