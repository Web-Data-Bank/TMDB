The heat of August in Paris brings forth memories and at the same time the adult Morder is involved in a love affair. There are no scenes from Ecuador here, and none of the images in the film are used to carry the narration; instead they vaguely illustrate what Morder happens to be saying at the moment.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":99548,"logo_path":null,"name":"Trans Octo Vision","origin_country":""},{"id":49674,"logo_path":null,"name":"5 Continents","origin_country":""},{"id":99549,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Boîte à Images","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1986-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mémoires d'un juif tropical","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
