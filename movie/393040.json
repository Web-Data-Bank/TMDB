Director Frederic Sojcher visits three fellow Belgian auteurs whose ambitions outstrip their budgets, or their recognition. Max Naveaux is a projectionist who decided to take a stab at making movies himself, putting together small-scale war films whose realism was heightened by the fact that the Belgian Ministry of Defense gave him permission to use real bullets for one of his movies. Schoolteacher Jacques Hardy has dabbled in creating film noir, costume horror, and comic-book adventures, most starring his friend Christian Vranken, who makes his living as a church caretaker and insists on casting approval for his female co-stars. And Jean-Jacques Rousseau is a self-styled surrealist whose commitment to obscurity is great enough that he insists on being interviewed while wearing a ski mask.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ejCzbGgRtdySwtkjfylTTV9j2FE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":859,"logo_path":"/wK6ssskf1QaGp057lSYb6fa3Nwc.png","name":"Saga Film","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2004-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Born to Film","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
