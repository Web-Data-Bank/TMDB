That's Avram's big-time idea: he returns to Romania to start breeding watch dogs which he can later export to Italy. As it happens, he settles next to a camp of immigrants recently sent back from Rome. Thus, the Italian tension is willy-nilly reenacted on the banks of the Danube. Avram's life gets complicated. He starts having an affair with his own daughter in law, lands in conflict with his ex-immigrant neighbors and his life is literally under threat. The film ends with an unpredictable situation.","popularity":0.682,"poster_path":"/wweEV8TyzTC5gKlBF0NiajUoTdN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":83721,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tandem Film","origin_country":"RO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2009-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Floating Things","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
