I had not fully mastered the tripod and suddenly in the middle of a jerky pan from a drinking fountain the entire tripod is sent flying and never reappears. In fact it has yet to be replaced. Stacy, bored with animals sets out to explore some noises she hears and ends up discovering a merry-go-round.  When I finally catch up and help get her up on one of those huge horses for the first time, I see the look on her face, and I know. There’s the film.  I should be watching not directing.  The unplanned seems to me more interesting always, or at least more possible than the planned.  That’s really the film I’ve been trying to make ever since. - D.A.
