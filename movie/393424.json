They love their beautiful new home, and decide to throw a party. The party is partly to show off their new digs and partly because Barry, an actor, wants to butter up the producer of a soap opera in hopes that his character won't be killed off. But the O'Briens soon discover that they have to worry about death in the real world too, because a flock of demons is hiding out in one of the closets, waiting to be released.","popularity":0.734,"poster_path":"/xbFDFER7dGNvNpGqB6O1MxKXeJV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deadlock","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
