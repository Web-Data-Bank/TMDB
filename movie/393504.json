An experiential project based on 20 years of research by Kenneth Dean and Zheng Zhenman, this film illustrates the growing intensity of local traditions, as rural villages and their temples transition into a new century. Villages in this part of China are undergoing radical transformations. As land that was once public and agricultural is rebuilt and changes hands, the intricate temple system has responded. During the Cultural Revolution temples were torn down—now they are being built up into ritual alliances.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2010-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A film about ritual sensation","title":"Bored In Heaven","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
