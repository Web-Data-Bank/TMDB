Microscopic organisms in a tiny drop of water vie for the viewer's interest with birds and monkeys and other animals in their natural setting. Intelligence and awareness increase on the way toward more evolved species until it becomes clear that different kinds of apes and monkeys are fairly calculating in their use of tools and communication. One drawback is that the narration does not entertain on a par with the images captured on camera.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Risk of Living","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
