The native Korean director Sung-Hyung Cho tries to understand this by accompanying several Koreans from different backgrounds in their daily lives. The film shows the country and its people in a way, as it is rarely done in Western media, non-judgmental and respectful towards the people.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aEHfIO5vmTtTyqkUTWivElvz91R.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9291,"logo_path":"/g6GYZXQrjB86Z5ocVliUZF1i3Tz.png","name":"HR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":16052,"logo_path":"/zuTtCXQa9NWiUnydXdpNIr9DDcn.png","name":"Cine Plus Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"KP","name":"North Korea"}],"release_date":"2016-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Brothers and Sisters in the North","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":9}
