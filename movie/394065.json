A groundbreaking invention that changed the world forever. The film shows Selandia and the creators receiving worldwide acclaim. But for two of them success was short-lived. They died under mysterious circumstances shortly after the maiden voyage of Selandia. On the brink of the World War, and with Germany and England showing great interest in this invention, is it too farfetched to believe that these deaths were more than coincidental.\r - Written by Michael Schmidt-Olsen","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/v5XGCkn5ijOjCmeanaw0KG2XfNx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75901,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chroma Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2012-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"SELANDIA: The ship That Changed the World","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
