Every household seemed to have a dog. Some were friends who shared his explorations and roamed free on adventures of their own before meeting an untimely death or simply disappearing. Some were huge, savage beasts who prowled around like the hounds of hell. This film is his memorial to those times, those feelings and to the dogs themselves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1993-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Darra Dogs","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
