From the slums of Kolkata to Vancouver's Downtown Eastside to a barbeque joint in Central Texas, Dirt digs deep into the webs of meaning and feeling attached to that deceptively simple 4-letter word. An odyssey into all things unclean, the film features animation to make Hieronymus Bosch blush and music from Godspeed You! Black Emperor.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xKg70AVWQGTnhwMXJOWAoOWVG8q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2008-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dirt","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
