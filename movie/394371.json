Janácek took Ostrovsky's tumultuous drama of infidelity , The Storm, and created a compelling piece in which his music heightens the relationship between the troubled landscape of Kát'a's inner mind and the elements doing battle outside.  In 1988, this Glyndebourne Festival production successfully distilled the heroine's wretched journey from put-upon wife and daughter-in-law to suicide via the ecstasy of a forbidden love affair into 100 minutes of intensely emotional operatic drama.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kát'a Kabanová","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
