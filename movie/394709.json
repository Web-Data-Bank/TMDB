Language preservation initiatives and mining opposition evoke emotional tones as the story swells with ravishing images of wilderness as a rough and untamed beauty. A thoughtful shift from Wild’s traditional narrative style of radical point of view documentary, \"KONELĪNE\" is a meditation on nature, culture, and economy as experienced by those who live and work on the land.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"KONELĪNE: our land beautiful","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
