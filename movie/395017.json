Scavenging insects swarm over the remaining bones and horns.  While this film focuses primarily on the griffin vulture (“nature’s undertaker”), it considers the role of all scavengers in this harsh ecosystem. Generally despised as harbingers of death, they actually help maintain the health of the savannah by disposing of waste and returning nutrients to the soil.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wings Over the Serengeti","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
