Initially acclaimed, then forgotten, and now rediscovered, the adventure of this hundred-year-old theory has marked the scientific history of the 20th century. From its inception, a mathematical difficulty arose that could have nipped the theory in the bud: the Schwarzschild singularity. In the company of great international relativistic physicists, the viewer embarks on a discovery of this theory with a singular destiny. We discover a \"curved\" universe that proves to be even stranger than Einstein had envisioned, and harbours some objects - such as black holes - that still challenge today's scientists.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/2VP4M7bmxuk0lkACuKGDJGjfOAi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76116,"logo_path":null,"name":"Institut Lagrange de Paris","origin_country":""},{"id":76117,"logo_path":"/6GBfBiE0nz6kgkNdTku3ls8ZYii.png","name":"Look at Sciences","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":76118,"logo_path":null,"name":"Institut Henri Poincaré","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2015-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Einstein et la Relativité Générale, une histoire singulière","video":false,"vote_average":7.167,"vote_count":6}
