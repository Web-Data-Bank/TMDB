Seeking the right to be treated as political prisoners rather than common criminals, Irish Republicans led by Bobby Sands began a prison hunger strike that would draw international attention to the conflict. In the 66 days that he refused food, Sands would be elected to the British Parliament, put the Irish Republican struggle centre stage on the world news agenda, and pay the ultimate price for his political convictions. The film combines a powerful mosaic of archival materials, reconstructions and the illuminating accounts of former prisoners, commentators and key players in the drama. With Sands's evocative prison diary at its core, the film brings fresh insight to an iconic figure who single-handedly created a transformative moment in Ireland's history that had global aftershocks.","popularity":1.273,"poster_path":"/25kLxS6AFsQMOBqG5dRK8Mwcz2c.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80995,"logo_path":"/awknjEFU2v2qRKAOe1MZkaMDYN2.png","name":"Fine Point Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2016-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bobby Sands: 66 Days","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":14}
