While his devoted father and mother were exiled to Hawaii, seven-year-old Joseph was left alone for several years to mature. A historian for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints at age 25, Joseph defended the faith as a scholar and prolific writer over the next 70 years. Through his lifelong commitment as theologian, apostle, and Prophet of God, he helped the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints grow to be a worldwide religion.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tKqwy3BF8iyBsofLTO3sAUZwNHN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":66939,"logo_path":null,"name":"Trek West, Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Defender of Truth","title":"Joseph Fielding Smith: The Modern Prophets","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
