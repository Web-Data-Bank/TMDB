From Billions to None retells the remarkable story of the passenger pigeon and explores its striking relevance to conservation challenges today, and plans for its possible revival. Interweaving rare archival material, CGI animation that brings the flocks of millions to life and aerial cinematography, the film recreates the awe-inspiring nature of these birds, and presents passionate scientists, teachers and young people who reveal why, 100 years later, it's important to remember the event - and act.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xGjOGXoLtBPhZdfzmoZEeKIAMiA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From Billions to None: The Passenger Pigeon's Flight to Extinction","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
