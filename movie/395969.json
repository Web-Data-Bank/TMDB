She grew up in Auckland’s Glen Innes in a home beset by alcoholism, abuse and violence. When she left home at 15, Donna found herself pregnant and, just like her mother, caught up in a violent relationship. She turned to alcohol to hide the pain. But Donna’s mother had instilled in her daughter a profound love for music — and it was this, along with Donna’s willpower and determination, that would eventually give her a way out of the darkness — escaping a cycle of violence and addiction to become a successful and much-loved songwriter. The film follows Donna and her band on their recent tour of the United States, then finally brings her home to confront her past.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sound of Her Guitar","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
