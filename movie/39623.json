The story starts when Jane Dancer is mugged and knocked unconscious on her way home late one night. She wakes up on a park bench with complete amnesia (and a horny stranger by her side). Confused and lost, she succums to the stranger and begins a sordid jaunt through Budapest's sleazy and depraved night life, searching for clues to who (and what) she is. Her journey for answers leads to a sexual awakening, creating a series of scorching sexual encounters in public parks, at a fire station, in a warehouse, in a restaurant, and a strip club filled with sexy strippers and horny men. Leading the cast of over twenty girls is sensational newcomer Ivy Crystal (as Jane Dancer), a stunning doe-eyed brunette and native Hungarian that is surely destined for stardom.","popularity":1.491,"poster_path":"/olqARFP8P4udMa7gE8jcL9TrNxI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5788,"logo_path":"/yinfjn2frssMZuW2DNVH1QwJBZv.png","name":"Private","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-08-17","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Private Dancer","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
