Long before that Doctor Bartolo took responsibility for Omar, an 18-year-old Tunisian who stranded on Lampedusa's coast. Dr Bartolo offers Omar a family, a home and a job as an interpreter in the local detention centre. Around the same time also Adam, a 16-year-old from Ghana, is taken in by a hotelkeeper, who gives him a job as the hotel's valet. Both boys have been lucky. Or haven't they? Because a future is more than a roof above your head. And good intentions don't suffice for true integration. We should at least listen to the boys themselves. Lampedusa: promised land or prison in the Mediterranean Sea? These 2 unique adoption stories reveal the search for freedom and happiness of both the Lampedusiani and the newcomers, and are a metaphor for the task that awaits the European continent.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mFhEVydfwBhiUCSASgbyWqD9bK8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Man Is an Island","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
