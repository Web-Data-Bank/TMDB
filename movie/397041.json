But he must face some temptations.  In the world in which illusion gets the right to dimension, matters have no gravitation, they are fragile and at the same time constant. Where the corporeal burdens the consciousness, consciously silent, with thirst and wish for penetration into a totally different reality - the images become one, first of all-important element, while they are discreetly thread towards eternity. This is a world in which the only magic is implied.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/I1WJ8TLioc3fWzjrk0v8nuHh92.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":65034,"logo_path":null,"name":"Makedonska Televizija","origin_country":"MK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","name":"Macedonia"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2002-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Macedonian","iso_639_1":"mk","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Judge","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
