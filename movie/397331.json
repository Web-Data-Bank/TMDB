My guess is that if one knows what he or she is looking at before seeing this little film, half of its excitement and a good deal of its meaning disappears. Seen in total innocence, though (and maybe I’m exaggerating the importance of this), SKY BLUE WATER is a wonder. With Gottheim’s Blues and Frampton’s Lemon (for Robert Hunt), it is one of the happiest, most uplifting short films I’ve ever seen.” – Scott MacDonald, Idiolects\" -- Scott MacDonald, Idiolects","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iw9u7FVL3aTxt1li0mitSAYKtXG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1972-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sky Blue Water Light Sign","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
