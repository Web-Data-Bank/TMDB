His incredible live performances, such as the one captured here at the Forum in Los Angeles, have made him a star across the globe, from Las Vegas to the London Palladium.  Few can equal the passion and commitment delivered by Humperdinck. The comparisons are drawn only with the very best - Elvis, Tony Bennett, Tom Jones, but Humperdinck with his distinctive style, sense of humour and genuine affection for his audience shows he is more than worthy of such rarefied status.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":8273,"logo_path":"/pXZ6qUs6bZUsS5zsRXrojW9aZ1f.png","name":"Eagle Rock Entertainment","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2003-07-29","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Engelbert Live","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
