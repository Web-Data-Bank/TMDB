This remarkable ability causes her much suffering, for upon reaching adolescence, she is diagnosed as mad on account of seeing people who are not there. Only later does she find a way to cultivate her gifts within the spiritualist movement.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shadowland or Light from the Other Side","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
