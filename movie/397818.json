With a calculated indifference to craft, Burns celebrates himself in a portrait of the artist as a post-conceptual composite of Alfred Jarry and Ralph Nader. WHY CARS? details Burns’ strenuously bizarre campaign to establish pedestrian crosswalks in his Australian hometown, then follows the extension of his work across the globe to TriBeCa. […] [WHY CARS?] is an aggressive jumble of car wrecks, TV (interviews), scenes from loft life, and some Chinese propaganda shot off of the screen at Film Forum.” –J.
