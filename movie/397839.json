STAGE DANCERS: Grand and graceful gypsies — polished performers who are passionate about their art and the theater.  When the choreographer of a troubled Broadway-bound musical brings the two groups together to energize his show, the results are less than successful. The professional dancers rebel when the street-wise breakers invade their turf — the theater. Tempers explode and the opening of the show is threatened.  The exciting dance sequences, including the grand finale, were choreographed by Beat Street's Lester Wilson.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ih2wQ54QFyH3XCHZjMTIzeqNT1r.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2,"logo_path":"/wdrCwmRnLFJhEoH8GSfymY85KHT.png","name":"Walt Disney Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Breakin' Through","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
