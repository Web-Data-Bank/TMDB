Modern-day scenes are accompanied by a voice-over narrating a man’s recollections of his youth. “As soon as I close my eyes,” he explains, “I go back to the past, to the moment when I made the choice that shaped my entire life.” Speaking in the Plautdietsch language, he talks calmly of the strong curiosity he felt as a young boy about the world beyond Salamanca and the Mennonite faith – a curiosity for which he paid dearly.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/eWW8ZSjvIto4s4oORzfhwWJ96BN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102895,"logo_path":"/l7vxt0fHlxH0mgPScm1a2Sv4ZZS.png","name":"Stereotactic","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2015-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Salamanca","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":3}
