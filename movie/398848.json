Acconci turns on a reel-to-reel audiotape recorder and bends down to the speaker to listen to it, his face barely visible in the frame. The audio is a recording of his own voice addressing himself and the viewer, recounting intimate details about his life. However, whenever the material becomes too personal, he tries to drown out his voice and prevent the viewer from hearing, yelling: \"No, no, no, don't tell this, don't reveal this....\" Reacting to his recorded voice, he becomes increasingly agitated as the tape proceeds.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bAfBICVGUtHzOcKqIovNtdNoIxY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Face-Off","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
