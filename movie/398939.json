Along with her sister and her friends, she dreams of becoming a dancer and revolutionising the world of hip-hop. While her friends stay in Brussels, Lila leaves everything - comfort, family - behind to go to Paris, where she is certain her persistence will pay off. Except that life in Paris quickly takes an unexpected turn. The woman who dreamed of being a choreographer ends up as a lap dancer in a rap video, and that’s only the beginning of her disillusionment. After a chance meeting with a drama teacher, she bears her heart and soul on stage and begins doing stand-up. This time, her unusual dedication leads her to find her calling. However, she still has to fight one final battle: convincing her father that she has made the right choice.","popularity":5.707,"poster_path":"/a3STZy8fib3R9aqPjHcGqMlNC1R.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92955,"logo_path":"/bGXGMxqLq7pgzNbDZrdE9Gx5ZzA.png","name":"CN6 Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":7561,"logo_path":"/yWTuzkQnp4NCS7fDVd5vzgLjoux.png","name":"Nexus Factory","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":85237,"logo_path":"/ddnvmEV5SqUxlglHCn6p9l5bjhX.png","name":"LGM Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":581,"logo_path":"/pzJLNyKypqwAgLR4OjmaxA5WEjm.png","name":"UGC","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":96790,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dum Dum Films","origin_country":""},{"id":83,"logo_path":"/9OQ0rm55xtlgX7KcAKMUePJSrQc.png","name":"France 2 Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"C'est tout pour moi","video":false,"vote_average":6.583,"vote_count":175}
