This event suffered a major hit only three days before it happened, as it was announced that Jones was pulled out by USADA due to a potential Anti-Doping Policy violation stemming from an out-of-competition sample collection on June 16. Cormier declared he would still fight if an opponent brought to him \"made sense\". It was announced that former UFC Middleweight Champion Anderson Silva would replace Jones on less than two days' notice and face Cormier in a three-round non-title light heavyweight bout. Due to those major changes, the already scheduled UFC Women's Bantamweight Championship bout between then champion Miesha Tate and top contender Amanda Nunes was revealed as the new main event.","popularity":3.535,"poster_path":"/AsCLzbzO5DZETBoGzRedEKcslQa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20529,"logo_path":"/5VmtlWl6dbREk3BWjtN7BoW73ot.png","name":"Zuffa","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-07-09","revenue":10700000,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It's time!","title":"UFC 200: Tate vs. Nunes","video":true,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":11}
