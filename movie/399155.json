It was installed at the Institute of Contemporary Art in Philadelphia in 1991. A computer is swaddled in blankets in a small baby carriage. A text appears on the screen that tells the (true) story of a woman who miscarries and keeps the fetus in her refrigerator. The narration is artificial, generated by a speech synthesis program. This voice becomes more human as the story evolves and as our understanding of the power of naming sharpens.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/m2aXMH5EO2E1NucCG88nrVbUY36.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Genesis","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
