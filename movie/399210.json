As the film progresses the darkness is interrupted by light or a light. A random sequence of lights ensues - theatre lights, streetlights, household lights, the lit end of a cigarette.

Nothing happens.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oh Joan, No","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
