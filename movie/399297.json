The search begins, with both love and exorcism. With the help of a girlfriend who now lives far away but keeps him company in her own way, he tries to find him in parties and similar situations to that of their first encounter. But none of this is actually what it seems. Disco Limbo plants its flag on common fiction grounds and creates its own language, made of mountain settings, dubbed voices, animated topographies, tutorials, video games, deserts, karaoke, and endless parties. The result is a journey in which time and space aren’t necessary companions, and where there’s so much distance between words and pictures as it exists between the boy who is searching and the one who –we can conclude– is escaping.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fIukWjIq6LiwNoL5fB2IVOufquI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2016-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Disco Limbo","video":false,"vote_average":3.7,"vote_count":6}
