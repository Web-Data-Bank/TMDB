As she often does, Moulton scrambles the lexicons of new age spirituality with fitness and beauty fads to comment on mankind's desperate need to put its faith in something. Of course, these shorts—garishly colorful, freewheeling in their use of disparate cultural signifiers—succeed on the level of spectacle. Much of the work here strives for more than flashy visuals, but, in this case, that flash feels very substantial.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mountain Where Everything Is Upside Down","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
