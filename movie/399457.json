You may have seen parts of this video already: You know, the one with Shaun and Parks dressed up like Beastie Boys'-style undercover cops a la \"Sabotage\" video. Well, the cops are back with more riders playing undercover including Darin, Brannan, Tara, the Heaneys and more. It almost seems as though way more time was spent making the \"cops\" scenes than actually filming the riding.  Shot entirely on 16-mm film, Shaft has a smooth, fluid look. It was filmed on location in Oregon, northern California and Florida, providing a variety of backdrops. Although it boasts a long list of riders, it mainly features Necrason, Murray, Shapiro, Bonifay, Lavelle, Johnson and Siebring with a cameo by Randy Harris and a nice introduction to Shawn Watson.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":77379,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bump Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shaft - A Wakeboarding Incident","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
