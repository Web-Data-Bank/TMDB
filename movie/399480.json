Memorable moments come from Brian Grubb's wakeskating section, Parks Bonifay's always impressive wakeboarding section, and the craziest and most dangerous wakeboard stunt performed to date; the U-Haul gap where a few riders gap a road by riding on top of a huge U-Haul truck! That section alone is worth the price of buying this DVD! This gap was so nasty Kyle Schmidt tore his knee upon impact to the water after jumping off the roof of the truck!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pBxWIECCOcyNthTXxJidGii435v.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77379,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bump Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Free 4 All","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
