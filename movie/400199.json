Starring tenor Rolando Villazón in a stunning performance, this was the must have ticket of the season. Soprano Nino Machaidze, only 25 years old, burst upon the Salzburg stage with an emotionally vulnerable and vocally spectacular performance. With movie star good looks and a large, warm voice, Machaidze wowed the press and audiences alike. Tony Award winner (South Pacific) Bartlett Sher directs this production of Gounod's classic opera. With sets by Michael Yeargan and costumes by Catherine Zuber, the visually vibrant production is sure to become the benchmark. Bonus materials includes \"Salzburg Impressions--Behind the Scenes of Roméo et Juliette,\" \"Love and Death in Verona\" and Villazón giving an introduction to the opera.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/z2gIot11Em1FekrMg007z0qbnjD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10707,"logo_path":"/cxWvdB6JoV1YVNno4VCg3yceoXG.png","name":"Deutsche Grammophon","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2008-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":161,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A stellar Roméo et Juliette from Salzburg!","title":"Gounod: Romeo et Juliette","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":2}
