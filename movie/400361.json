The admiral and his crew gathered knowledge and wealth from Indochina to Africa for China's Ming empire. These voyages were the biggest naval expeditions mounted at the time. Zheng He was bigger than life and could have changed the course of history. But after the seven voyages, he and his Treasure Fleet were forgotten by China, and the world, for six hundred years. National Geographic photographer Michael Yamashita sets sail to discover why.\r To celebrate the 600th anniversary of Zheng He's maiden exploration voyage, Michael Yamashita traveled over 10,000 miles from Yunnan in China to Africa's Swahili coast taking over 40,000 pictures for the feature story on this great explorer, published in the July 2005 edition of National Geographic.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eSdcNHZODpb5VSM5nVGptKoOc86.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2005-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Treasure Fleet: The Adventures of Zheng He","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
