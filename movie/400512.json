Min Tanaka is a very distinctive personality of Japanese alternative theatre in which the mind questions the tongue and so the body becomes the tongue. Min Tanaka's dance is able to speak even to those who know nothing about Japan and Japanese art. Perhaps it is because, on their road to discovery, Min and his dancers probe deep down to the roots of the culture of all peoples, to the time when we were not yet Europeans and they were not Japanese.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2002-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Rite of Spring","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
