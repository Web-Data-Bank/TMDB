Soon after, he's smitten by Agnes, a hotel guest with a model's looks and photographers wherever she goes. When she leaves for Nice, he follows, meeting Aldo on the way. Aldo becomes his boldness coach. Pierre gets a job washing dishes where Agnes is staying, but after a week or so, she's off to Deauville, with Aldo and Pierre in pursuit. Using funds they get by selling Aldo's car, this time Pierre poses as a polo-playing jet setter. Will this win the heart of Agnes?","popularity":4.14,"poster_path":"/ydBECj4Y6MAWsRL3LYz6Ex4o7jz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1416,"logo_path":null,"name":"Albina Productions S.a.r.l.","origin_country":""},{"id":13192,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fideline Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Too Shy to Try","video":false,"vote_average":6.359,"vote_count":64}
