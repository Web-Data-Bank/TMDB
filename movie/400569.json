Through grandly composed images, rhythmic editing, and aestheticized details, the director demonstrates his admiration for the interwar avant-garde. The film is a celebration of the new, while at the same time showing a traditional way of life and calling attention to working conditions; it is a refrain-like evocation of an arid country that explores the difficult lot of Syria’s rural inhabitants.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1X438eexkG1PZfCLadacFy4XiA4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":154528,"logo_path":null,"name":"Syrian Arab Television","origin_country":"SY"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SY","name":"Syrian Arab Republic"}],"release_date":"1970-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Film-Essay on the Euphrates Dam","video":false,"vote_average":2.5,"vote_count":2}
