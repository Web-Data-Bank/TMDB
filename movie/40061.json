He immediately picks up beautiful young Julie, who has just had a fight with her married boyfriend.  He gets her back to his apartment and is preparing for a sexy weekend, when his wife suddenly returns home.  He makes up a bizarre, on-the-spot, spur-of-the-moment story that the gorgeous girl is actually his long-lost daughter.  Julie plays along, but this leads to a whole series of increasingly ridiculous lies and comical situations (such as when her real mother shows up).","popularity":6.435,"poster_path":"/wZQWKK30g29YdqiSwM1HYGV5Tug.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":876,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sara Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":92708,"logo_path":null,"name":"rené chateau","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1984-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Happy Easter","video":false,"vote_average":5.943,"vote_count":115}
