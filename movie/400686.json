A love triangle between Arturo (a Puritan), Riccardo (a Royalist) and the beautiful Elvira results in a drama of escapes, disguises and captures, during which Elvira loses her reason, before a final pardon restores her senses and unites her with her beloved Arturo.  The lead tenor role is notoriously difficult and Juan Diego Fl√≥rez shows no strain or difficulty throughout the role. Opera fans will undoubtedly be impressed with the overall production and the tenor's performance in particular.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rqYfFwj5XFfi0zuGPwcxcC0oyDQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18872,"logo_path":"/9PNdO6L1bh8ZVjIwOKjveRia3Ku.png","name":"Decca","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-06-03","revenue":0,"runtime":174,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Florez and Machaidze rule!!","title":"Bellini I Puritani","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
