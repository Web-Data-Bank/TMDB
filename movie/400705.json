An otherwise ordinary flat in London, owned by its lively but untrustworthy Nigerian Landlord, No. 2 is a room that was born bad. It attracts the wrong people, and something weird always happens there. A young and sensitive writer goaded beyond endurance by an old enemy, an actress who is the victim of a crazed, bomb-making Stalker, a late night seance which goes gruesomely wrong, and a dangerously insane assassin on a gleeful killing spree. Four examples of just how macabre and downright odd Room No. 2's history is.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/zZJCSkij8WDaIDcPoiQ6cqrtaVq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77723,"logo_path":null,"name":"Seventh Twelfth Collective, The","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In Room No 2, there's always space for one more body","title":"Dead Room","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
