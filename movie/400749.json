Robards. Upon winning the prominent position as judge, Ms. Madison finds herself walking a political tight rope with enemies all around doing what they can to cause her down fall.  Judge Madison convicts a murderer to death paving the way for her to be easily elected as the first female Governor.  As Governor she is faced with a difficult dilemma. She has the power to pardon her husband who has been convicted of a serious crime, but to do so she’d be using her office for her own personal gain. “I must find some way to realize my ideals without sacrificing my husband. I must struggle on somehow for the sake of womanhood!”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6cc3hVAmpjwHT3U1MCr0362G44f.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":45606,"logo_path":null,"name":"Plymouth Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mothers of Men","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
