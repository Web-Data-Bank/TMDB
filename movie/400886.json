However Hinako (Naomi Fujiyama) and Seiji (Ittoku Kishibe) couldn't care less. Having moved in just six months ago after the closure of their herbal medicine shop, the old couple is reluctantly putting their life back together. But when Seiji disappears, the apartment rumor mill churns: divorce, murder, dismemberment? As the story spins out of control, and a mysterious man with a parasol puts in a tall order of natural remedies, the truth turns out to be even more fantastic than gossip. Ranging from incisive comedy of errors to absurdist adventure to moving late life romance, \"The Projects\" is one of the biggest surprises of the year.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/k3BkirJqaBMOpJJBrv27DXr05lO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17829,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kino Films","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2016-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Projects","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":5}
