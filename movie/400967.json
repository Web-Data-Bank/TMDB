Soon she goes on a killing rampage in this thriller that is reminiscent of 70's Italian horror flicks. The movie also stars Jed Rowen (Black Dahlia, Ghastly Love of Johnny X, Zombie Farm) as the professor who gets beaten to death by Lizzie Borden. In the end, the only thing left to the imagination is whether everyone was murdered or did it just happen in the poor girl's imagination.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Curse of Lizzie Borden","video":false,"vote_average":2.2,"vote_count":5}
