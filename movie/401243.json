Soon, she realizes that the local Kibbutz members don't seem to like strangers and foreigners, and that the evening of Yom Kippur (the most important holiday for Jews), will bring danger to her and her young volunteering friends. What begins as a time of fun and the celebration of youth turns into a menacing and bloody night of terror, which will give a new meaning to Yom Kippur of 1973.","popularity":1.096,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":77388,"logo_path":null,"name":"Globus Group","origin_country":""},{"id":75640,"logo_path":"/bcoyRFMX8ZlxkHatxpJdRcKmj4i.png","name":"White Beach Productions","origin_country":"IL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2016-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"They Just Wanted to Volunteer...","title":"Children of the Fall","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
