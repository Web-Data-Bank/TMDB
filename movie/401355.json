With unprecedented access to large-scale conventional farms, Papola asks the tough questions behind every hamburger, glass of milk and baby-back rib. What he discovers are not heartless industrialists, but America's farmers - real people who, along with him, are grappling with the moral dimensions of farming animals for food.","popularity":0.996,"poster_path":"/9wZTb0VulkiXXFVfywbSt4asgSw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":124747,"logo_path":null,"name":"Emergent Order","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Film About Husbandry and Wife","title":"At the Fork","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
