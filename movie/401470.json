The images of the colored flowers, when added to the sound of pyrotechnics, become a graphic representation of exploding buoyancy. Like in a Lewis Klahr film, the images appear to collage a story-driven narration. There is motion created by the succession of cuts, and by the hand-handled camera movements so essential to Schwartz’s style–allowing a non-aggressive, handcrafted, and detail-oriented approach to the world. Movement is more essential than any possible tale. The camera follows the shape of printed instructions, drawing verses in the air. The vivid texture and colors of these images transform the ink into trails of meaning, ways to translate inner subtleties into corporeal nature. – Monica Saviron","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oudaZBEExoOaUTdKrJHjRKA6is1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"For Them Ending","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
