Inspired by the writings of Lebanese writer Amin Maalouf, Shawky’s film trilogy explores the horrors of the medieval holy wars in the Middle-East – from an Arab perspective. With a cast made up entirely of puppets, the third part, The Secrets of Karbala (2014), centres on the period between the 7th and 12th centuries, covering the crusades as well as a dispute between two Islamic sects. Beautifully made of handblown Murano glass, the puppets have amazing expressive power, making the scenes full of violence, repression and torture all the more awe-inspiring.","popularity":0.657,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":77929,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kunstsammlung Nordrhein-Westfalen","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":77930,"logo_path":null,"name":"Qatar Museums Authority","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"QA","name":"Qatar"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"EG","name":"Egypt"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2015-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The crusades from an Arab perspective, played by puppets.","title":"Cabaret Crusades: The Secrets of Karbala","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
