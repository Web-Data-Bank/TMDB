In this musical tour-de-funk, we meet The Beasties, a clan of humans who have recently evolved from primates, and The Blesseds, a self-righteous religious sect who descended directly from Adam and Eve. When a brutal slaying provokes the Beasties to attack the Blesseds, all hell breaks loose and an unlikely romance throws a monkey wrench into the whole musical mess.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Evolution: The Musical!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
