It was the culmination of the biggest game Nell Delaney and her gang had ever undertaken. The girl, in order to land an over-cautious victim, had actually married Karl Kreidt, an unsophisticated young man, who had just come into possession of a large amount of money. He was thoroughly infatuated with the woman, could do naught but plan for her comfort, and so fell into the trap she had devised.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/534UxFZ7Axy3LkVf7NFeDg5DBIQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1282,"logo_path":null,"name":"Selig Polyscope Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When the Night Call Came","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
