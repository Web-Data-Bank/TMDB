He is the last tenant in an old house. He refuses to leave the flat in which he has passed his whole life. All appeals asking him to be 'reasonable' are of no use. And when he finally gets out his shotgun, the cops appear and use tear gas to drive him out of his flat. He is put into a straitjacket and carried out of the house as someone who's 'aggressive and always grousing'. 'The film is a bitter elegy for the unknown Vienna, seen with the eyes of an old man. A remarkable Austrian film.'","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vyTZB6We1RK3ajQiYKtwkZdg4rX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":137936,"logo_path":null,"name":"Unger/Madavi Filmproduktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1981-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dying Bit by Bit","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
