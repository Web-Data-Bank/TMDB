Zoe is understandably nervous about what the next few days have in store for her, but before long she has Asa revealing her deepest, darkest secrets for all the world to see. As the interview continues it becomes a game of cat and mouse with Zoe trying to get her story, and Asa teasing and taunting her, trying to lure the straight-laced reporter into her web and over to the dark side.
