Information is conveyed through subtitles and instead of voice-over, the soundtrack consists of period sound, usually from radio broadcasts, and brooding, disturbing jazz score by Tibor Szemz√µ. What wee see is a Jewish family first living unknowingly in the shadow of the Holocaust and then trying to cope with it still unaware of what it will finally mean. A shot of the film's photographer Max Peereboom, and his family we've come to know, cheerfully sewing and doing general preparation for a trip to a \"work camp\" when their destination was in reality the nightmare of Auschwitz adds a devastating dimension to our understanding of the Final Solution that nothing else, no Hollywood movie, no documentary, has been able to provide.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2ddJ0NGrLINdaZFaZ7XxV357clQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Family Chronicle","title":"The Maelstrom: A Family Chronicle","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1}
