Her culpability is still a subject of debate today.","popularity":1.123,"poster_path":"/2mgh9akbxvu8mf72CkLu9BNBSXd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1980-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cordélia","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":1}
