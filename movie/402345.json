By observing its quasar. As objects get pulled onto the accretion disk orbiting a supermassive black hole, friction creates a bright light known as a quasar. In this video, researchers use a “galaxy-sized lens” to analyze light from a distant quasar—revealing a supermassive black hole with a truly voracious appetite.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":54152,"logo_path":null,"name":"The American Museum of Natural History","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Distant Quasars: Shedding Light on Black Holes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
