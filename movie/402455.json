Risking their own lives, local villagers are able to rescue 69 Turkish sailors. Although being very poor and having hardly to eat, the villagers share what little they have with strangers from a country 9,000 kilometers away. 95 years later, during the Iran-Iraq War, more than 300 Japanese are stranded in Tehran. In the morning of 19 March 1985 a Turkish Airlines aircraft takes off for Tehran to evacuate the Japanese. But the remaining Turks at Tehran Mehrabad Airport still need to be convinced that they won't be able to board their own country's rescue flight.","popularity":3.038,"poster_path":"/u1hcwZFFKfA1hLqM7HWWEeyUuHh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5822,"logo_path":"/qyTbRgCyU9NLKvKaiQVbadtr7RY.png","name":"Toei Company","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":119549,"logo_path":null,"name":"Creators' Union","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":15269,"logo_path":null,"name":"Böcek Yapım","origin_country":"TR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"2015-12-05","revenue":8596000,"runtime":132,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Story of Friendship and Compassion","title":"125 Years Memory","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":24}
