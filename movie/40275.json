Lifting the genre to historic new heights! Two spacecraft - one American, the other Russian are launched simultaneously. Both believe they are on a common mission: to dock and travel together through space. Their ultimate desination is the seventh planet from the sun, Uranus. With an entire galaxy as their laboratory, the largely female Russian team's secret mission is to learn how the absence of gravity affects human sexuality: male sperm production and female reaction. Before reaching Uranus, an explosive zero-gravity orgy launches bodies and love juices to float gracefully around the space capsule. The historic sex scenes were shot in a special aircraft, flying into an altitude of 35,000 feet, then diving quickly and turning upward again. Precisely the technique used in APOLLO 13. Zero gravity is achieved for about 25-30 seconds and is repeated a couple of times in order to capture all the adventurous action.","popularity":4.636,"poster_path":"/293HMIQNS1qbQf6dwGT8TFrCFYl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5788,"logo_path":"/yinfjn2frssMZuW2DNVH1QwJBZv.png","name":"Private","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1999-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":151,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Uranus Experiment","video":false,"vote_average":8.8,"vote_count":5}
