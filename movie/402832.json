Little Kitty Ting Hao suffers due to social evils that ruthlessly rob her of the inalienable right to marry Chang Yang, the man she loves. Her incidental misbehaviour with Chang, which leads to the birth of a fatherless baby, does the final nailing of her coffin. Fortunately their daughter is intelligent and strong enough to be the master of circumstances and fights for her own love.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":60408,"logo_path":null,"name":"Motion Picture \u0026 General Investment Co., Ltd.","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1960-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Devotion","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
