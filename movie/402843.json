Child therapist by day and blues singer by night, Rick's charisma and talent are undeniable, yet he remains fixed within the definition of a narrow label. The film takes on appearance-based oppression and fat-shaming by examining the ways in which society treats people whose bodies donâ€™t necessarily match a narrow, unrealistic ideal of attractiveness. Instead of losing weight, Rick gains valuable insight, transformative new friendships, and a profound sense of self-confidence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zMaSX5AIIYTk1VY6arOenlzaQiB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fat Chance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
