In Birnbaum's vision, Fleischer's spilled inkwell releases cartoon bubbles containing images of women from MTV music videos. With wit and panache, Birnbaum reverses the traditional sexual roles of the producer and product of commercial imagery: The final image is that of a female artist on whose video \"palette\" we see a glimpse of Fleischer.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wFb4q2N1Snw46Qgzh4a5vmvu3SM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1987-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Artbreak, MTV Networks, Inc.","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
