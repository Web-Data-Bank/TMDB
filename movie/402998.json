Three weeks later, realising that something of historic significance was unfolding within the tent city the demonstrators had erected outside St Paul's Cathedral, she brought her camera along and started filming. By the time the camp was evicted in February 2012 she had accumulated hundreds of hours of footage of a contemporary grass-roots political movement in action. With humour and sensitivity, the Occupiers offers a thought-provoking, unflinching and ultimately sympathetic insight into the politics, the dramas and the conflicts of life in the protest camp that shook the City.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Occupiers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
