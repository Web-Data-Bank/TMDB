And while their battle for freedom is decades behind that of gays and lesbians, blacks or women, few doubt that the era of transgendered enfranchisement is upon us. TRANSFORMING GENDER tells this story exclusively through the voices of transgender people from all walks of life. Through a set of intimate vignettes the film opens up the world of transgender people to an audience that may have little awareness of what it means to be-fundamentally and in your deepest core-in conflict with the gender you were assigned at birth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-02-26","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Transforming Gender","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
