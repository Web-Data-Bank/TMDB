Like the earlier film, The Star Boy (1958), The Tale of the Star Boy, was based on two tales from Wilde's collection \"A House of Pomegranates\" - The Star-Child (1891) and The Birthday of the Infanta (1888) . However, the plot, in contrast to the first screen version, made more significant changes: in particular, added science-fiction elements and completely eliminated magic.","popularity":0.638,"poster_path":"/lzHxxZGUxW7sXI9fPEYXM15C6mr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12617,"logo_path":"/9Wf5DFTvzxo0pSqDp8MQWW3d01.png","name":"Belarusfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1983-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":129,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tale of the Star-Child","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
