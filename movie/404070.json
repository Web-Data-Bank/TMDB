The victim of an administrative internment aimed at re-educating her after her so-called \"depraved behaviour\", Lina finds herself completely abandoned, confused and humiliated. In present day, when she is 60 years old, for the first time in her life, our brave protagonist can finally \"spill the beans\", thus freeing herself of a burden that has threatened to destroy her all these years.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/e52gZwibt7ECx7YBnQl1kZnI3WJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2016-02-21","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lina","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":6}
