Their perfect life is totally ruined in a single moment after Tom had developed sepsis. While her husband was in coma, Nicola gave birth to their second child on the other side of the same hospital. Within a matter of days, sepsis would rob Tom of both his arms and legs, and left his face severely disfigured. As an ordinary man, Tom never put himself at risk â€” he just woke up two months later in a nightmare, a face-off quadruple amputee... This incredible story of survival shows what can be overcome when love is unconditional.","popularity":3.879,"poster_path":"/ysjAdklkfNlQ7t6CCf3QwgU5oU6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":50079,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kreo Films FZ","origin_country":"AE"},{"id":54431,"logo_path":"/v4CjB3zI2xRw1UDSYjwKA8K71gT.png","name":"Genesius Pictures","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":82910,"logo_path":null,"name":"Unlimited Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":12103,"logo_path":null,"name":"Origami Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":5056,"logo_path":"/kADFcjL04xe5HGBnlLjbfhliS2a.png","name":"Head Gear Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":2451,"logo_path":"/mZJLUZ89qpPQn49UN60Do7LlYmj.png","name":"CrossDay Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2016-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Starfish","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":16}
