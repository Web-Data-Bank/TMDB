But their therapy sessions end up  revealing as much about Albert as they do about Ben in this twisted, sexual comedy.\r Filmed on location in Glasgow, \"Seat In Shadow\" is the debut feature from writer/ director Henry Coombes. The film received its world premiere at Edinburgh International Film Festival and also played Berlin International Film Festival and  BFI Flare.  This is a witty study of social mores and sexual excess where the boundaries between doctor and patient, artist and muse become increasingly blurred.","popularity":0.867,"poster_path":"/8sjcrOIkDoRqURCx3r53trTQc4t.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seat in Shadow","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":8}
