This one-off documentary uses never-before seen footage, interviews and reconstructions to tell the story of the twins’ lives from 1968 until their deaths. From their 30-day trial and Ronnie Kray’s committal to Broadmoor - following his diagnosis as insane - to operations on the outside and the twins' various marriages inside.  A number of the subjects interviewed for the documentary had first-hand dealings with the Krays, including Wilf Pine, Ronnie Kray’s business manager; Freddie Foreman, who was sentenced at the same time as the Krays for the disposal of the body of Jack ‘the hat’ McVitie; and Maureen Flanagan, a close family friend and former model who Reggie proposed to three times whilst in prison.","popularity":0.658,"poster_path":"/22auVYoKykAPGxxyVo8XqmKdReX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78731,"logo_path":null,"name":"Woodcut Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Prison Years","title":"The Krays - The Prison Years","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
