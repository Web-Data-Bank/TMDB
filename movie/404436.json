Tracing her career from pin-up girl, to New Wave model of sexual freedom, to drug-dealing granny in the film Paulette, by way of La Fiancée du Pirate and Les Stances à Sophie, this film pays tribute to her extraordinary life and artistic odyssey. Her grand-daughters, Anna, Juliette and Solène, revisit the dreams of Bernadette, in the family home in the Cevennes region where they, like her, grew up. Her close friends, Bulle Ogier and Jean-Pierre Kalfon, reminisce on their artistic and human complicity. Throughout the film, Bernadette Lafont in person, with her inimitable character actress voice, re-evokes a life in cinema marked with insolence, courage and freedom.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/a2lxZHVQAq0QYPMirx1nhnsPUgM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16452,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lapsus","origin_country":""},{"id":22642,"logo_path":"/gqFSMOsv68FkYalHrKbUvq3pGwh.png","name":"Ina","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2016-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bernadette Lafont, and God Created the Free Woman","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":4}
