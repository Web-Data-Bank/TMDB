For Wiseman and Barley, it was their first space trip. They take you on a breathtaking adventure. The film follows them during their last months of training in different locations - the NASA center in Houston, Star City near Moscow and the European Centre in Cologne - and ultimately, the launch from Kazakhstan in May 2014. During their six-month stay, the astronauts also shoot footage, giving the viewer an overall picture of what it means to be an astronaut. Zero Gravity is a unique experience full of inside information, fascinating images of space as well as a beautiful story about friendship and devotion.","popularity":0.676,"poster_path":"/jUVkaJB4dfJMz0G80s9AywbHSgr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24043,"logo_path":null,"name":"KSM GmbH","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2016-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zero Gravity: Mission in Space","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
