Inspector James Cameron, a two-fisted roughneck with his own philosophy on handling crime, heads the investigation. A group of lepers living in the Long Island wastelands have created a terror network, killing and feeding off the flesh of innocent victims. Their leader has mutated into an invulnerable monster; he intends to propagate and strengthen his stronghold. Aided by his son Jack and a couple of motorcycle freaks, food is supplied to the clan via murder. As the authorities close in on the cannibal killers, an all-out bloodbath ensues.","popularity":0.963,"poster_path":"/43UGSjvQOpABxUPnsnTFyGioB7H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42506,"logo_path":null,"name":"Happy Enterprises","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Long Island Cannibal Massacre","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":4}
