These people, who experienced the twentieth century's bloodiest war as Soviet soldiers, immigrated to Israel after the collapse of the Soviet Union and found themselves in a society that is totally indifferent to their glorious past. The film offers a close and compassionate look at the veterans' lives, fueled by complexity, pain, and an almost silent insult, alongside joy and self-deprecating humor. The feeling of living on borrowed time drives the veterans to embark on what may be their last adventure.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":78158,"logo_path":null,"name":"Yes Doco","origin_country":""},{"id":15,"logo_path":"/2GukAxjXAF3Qf4GosI6WzIgljL3.png","name":"Lama Films","origin_country":"PS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Veterans","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
