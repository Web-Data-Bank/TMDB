The episodes seem to be irrelevant to one another, yet they all focus on male powerplay, reveal the self-consciousness and moderation of the protagonist’s idiosyncrasy and depict some special aspects of the Greek male mentality. Probably Nikos Panayotopoulos’ most personal film, covering a substantial period of his generation’s years, “I’m dreaming of my friends” is based on the book by Dimitris Nollas, looks a lot like a “road movie” and features an all-male cast, as if there’s no room for women in it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fpjUQ2dg4U3JE2S9f9OyouvDY5I.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71981,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stefi Films","origin_country":"GR"},{"id":7254,"logo_path":"/x5m947rMvwJbNpoGil5W76dIJjB.png","name":"Greek Film Centre","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"1993-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":119,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Dream of My Friends","video":false,"vote_average":4.75,"vote_count":4}
