Inevitably, considering its short length, the film is necessarily very much a character study, since there is little room to develop much in the way of a plot. Luc (Jean Descanvelle) is a young man who is determined to do things his own way and consequently conflicts with everyone he meets. He doesn’t give a damn what anyone thinks, isn’t interested in any advice they might have to give and is not interested in assistance from friends or family. He is going to do things his way, and do whatever it takes to make money, which is mainly performing sexual favours for any man who is willing to pay for it.","popularity":0.62,"poster_path":"/2aCXvU9G7sK1O3XYNGMJRAukW9E.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34935,"logo_path":"/4JDPygYD7c8ZKXyD5zj9U1j3IvM.png","name":"La Femis","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1991-07-06","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life According to Luc","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
