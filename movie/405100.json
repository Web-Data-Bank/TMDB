In the late 1970s the British artist developed a pioneering concept which also changed his perspective on painting – his “joiners”. In this film, the artist himself talks about this photographic approach, a kind of Cubism-inspired photocollage which explores the space-time continuum. Hockney allows the viewer to share in the creative “joiner” process and leads us step by step into the universe of his artistic creativity.","popularity":1.376,"poster_path":"/tLquqNI0QU7k1AQgKFvkXdDqy8S.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-07-05","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"An exploration of Hockney's technique for creating photo montages or 'joiners'.","title":"David Hockney: Joiner Photographs","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
