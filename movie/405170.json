But amidst the orchards and vineyards of the Wagram region near Vienna they are thriving. This documentary shows how the small bird with the spectacular crown feathers made a comeback in the heart of Europe and how it is dealing with its neighbours: Aesculapian snakes, foxes and falcons. But it is also the story of one man's dream that came true: Manfred Eckenfellner is the Hoopoe Whisperer, and through his passion the birds found their way back to the Wagram.  Stunning photography captures the Hoopoe, which are at the top of Austriaâ€™s endangered list. This program examines the reasons for its perilous situation and the measures being put in place by one man to return the Hoopoe to a protected environment.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":78969,"logo_path":null,"name":"Austrian Television Fund","origin_country":""},{"id":78968,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kubefilm","origin_country":""},{"id":3391,"logo_path":"/t0QBs2fI3mE3HxgoH1n39bYuzNu.png","name":"ORF","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2012-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Heading into a New Adventure... the hoopoe is back!","title":"Return of the Hoopoe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
