It prompted a public debate over conditions in remand prisons and Armley in particular, where overcrowding had reached such a level that prison officers refused to admit any new inmates. Simon faced a burglary charge over the theft of a hot-water bottle from an unoccupied flat. Less a hardened criminal than an immature, gawky teenager who never fitted in, Simon's tragic death inspired writer Vincent O'Connell and director  Corin Campbell-Hill to tell his story.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1994-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Criminal","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
