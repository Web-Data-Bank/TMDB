Sergio 'Marvelous' Martinez can drop the best boxers with his lightning strikes, floor the most beautiful women with his devastating looks, and has a hard-scrabble immigrant story and work ethic that make him the hero of the Latin street. But a willingness to call it the way he sees it and speak truth to power, has left him a virtual pariah in the notorious corrupt world of professional boxing. This is story of a man fighting to fight. But the clock is ticking. It may already be too late.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8WntKKb4UuG21foahb9ONooZ9Q8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marvelous, the Film","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":8}
