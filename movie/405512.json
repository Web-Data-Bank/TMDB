Using a unique collection of his own home movies shot between 1948 and 1977 and discovered years after his death, this film presents an intriguing and intimate portrait of Peter Sellers.  A DVD was issued entitled \"Peter Sellers - As He Filmed It\" which is a 97 minute edit of this original broadcast. Not long after the 3 part documentary series was broadcast it was pulled due to \"licencing\" issues over home-movie footage used that the Sellers estate had not agreed to. The BBC lost the case I believe and thus the reason for the 97mins DVD that was then later released excising the vast majority of the rare illuminating footage.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":205,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Peter Sellers Story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
