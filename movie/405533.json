It gives a reality check to the problem, and a validation to the Cystic Fibrosis sufferers. The number of positive reactions to the film from those afflicted with Cystic Fibrosis , attests to the emotional value as such. The humor used to substantiate the suffering of the patients gives such a film a great human touch. Hail to the producers, and especially a true memorial for one of them, Robert Schmidt, who so tragically passed away last year after filming was finished. I certainly hope that any income from this film will be donated to research for Cystic Fibrosis, and the film itself could be used to further promote outreach for this purpose.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Een ingewikkeld verhaal, eenvoudig verteld","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
