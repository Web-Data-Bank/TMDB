At Leipzig’s International Mahler Festival, to mark the centenary of Mahler’s death, they performed his monumental Second Symphony in the Gewandhaus – together with two marvellous soloists and choral forces quite beyond compare. About the final movement the composer said: “The increasing tension, working up to the final climax, is so tremendous that I don’t know myself, now that it is over, how I ever came to write it.” The painting “Morgenrot” was chosen by internationally acclaimed artist Neo Rauch to feature on the cover of this release on DVD and Blu-ray.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1r8JxHgGYLlPJQ4UgGODO9R8SDg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71247,"logo_path":null,"name":"Accentus Music","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2011-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gustav Mahler - Symphony No.  2 (Riccardo Chailly, Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra)","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
