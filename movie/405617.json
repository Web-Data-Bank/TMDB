Their opponent in the game is the local rival which holds the top position and has the ambition to move to the next league, which would be secured with a victory over Zanatlija. The atmosphere is blazing hot and any silly move on the field is received by the supporters as a life-or-death event. However, although he's been keeping the goal of his team for 10 years, Batan, the hero of this story, doesn't find the result of the game all that important.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":73544,"logo_path":null,"name":"Federalna Televizija","origin_country":"BA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BA","name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"}],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bosnian","iso_639_1":"bs","name":"Bosanski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cor(n)e(r) of the Matter","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
