It has excellent writing, direction and a professional quality about it you might not normally expect--plus the film is cute as can be with a really clever story. However, given that I have seen another of Adam Bertocci's excellent short films, LOVE: THE MOVIE, I actually was expecting something special--as LOVE was a heck of a fresh and entertaining film as well. Both films, it turns out, have already received awards and I certainly am not surprised. In fact, I can't wait until Bertocci \"turns pro\" so to speak--in other words, moves to Hollywood and makes a bazillion bucks making more nice little films--but with bigger budgets. Keep an eye out for this guy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":79132,"logo_path":null,"name":"School of Communication","origin_country":""},{"id":79127,"logo_path":null,"name":"Northwestern University","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Friend Like This Only Comes Along Once In Nine Lifetimes.","title":"Pat Gets a Cat","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
