As Álfgrímur begins to encounter the minor politicians, businessmen and social-climbers of the growing town of Reykjavík he starts to question his future as a fisherman's grandson, and is increasingly fascinated by Garðar Hólm, the celebrated Icelandic \"world singer\" whose sporadic returns to Iceland encourage Álfgrímur to pursue his own personal goals of self-expression.
