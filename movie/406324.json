He immerses himself into each new idea, playing the roles of his characters before our eyes. Slowly, these fantasies begin to intersect with his own life, blurring the line between his stories' worlds and his own failing existence. Will he ever be able to figure out the story he wants to tell? A throughly entertaining character study that is reminiscent of Walter Mitty's world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/x93zKEN3HbKGlAaKjKq47QsDFT9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2014-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Resident of the Middle Floor","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":4}
