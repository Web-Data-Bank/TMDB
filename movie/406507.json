Beautiful nature views of the island on this cute program aired back in 2009. Masami does not look nature friendly at all, cleaning and carefully examining vegetables and fruit before having a bite. But she looks very cute with long hair. Asami looks like someone I would like to be friends with, she is fun and loud and not as afraid of trying new things as Masami.  Hawaii seen like this looks like paradise, especially the sunshine from the top of the mountain.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/y33KE9QEj3xo71GXLqqHV9r7Bjf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2009-12-29","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nagasawa Masami x Mizukawa Asami: Hawaii Onna Jitensha Futari Tabi","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
