Set sail for France in 'French Fried' as the evil chef, Quint, tries to turn their snail friend into a tasty entree of escargot. It's on with the show and the dance tights when Pumba has to perform with the 'Boarshoi' ballet in 'Russia Hour'. Then, it's off 'To Killimanjaro Bird' where the feathers fly when Timon and Pumbaa baby-sit a little eagle. Last stop, the U.S.A. in 'Rocky Mountain Lie'. Pumbaa makes friends with a stinkbug... that is, until Timon mistakes it for a grub and eats it!","popularity":3.794,"poster_path":"/bzoM5t4E4fn1KF2r4rQpNTwTlVV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3475,"logo_path":"/jTPNzDEn7eHmp3nEXEEtkHm6jLg.png","name":"Disney Television Animation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dining Out with Timon & Pumbaa","video":true,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":33}
