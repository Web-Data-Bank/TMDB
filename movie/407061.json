A favorite with audiences throughout the centuries, this fairy tale is a brilliant magical celebration of romance, passion and unity.  Pitting young love against the vanity of the court. It is the familiar story of exiled lovers reunited, of woodland meanderings, of mistaken identity and disguise, and of political wrongs set right.  As in all of Shakespeare's plays, this is a story rich in mythology which deals with the transformation of souls from evil to good.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jYO96ceffbDFwtGVa3N2Z2ZKXGo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12113,"logo_path":"/lwnLVleFG0sRAYBq5IObgN30r9F.png","name":"CBC","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":156,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"As You Like It","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
