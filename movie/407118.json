The six stories compiled here are indicative of the new version's competent but uneventful nature; scripting, performances, and direction (all hampered by the program's low budget) rarely live up to the plots' potential or the drama and suspense of the original series. Amanda Plummer's Emmy-winning turn as a scientist who travels 50 years into the past to commit a murder in the Season Two episode \"A Stitch in Time\" is the highlight of the disc; the rest (culled from the series' seven-season run) offer well-worn variations on time travel themes. The full-frame disc includes \"The Outer Limits Story,\" which offers talking-head interviews with executive producers Pen Densham and Mark Stern, as well as featurettes on each episode.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nka1e3sEaMQ4jCaRQ4dLcPgn2Z3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Outer Limits: The New Series - Time Travel and Infinity","video":true,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
