While subtle intense newbie, Zafar Karachiwala, as the idealistic Satya, struggles against official sloth, hypocrisy, corruption, and censorship, Konkona Sen ( National Award - Best Actress) brilliantly plays the two modern women who battle for his heart: the fun loving, ambitious fashion designer Radha and the elegant, sensitive Shanti, who works in a charity.  Adding to the chaos, is hilarious Sinia Duggal as Satya’s pushy aunt, who tries to trap him into a traditional marriage and hysterically funny Gaurav Kapur, as Satya’s cynical friend, who lives by the perverted rules of networks of power and patronage.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2004-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chai Pani Etc.","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
