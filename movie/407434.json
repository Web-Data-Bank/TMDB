Though the sisters' father Sukandar (Hassan Sanusi (id)) lives with them, he is too involved in his own work to pay them heed.  While the sisters are out with Nana's boyfriend Herman (Bambang Irawan), their grandmother tells Sukandar than she will not live to see Nunung, already aged 29, marry. He agrees to invite his colleagues to the house. When they come several days later, Nunung impresses all present with her piano-playing and singing. However, the men are all too old, and Nunung's grandmother insists that Sukandar find a younger man. Nenny, overhearing the conversation, suggests that they hold a party; this too is a failure, as Nunung takes no interest in the festivities.","popularity":0.613,"poster_path":"/irvyF9Gq5eLsF2KvnuEAcp2UMRy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79527,"logo_path":"/ecBbf5b0KNPrOjo5GZVch2dbmUf.png","name":"PT.
