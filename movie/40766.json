Meanwhile, tales of Camelot inspire Bob's noble crew of machines - Sir Lift-A-Sot, Sir Roll-A-Lot and Lady Mix-A-Lot - in their quest to get the job done. And Sir Spud-A-Lot finds a suit of armor and a fiery steed almost perfect for jousting! Back at the castle, Bob's father is a bit of a royal pain, locking himself and Bob in the dungeon and then finding himself mysteriously trapped in a maze! Finally, a medieval pageant celebrates the grand opening of the castle and a great father-son relationship.","popularity":1.617,"poster_path":"/fUEmEYqv5yHyivyb7P6E1gaOKXO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28159,"logo_path":"/vi4Y2pr4P7Yk38EjEuEm59ebaaU.png","name":"HiT Entertainment","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":105086,"logo_path":null,"name":"HOT Animation LTD","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bob the Builder: The Knights of Fix-A-Lot","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":5}
