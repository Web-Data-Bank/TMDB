Kaganof merely projected the old 1992 16mm footage onto a screen and recorded it with a digital camera in 2002.  For some reason, he opted to not use a tripod, so the camera constantly moves around throughout the short.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-07-24","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pale Blue Eyes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
