This particular production emerged from the Opernhaus Zürich in 2004. It stars Rodney Gilfry as Pelléas, Isabel Rey as Mélisande and Michael Volle as Golaud. Franz Welser-Möst conducts the Zurich Opera Orchestra; Sven-Eric Bectholf directs for the stage.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A4JHsQ9k7CYtGi2ZOsu16iNDNeP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72207,"logo_path":null,"name":"Opernhaus Zürich","origin_country":""},{"id":79627,"logo_path":null,"name":"TDK","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2004-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":161,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pelléas et Mélisande","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
