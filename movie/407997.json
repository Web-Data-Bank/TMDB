In the winter, she leaves the cold environs of Seoul and heads to Busan, eventually finding an empty house in an abandoned part of town. She starts looking for a way to make a living, but it’s difficult to find a job with no home address, no ID card, and no phone number. She ultimately does find work, but her employer takes advantage of her and ends up firing her without paying any wages. No one seems to be on her side in this harsh and abusive world.","popularity":0.705,"poster_path":"/iJL5cZnmLQYkdfWCz8JxTkFs3FZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":45370,"logo_path":null,"name":"Indiestory","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":129563,"logo_path":null,"name":"Moviengine","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2016-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Steel Flower","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
