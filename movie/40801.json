Sounds simple enough; get the money, save her life. But her underpaid, working class husband can't afford the treatment. And time is ticking away. As Sydney begins to seek out a means to save her life, she begins to question her existence and does some soul searching, only to find herself falling in love with a single mom in the neighborhood that Sydney and her family have just moved into. Sydney is then forced to choose between her religious upbringing, her husband and son, and a love that she hides, all while fighting a losing battle to save her own life.","popularity":1.24,"poster_path":"/kQCPQIlkOSz2z2WAv5GCfyOd3Ph.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Running on Empty Dreams","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":10}
