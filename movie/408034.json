The chosen setting – a night club in the centre of Berlin – creates the intimate, dark salon atmosphere in which the songs might also have been performed at the time they were written. Returning to origins in this way, the film departs from the concert atmosphere in which song-recitals are normally performed nowadays.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":79568,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arthaus Musik","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":18497,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eins54 Film GmbH","origin_country":""},{"id":7024,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sender Freies Berlin","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":34444,"logo_path":null,"name":"Schweizer Fernsehen (FS)","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2000-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dichterliebe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
