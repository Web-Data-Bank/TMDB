She braves hostile seas in the crossing to France, but once there she finds that her struggles have only just begun. With no friends, no family, and — most crucially — no immigration papers, Samia has to figure out how to make a life and a living in a foreign land. She meets a young man, Imed, and soon finds work in the employ of the elegant Leila. But her presence in Leila's middle-class household triggers a shift in its dynamics, and soon Samia is enmeshed in a web of sexual tension.","popularity":2.039,"poster_path":"/1Hz8goVTAGs6FbaKK0CbC29LJfI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TN","name":"Tunisia"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2016-02-21","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Foreign Body","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":8}
