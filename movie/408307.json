Guney himself comes across as often angry and impatient; he slaps a young actor so as to make him cry for a scene and shows about as much warmth as December in Moscow. Unfortunately, none of this contributes to garnering sympathy for his anti-military cause.","popularity":1.34,"poster_path":"/aqUEM1tbedZqMHboxP6pR6hI5Aw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-07-26","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Autour du mur","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
