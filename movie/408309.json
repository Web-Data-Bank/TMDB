Here, the protagonist named X is the personified variable in Mathematics who is suffering from schizophrenia and hence, his personality is not constant and varies. In this story, a LEAF has been considered to be a constant and X must be equal to that LEAF in order to validate language. This is an attempt to prove that Mathematics does not constitute emotions, sentiments and is comprising mere calculations; however, one's life cannot be completely manipulated.  Here, the protagonist travels through three worlds to discover himself trying to equate himself to the LEAF.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uf5j07XmEzsS0eGrngAzjD2apPA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2016-07-15","revenue":1000,"runtime":143,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When Maths become a conversation medium","title":"The Wife's Letter","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
