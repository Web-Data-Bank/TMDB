Some bad guys rob a stagecoach; one of the passengers is Alice, who finds herself stuck between the head bad guy and a cactus. Julius rides in and saves most of the passengers, but the bad guy rides off with Alice. After a short chase, he ends up battling Julius on top of a tall rock outcropping. A piece eventually breaks off, sending both of them into a boulder field. They play hide-and-seek a while. Julius then takes off his fur and sends it out as a decoy while he sneaks up behind the bad guy with a club and beats him into the ground. Alice comes up to thank him; ashamed by his nakedness, he hides behind a rock and puts his fur back on, then accepts her thanks.","popularity":0.626,"poster_path":"/65STh3fD3nhhQi8iaWFFi3MS5rl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":171657,"logo_path":null,"name":"Walt Disney Studio","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1926-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alice in the Wooly West","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":8}
