Nonetheless they are in a hurry to leave this paradise, because the tranquility was broken by an unwanted visit by former college classmate Freedgood. His time since their liberal arts' years has been marked by imprisonment, shady business associations, and drug dealing. And as we learn quickly, this has lead to the man's demise, an interested LAPD detective, and a longing for the everyday strife that seems so much more desirable than staying in their false Eden.","popularity":3.791,"poster_path":"/uwApB4CX7i5sfjQFBcKF7664pGH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":65649,"logo_path":"/tXTuZTEcYYB1hIyAAwDyhZE0f7c.png","name":"SSS Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-08-26","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Don't get in too deep.","title":"Blood in the Water","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":20}
