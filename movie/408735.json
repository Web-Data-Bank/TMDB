Scenes of magnificence regularly alternate with scenes of darkness and squalor. From sumptuous interiors, we move to a dark street, a lonely inn. The secondary figures are astutely counterpoised: the plotting courtiers against the plotting Sparafucile and Maddalena (also ambiguously tender-hearted). When Rigoletto says \"Pari siamo\", he could be expressing the motto of the whole work: the beautiful and the ugly can be equally good, equally evil.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hTtdBMQ5Gg3bhyR1qBaHkZipFn9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18872,"logo_path":"/9PNdO6L1bh8ZVjIwOKjveRia3Ku.png","name":"Decca","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1981-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Yes, the King arrives, eventually!","title":"Rigoletto","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
