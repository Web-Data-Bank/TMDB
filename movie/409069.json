The film charts two journeys, from rural South Africa under apartheid and the rolling hills of Southern California, to the starting line of the women’s 3,000 metres. It uncovers a tale of betrayal and exploitation, of the blurred lines between politics, media and sport, and of the dedication and sacrifice required to compete at the highest level. It’s a story that split governments and divided nations, but at its heart is a tale of two young women who, despite the turmoil in their lives, just wanted to run.","popularity":1.025,"poster_path":"/qz6FXPDobOutDB2bmjupjFtCxmJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121223,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hillside Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":11594,"logo_path":"/4w31g1L8zrpOuZ7s7f83qkmfOVZ.png","name":"Passion Pictures","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2016-07-29","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Afrikaans","iso_639_1":"af","name":"Afrikaans"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Two women, two lives, one collision course...","title":"The Fall","video":false,"vote_average":8.6,"vote_count":9}
