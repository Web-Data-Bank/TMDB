His hand rests on my shoulder. A blessing, a gift. Then a history of over four decades of friendship, admiration and apprenticeship. A journey into Oliveira’s cinema, his method, his way of filming and his extraordinary cinematic inventions. He lived for over a century, over a century of cinema, cinema in its entirety. For him, and for me too now, documentary and fiction films go hand in hand; it is all about cinema. So I had the audacity to film a magnificent story that Manoel loved but never filmed, one that he left behind as if his hand and eyes were close to God, or among the gods, and he was steering me.” - João Botelho","popularity":0.782,"poster_path":"/qNIQjPrnuNAp8T2m7crheoDwkc9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28195,"logo_path":"/vZZFoeY1RlQDlidjvK0rSyUTVSA.png","name":"Ar de Filmes","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2016-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cinema, Manoel de Oliveira and Me","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":5}
