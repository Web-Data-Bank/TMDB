They change their apartment on the outskirts of the city into a photo-studio to make a living, and they are very devoted to it. The two seem to live like heavenly beings without connecting to the outside world. Their only contact with the exterior is through Jacques, a loyal friend, but he also cuts himself out of any social life. The sister and the brother then take to get in touch with the world by Mrs Jean, a friend of their deceased mother with whom Elisa takes courses of singing. They live in harmony until a young man, whom Elisa falls for, eventually leaves with Eric for the USA and left her brokenhearted alone in France.","popularity":1.05,"poster_path":"/u8mRPQU41JjlTqsOMkWhzM7csA1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":41147,"logo_path":null,"name":"Forum Distribution","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jeux d'artifices","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":3}
