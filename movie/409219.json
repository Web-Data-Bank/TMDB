Everything about Brasilia was devised and designed, but not on the basis of some cold urban design concept: the plan proves to originate from 19th-century priest Don Bosco’s dream. The chaos and disorder of the adjacent construction workers' village Vila Amauri long stood in stark contrast to the grandeur and majestic regularity of Brasilia. Now the village has disappeared beneath the reservoir’s surface, the necessary order has been restored. All Still Orbit examines both these histories.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":73364,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dart Film \u0026 Video","origin_country":"RS"},{"id":83799,"logo_path":null,"name":"Flvmina Creative Production","origin_country":""},{"id":83800,"logo_path":"/qAIl2gCsGw3jnMbE6lGaHex7jie.png","name":"Restart","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"}],"release_date":"2016-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All Still Orbit","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
