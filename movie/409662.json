The 23-year-old's physical strength is his main source of self-confidence. But with personal problems beginning to mount, he loses control over his strength and commits a violent felony at a Viennese disco that lands him in court. His last chance to take his personal and occupational future into his own hands is an anti-aggression training program in which he is enrolled alongside his suspended sentence. So now, Ahmet is not only confronted with the physical challenges of his boxing career, but also pushed to the limit psychologically by confrontational exchanges with his two social workers that force him to deal with his weaknesses and inner conflicts. A challenging test that he can withstand only with difficulty.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Schattenboxer","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
