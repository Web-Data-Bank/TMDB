Saeed and Atefeh's own house has even been taken over by a Polish Jewish family, who, it transpires, are holding Farhan hostage. It is up to the couple, with the assistance of Farhan's steely grandmother, to find a way to reclaim their lost son. One of the few Iranian films to tackle the Palestinian issue from a historical perspective, this stunning piece of work from Seifollah Daad features meticulous attention to period detail and moving performances.","popularity":0.71,"poster_path":"/1o70NqzU4VQ41RlEe8x1LOfnR12.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":130696,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sina Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SY","name":"Syrian Arab Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":144,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"That Which Remains","video":false,"vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":4}
