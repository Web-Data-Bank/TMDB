Rithy Panh shows us the work done in Cambodia to connect Khmer-society to \"modern world\". Farmers, soldiers and children work for a living there and unearthen skulls and bones -their remains from PolPot-regime you can see. The fear in their mind is portrayed by Rithy Panh in this documentary. As the other work done by Rithy Panh this deals with his people. I like it very much! The movie was awarded 1999 at \"Visions du Réel\" in Nyon (Switzerland) and at \"Cinéma du Réel\" in Paris.","popularity":1.248,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KH","name":"Cambodia"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"},{"iso_3166_1":"VN","name":"Vietnam"}],"release_date":"2000-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Land of the Wandering Souls","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
