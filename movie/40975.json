No camping, no white-water rafting, no vacation at all. So it doesn't surprise anyone that the young witch is quite disgruntled when arriving at Altenberg Castle. Her roommate is a touchy unpleassant fashion victim and headmaster Quirin Bartels is so muddle-headed that he can't even remember the names of his students properly. But then Bibi makes friends with Elea, a girl wheelchair-bound since a terrible accident where she also lost her beloved parents. Now Bibi is determined to help the sensitive Elea, searching a way to heal her from her palsy legs.","popularity":5.605,"poster_path":"/lg7veUKM3VqSnu0bl8otEnDs7M4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7247,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bavaria Filmverleih- und Produktions GmbH","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2004-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":119,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bibi Blocksberg and the Secret of Blue Owls","video":false,"vote_average":6.069,"vote_count":72}
