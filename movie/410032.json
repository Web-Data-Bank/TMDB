The premise of the film - that people are bored and need something to do or perform is beside the point - there are people in Romania who will move an entire orchestra into a cave in the forest and thousands of people will arrive to watch a classical performance there.  Breathtaking and fun at the same time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The 'inner cave', through art.","title":"Romanian","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
