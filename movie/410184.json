A pig-tailed girl with tape across her nips that’s dressed like an 80s leather bar-frequenting gay man named Osso escapes prison. Skipping down a dirt road, she’s psychokinetically frozen by a boobed Grim Reaper and told to become the leader of an invisible motorcycle gang. Meanwhile, it’s hinted that earth has been struck by an asteroid, changing its overall climate to that of a desert. Weirdly, a mirror planet dubbed Arret from another dimension overlapping our own is faced with the opposite problem. As such, a Dr. Moreau attempts to raise money for a “time gate” he theorizes will open a doorway between the two worlds. That way, he and those he presumes to be super-intelligent beings can pass through it to help each other resolve their climate issues. Oh, and he secretly hopes to establish a race of super-people who don’t eat, sleep or reproduce by mating with Arret’s inhabitants.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The rabid girl from outer fields","title":"VigasioSexploitation 2","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
