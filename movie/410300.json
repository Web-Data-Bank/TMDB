Peter is an Australian motor sports phenomenon. Widely regarded as one of the most gifted drivers of his generation and an icon in Australian sports, he resisted going overseas to create a spectacularly successful careen in  the one country he wished to call home. Peter's record-breaking achievements at Australia's premier race, the Bathurst 1000, are unlikely to be surpassed. Nine wins, seven poles and 12 podiums. Peter truly is \"King Of The Mountain\". Touring car racing has always been his passion, the ultimate challenge. Taking a car originally intended for road use and pushing to the absolute limit in competition. On bitumen or dirt, Brock has proved a master of the art and it's all detailed in this documentary.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ljXEzffsiUo8iDXLvP4n3DVkG8o.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89696,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chevron Publishing","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2005-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Peter Brock The Legend: 35 Years On The Mountain","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
