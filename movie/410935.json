Through the intimate portrayal of these boys, this powerful vérité film offers a rare in-depth look at the issues facing America's rural youth and the complex relationships between generational poverty, educational equity, and race. The evocative result is an experience that encourages us to recognize the value and complexity in lives all too often ignored.","popularity":1.098,"poster_path":"/wXioy5OesJxyneW7nHOaT1tQE7D.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19886,"logo_path":null,"name":"Independent Film Producers (IFP)","origin_country":""},{"id":13042,"logo_path":"/k57hcv8sELrZCf1j33FDBNGDpF6.png","name":"Kartemquin Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":113790,"logo_path":"/tpaJr0p9DUCm4xWrdR6YwuI6TjP.png","name":"JustFilms / Ford Foundation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An intimate portrait of three African American boys coming of age in rural North Carolina","title":"Raising Bertie","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":5}
