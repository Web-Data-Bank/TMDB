A man of great charm and power, Portaluppi lived through a grandiose but tragic era with ironic detachment, as if dancing across things as he created beauty. History marches on implacably, radically transforming the arena in which the eclectic artist and his large family lived and worked.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pc01vut0o2deUnmuiSQa5acyizF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2016-08-05","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Amateur","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
