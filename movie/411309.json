Only the statue’s monumental head was completed, and we see it from all angles, close up and further away, in Nys’ grainy super 8-film. Beyond the subject’s surly, infinite gaze, life in the town’s main square takes its daily course — one that no longer corresponds with the utopian vision of Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lénine en pensant","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
