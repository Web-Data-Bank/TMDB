HAHAHAHAH. This takes you further, deeper and darker than that with officially licensed footage from Paris-Roubaix, Criterium du Dauphine and Liege-Bastogne-Liege. You’ll be up against pro cyclists like Philippe Gilbert, Fabian Cancellara, Thor Hushovd and Bradley Wiggins. A Very Dark Place is about maximum effort for shorter durations: in this case, 4:00 intervals that take you to the limit.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sufferfest - A Very Dark Place","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
