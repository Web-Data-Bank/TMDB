Instead of focusing on the object of the Wall, \"Palestine Blues\" examines the grassroots resistance movement that has sprung up against it. 'Palestine Blues' is not a 'traditional' political reportage but rather an interminable road trip across hard and liquid borders, across a terrain that is being erased as it is being traversed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bMXkrJeZCuTmQgH8ZViTOt6ZV5H.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Palestine Blues","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
