Set in a small village in eastern Cuba during the early 1980s, this poignant political drama depicts an encounter between two deeply thoughtful souls on opposite sides of a profound cultural divide. Both have experienced deep loss, and both know the damaging effects of isolation and oppression. Even so, the cavernous ideological divide separating them — the same one that has separated Cuban friends and kin for over 50 years — has until now seemed insurmountable.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pLdB12xTz1ZjGTSdo9dH6n1YRWZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10140,"logo_path":null,"name":"Producciones de la 5ta Avenida","origin_country":""},{"id":76928,"logo_path":"/vYxQmJPhzdqB91V9vaeZfaGTSHr.png","name":"Promenades Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":125085,"logo_path":"/93rUi04qyWHVwzSHAJDcozKPus9.png","name":"Igolai Producciones","origin_country":"CO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"},{"iso_3166_1":"CU","name":"Cuba"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2016-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Santa & Andres","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":10}
