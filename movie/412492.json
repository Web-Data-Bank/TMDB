In the outskirts of Rome, a new future waits for him. When he is elected president of the homeowners’ committee, he realises that he can dream of a different kind of existence. Not only for himself and his family, but for the whole suburb where he lives. This film deals with a “bandit” who, with the help of his best friend Boccione, wants to turn the indifference of the suburb into solidarity and the roads into luxuriant fields of tomatoes, becoming the bearer of a happiness he does not know how to reach. It is the story of a fragile and irrational dream: offering a future to those who do not even believe they deserve a present.","popularity":1.797,"poster_path":"/9JiwRYj4uGtVFfhhu1Fo2DAIbry.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Was a Dreamer","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":33}
