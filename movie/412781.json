In order to better understand the dance, Mangolte learned to perform it herself. Mangolte shot Brown as she performed the solo twice, and then on the third take she decided to film in slow motion: \"I shot slow motion, knowing that it would reveal the dance and the movement in a totally different context... the slow motion version permits a second look at the choreography, and the spectators can marvel at what they remember and also what they missed the first time around.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kakIkvpCnulVhdNpZcA3wApdpOw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Water Motor","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
