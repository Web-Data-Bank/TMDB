These images are from a Shakespearean speech that dates from the seventeenth century. Climate change today has twisted the seasons beyond recognition, and the Bard's words describing a 'mazed world' are more relevant now than ever before. 'The Seasons Alter' is a vivid short film that uses Shakespearean poetry in the mouths of a modern family to illustrate the most pressing environmental challenge of our time.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/j4oqVFnZYhXKqenh4M4eYhmV5nw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2002-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Seasons Alter","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
