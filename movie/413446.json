In the process he spreads vicious rumors about his running mates and uses incendiary campaign commercials to get himself elected. His campaign is derailed when he is caught-on-tape giving a bribe to a G-man posing as a mobster. His response to the \"Mobscam\" debacle is to claim he was \"conducting his own investigation\" and then fakes an 11th hour assassination on himself to engender voter sympathy.","popularity":0.62,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1976-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Selling of Vince D'Angelo","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
