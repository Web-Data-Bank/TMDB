Even when offered a job at a restaurant in Melbourne, he declines using his father as the excuse.  When tragedy strikes, the only glimmer of joy arrives in the form of Olivia, a spirited Australian chasing her dream of working in design while on a family mission in Udine. Against the stunning vineyards, rugged mountains and blue Adriatic of Friuli-Venezia Giulia, these two very different people find themselves at a crossroads that will change their lives forever.","popularity":0.671,"poster_path":"/bocfbAWC3MmqRCkGJ1c3u9RPhi8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8904,"logo_path":"/4IvWDPpPklykgC4CdlysDN3CEGv.png","name":"ideaCinema","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":95815,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mondo Studio Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2017-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Space Between","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":2}
