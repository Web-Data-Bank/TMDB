It follows one woman's footsteps through the streets of her native city, on a journey of recovery from a bad thing that happened to her exactly one year before. It's an exploration of grief, identity and the power of architecture and urbanism to shape lives, and a celebration of the power of walking and looking to make us all feel just a little bit better. With new music by Neneh Cherry, old music by Benny Andersson (of ABBA) and Franz Berwald, and images by Christopher Doyle and Mark Cousins.","popularity":2.005,"poster_path":"/ceVENAmHyfMtMyKtovHTZZvB0Ln.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82299,"logo_path":null,"name":"BofA Productions","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":3159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Migma Film","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2016-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stockholm, My Love","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":17}
