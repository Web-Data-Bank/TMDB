Includes scenes of urban and rural life, and covers the rise and flourishing of the many religious and secular economic, political, and social movements which characterized Jewish society at this time. Film is a broad survey rather than focusing on any particular sub-topic. Notable in that it deals with the vibrancy of the life of this population of 3.5 million, and not with the tragedy of its subsequent destruction.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/v6B7gwwTAIeb5ZB0mMx9tWuao39.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Image Before My Eyes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
