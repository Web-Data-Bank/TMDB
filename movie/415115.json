His reverie ends when he suddenly subdues the guard who has come to bring him his meal and in a flash, he is out and free. Various adventures await him within the town and with its people but in the end, he heads off into the jungle. He spends some time building a house and seems content to prefer the company of his radio and the animals around him to the townspeople. Then one day his sharp ears pick up a sound that could threaten his new-found life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nKA8Wn4kcDJijbqk5pXHI1pt8cJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":122806,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hitimarama Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PF","name":"French Polynesia"}],"release_date":"1980-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"},{"english_name":"Tahitian","iso_639_1":"ty","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
