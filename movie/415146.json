In his place, he convinces Friedel, a pretty music student, to travel to Venice to meet the famous tenor. In her travels, Friedel sends postcards written by Adler to his wife to prevent her from knowing his real whereabouts. When Friedel meets Volpiâ€™s attorney, she mistakes him for the singer, and they spend days together in a romantic, picturesque Italy without him revealing his true identity. After his release from prison, Adler realizes two things: firstly, Friedel has been negotiating with the wrong man, and secondly, his wife has discovered the trick with the postcards, traveled to Italy, and started a storm of her own. But when the storm has cleared and the confusions are clarified, nothing holds them back from a happy ending.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uQppbe9BRgVvevnV2EcbiUhJxL6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81220,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kiba Kinobetriebsanstalt","origin_country":""},{"id":81221,"logo_path":null,"name":"Europa-Filmverleih AG","origin_country":""},{"id":81222,"logo_path":null,"name":"Slavia-film","origin_country":"XC"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"XC","name":"Czechoslovakia"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1933-12-30","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Das Lied der Sonne","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
