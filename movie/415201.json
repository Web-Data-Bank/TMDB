Now the much-acclaimed new Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Minnesota, which opened in 2006, is displaying Nouvel's remarkable talents to an American public.  With a cantilevered lobby that extends 175 feet over the Mississippi River, the dark midnight-blue, aluminum-paneled structure has captivated the culturally conscious city and helped spur the rejuvenation of a once-industrial waterfront.  In the tour, Nouvel takes us through three distinctive theaters he designed for the Guthrie, and out onto the cantilevered deck to view the legendary river that inspired the boldly elevated design.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":55550,"logo_path":null,"name":"Checkerboard Film Foundation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jean Nouvel: Guthrie Theater","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
