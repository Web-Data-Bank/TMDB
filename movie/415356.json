At the hospital, Dr. Daviel diagnoses him with tuberculosis and imposes a long treatment, perhaps a humane ruse to prevent him from being deported. Over the course of two years, while living with the hospital staff, Maurice and eight other young boarders unforgettably experience friendship, solidarity and extraordinary courage. These are the children of luck.","popularity":2.766,"poster_path":"/aliNBheWwVBsADwAqpMW3ikzuGz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82408,"logo_path":null,"name":"Namsorg","origin_country":""},{"id":3092,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Manuel Munz","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":15433,"logo_path":"/9nnaDAbuHwbikxAV1t1BC2Z60GC.png","name":"Orange Studio","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":856,"logo_path":"/z0vTTWBhZggM09oZWSY3hbXgPKv.png","name":"Wild Bunch","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":23545,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Vérité Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2016-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Children of Chance","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":40}
