The happy couple goes to the village to meet the bride’s relatives. However, Alena’s former husband Tolya is also on the way there: he has unexpectedly decided to get his wife back. Everything turns out as a romantic rivalry, which involves – apart from Tolya and Helmut – their friends, relatives, and the other inhabitants of the village: the businessman Yerofeev who has bought a house in the neighbourhood; a lost tank-man; and even a kite – they all meddle in the events.","popularity":1.334,"poster_path":"/dikPd6nb44JqmaKaESliim0K51M.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82340,"logo_path":null,"name":"TNT","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":82341,"logo_path":"/8Zcb7qEF5rxIeT9y7xAIRDsIgNF.png","name":"Solaris Promo Production","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2016-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Groom","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":21}
