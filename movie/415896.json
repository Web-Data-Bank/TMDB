But had Iron Maiden not done what they did way back in 1976, a time when no one even knew there was an old wave, then we might never had have heard the likes of Metallica, Def Leppard or numerous other bands who were inspired enough by Maiden s independence, energy and craft to get up and form their own groups. This documentary is a fitting tribute to the band who moved Heavy Metal towards the global industry it is today, in a way no one else has even attempted. Telling their long and fascinating story from those early days when Steve Harris was a boy with a dream and a guitar, right up to their position today as universal rock superstars with more awards to their name than just about any other Rock group, this programme can t fail to delight every Maiden fan out there.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Iron Maiden: Dawn of the Damned","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
