The Dallas-born quartet took a brief hiatus after their fifth album, SATELLITE RIDES, but returned with a bang with 2004s DRAG IT UP, which garnered kudos from fans and critics alike. Here, the indomitable rockers are captured live at Hollywood's famed Troubador, energetically performing a set of nearly two dozen of their most beloved tunes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8afs3vFBbH4bimjoKKIzwkD6238.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Old 97's: Live","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
