Drawn back together by the unexpected and mysterious death of their father, they are immediately at odds until they find a girl dumped still alive in the moors. What follows is a bizarre turn of events, both beautiful and surreal, as the two brothers search for their own resolutions. At times both a love story and a tragic tale, the story is inspired by a piece in John Steinbeck's East of Eden.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Leopard","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
