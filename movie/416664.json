Modesto is a city that lies in California's Central Valley, a region devastated during America's Great Depression. Modesto's notorious South Ninth Street (\"the Nine\") is a no man's land where the rules of polite society do not apply. The people living along the Nine form a ravaged micro community whose Darwinian existence is a day to day hustle, and survival is by any means necessary.","popularity":1.221,"poster_path":"/csI2gJk8yl38j0QVycovL1DWre0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82088,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Annex, part of John McNeil Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Nine","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
