Before Crete collapsed in fire and violence, it gave birth to Europe's first civilization nearly 5,000 years ago, and boasted an advanced, prosperous Mediterranean civilization with hinged doors, flush toilets, and magnificent palaces. How did the Minoans live, and what brought this great society to such a sudden, obscure end? Modern archeology offers new insights into the everyday life in Minoan culture, and tantalizing clues about its tragic destiny.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/agSECvuZMlATCqL4xnrCAcyqGSE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Minoans","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
