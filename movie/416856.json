Kann sein, dass ich mich verspäte","overview":"In the sixties, Peter Handke was one of the first to show how the business works: the writer as angry young man and pop star of the literary scene. As soon as he was on the bestseller lists, he turned his back on the hype. For many years, he has lived and worked in his house in a Parisian suburb, more quietly and more hospitably. Peter Handke's precise, free gaze becomes perceptible in his texts, his conversations, the cosmos of his notebooks.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/b74RnFDz3jJaDzqnL9W2BLubh4o.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16844,"logo_path":"/wy2JQsrqBGhDBg8d57SGIrZtMAh.png","name":"Zero One Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2016-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Peter Handke: In the Woods, Might Be Late","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4}
