The beautiful Delphi Lawrence heads a stellar cast, including such reliables as Victor Maddern, Norman Rossington, Conrad Phillips and Reginald Hearne. The plot centers around acrobat Peter Arne, falsely accused of murder. Escaping from the authorities, Arne hides out in a rustic inn, allowing first-time director (and former cinematographer) Robert Day ample opportunity for dark, menacing shadows and sinister underlighting. The genuine murderer is revealed just seconds before the culprit's death. Stranger's Meeting was held back from release until Robert Day's \"official\" directorial debut, The Green Man, had made the rounds.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wAErLKJtUHSh0AKvbMjeWa9xaY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1957-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Strangers' Meeting","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
