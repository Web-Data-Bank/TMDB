He drifts about until he falls in with a gang of gunrunners. He wants to quit, but can't until he makes enough money to support himself and his love Diane Cilento. Just before this is possible, Cilento's ex-boyfriend blows the whistle on the crooks. Just long enough not to wear out its welcome, The Passing Stranger is a passing good little film noir.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5G4QB3sMnUrM2kUYQJykok5gMR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8183,"logo_path":null,"name":"Harlequin Productions Ltd","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1954-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Passing Stranger","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
