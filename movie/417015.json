She wants a separation, but Gustav settles for a trial separation. As Marianne indulges in being newly single, Gustaf is perplexed by the sudden turn of events and in his confusion makes a completely irrational career change: he quits his job to start writing poetry. Meanwhile, Marianne meets the artist Rodolfo, the complete opposite of Gustaf; intriguing, emotional, impulsive. And horny.","popularity":3.213,"poster_path":"/vJXrPk8NawiTXmFkeK1k83iXeUW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":327,"logo_path":"/vodjjKlAbwGeERPjrAhxZMBGPUc.png","name":"Nordisk Film Sweden","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":2801,"logo_path":"/bswb1PLLsKDUXMLgy42bZtCtIde.png","name":"Film i Väst","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":33821,"logo_path":"/fygjYD07KphyW2zrcpFxk1J2SzE.png","name":"Film Capital Stockholm","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":2802,"logo_path":"/x3cLK4hmrDxBeoD7eWbfJL2dGxP.png","name":"TV4","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":5293,"logo_path":"/jjZ5Opcd8qD5IP34ZFu2Af7DUKn.png","name":"StellaNova Film","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2016-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Love You: A Divorce Comedy","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":10}
