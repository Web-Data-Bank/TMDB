Josefina, the matriarch whose traditional skill in cooking keeps the family alive; Laura, the daughter who prefers cooking to please her customers and the man she desires; and caught in between the two is Pinay, the granddaughter who mimics Kris Aquino to get a basketball player of her own. In their small world of the kitchen that empowers and imprisons them, they cook dishes that symbolize their affection: adobo; kare-kare; dinuguan; and pansit. Each of them brings different flavors as they mix with each other and the men of their desires.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3XjkyI8HP8yUEitKbc41kJ2XmjQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81387,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sama Sama Group","origin_country":""},{"id":19781,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinema One Originals","origin_country":"PH"},{"id":81629,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alessandro Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2006-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rekados","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
