When the other ducklings are learning to fly so they can go south for the winter, Dinky lies under a shade tree sniffing the autumn air. He learns his lesson when the others fly south and he is left behind in the winter cold. But he luckily wins a free airplane-trip in a poetry contest and beats them there.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1952-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Foolish Duckling","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
