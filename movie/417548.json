There they were tortured, raped and killed without anyone caring about their fate. Famous journalists, in the 1960s and 70s, made reports denouncing the ill-treatment. None of them - as Daniela Arbex does now - could tell the whole story. Sixty thousand died. Some managed to survive. And they now tell a little about the terrifying history of the Cologne Hospital.","popularity":1.701,"poster_path":"/76muwL3vWeojBD5N2ARsgFrtXPx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":93236,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vagalume Filmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2016-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"PortuguÃªs"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brazilian Holocaust","video":false,"vote_average":8.028,"vote_count":18}
