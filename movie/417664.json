Along the way, we get an in depth character study of the man and the manic mazes of his mind, and it ain't pretty folks. Each frame is an angst-splattered canvas of urban grit and grime, seedy bums, rednecks, kinky prostitutes, and well, you get the picture.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"He might be coming to your town soon.
