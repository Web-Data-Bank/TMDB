Though UVSC is located in one of the most conservative counties in the United States, vehement opposition to Moore's visit was much greater than anticipated. Equally surprising, however, was the overwhelming support for Moore, vocalized by students and community members previously considered \"apathetic.\" Debate between Moore supporters and Moore protestors raged openly in the media and public forums. Death threats, hate mail, bribes, and lawsuits were all candidly captured on film.","popularity":1.487,"poster_path":"/v3S9N3FG7aejJDmttT5pRVFEV5l.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160791,"logo_path":null,"name":"Minority Films LLC","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Death Threats, Bribery, and Family Values.","title":"This Divided State","video":false,"vote_average":7.667,"vote_count":12}
