Cinema within cinema, like an endless Russian doll. Shot during the last Mar del Plata Film Fest, the film’s images range from close-ups of the woman giving a ghostly interview to her love flings as she goes through the city sharing her experiences. A great compilation of the things driven by the experience of watching, making, and feeling films, either from inside or outside of it, as protagonists, directors, or spectators.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mww1kwOrqcZ14RNwa8S2auH3MDB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2016-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Romántico italiano","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
