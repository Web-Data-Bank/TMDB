That sum no longer included Ramón Cáceres, who had died at the hands of his wife and brother-in-law five years before: the only crime in that town’s history. They had gotten married in secret when Cáceres was 77 and she was 33. The case was covered by the press (mainly because of the unbelievable part played by a donkey in its solving) and was later forgotten. But Distéfano didn’t. Crimen de Las Salinas transcends the news story and builds up, even though in the film it’s always daytime, the disturbing portrait of quite a few obscurities.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/g5uyx6iKYANNBlPQ1iCRblQSZeC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2016-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crimen en las salinas","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
