Here we see the meeting with Queen Isabella of Spain and her promise to fit out a fleet. The next scene gives one an idea of the Spanish galleons at sea. Months seemed to have passed and no sight of land; the sailors are very impatient and in the end mutiny. Just at this moment land is sighted, and here we get a very fine view of the \"lookout\" in the \"crow's nest.\" The next scene shows how Columbus had to fight his way with the natives, while these in the end were conquered by kindness. The next scene brings us back to Spain, where he has awakened great jealousy, and is charged with cruelty by some of his crew. Investigations are made and he is cast into prison. He sees from his cell, the great welcome Amerigo Vespucci receives, as having added a new world to the throne of Spain. The authorship of this film was also ascribed to Louis Feuillade.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pwGpY011rAnZnLbpCrhHdJ2iIOp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9,"logo_path":"/nda3dTUYdDrJ6rZqBpYvY865aDv.png","name":"Gaumont","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1910-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Christopher Columbus","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
