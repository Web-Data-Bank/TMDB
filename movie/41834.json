He sells their livestock and small plot of land in exchange for passage for two. He wants to leave their seven children in the care of the eldest and his parents; his father advises him to take one son to be educated in Europe, as economic insurance. The three set off for Istanbul, Milan, and Switzerland, stowing away on a ship. At Lake Como, they pay the rest of their money to unprincipled men who abandon them at an Alpine pass before a blizzard. Father and son are separated from Meryem. Will anyone reach the land of promise?","popularity":0.819,"poster_path":"/dbNpWp7sGGIN2Qk8v10oxvNKFfq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":181,"logo_path":"/zhQ77XOviCBuXd74IurqqjgLNe0.png","name":"Channel Four Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":850,"logo_path":"/aF7qajGJGtMpdrtvssM9g90YanX.png","name":"Eurimages","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":18161,"logo_path":null,"name":"Condor Films","origin_country":""},{"id":28391,"logo_path":null,"name":"Antea Cinematografica","origin_country":""},{"id":34444,"logo_path":null,"name":"Schweizer Fernsehen (FS)","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":75365,"logo_path":null,"name":"Catpics","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":75366,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinerent Filmequipment Service AG","origin_country":""},{"id":75367,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cineverde","origin_country":""},{"id":75368,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dewe Hellthaler","origin_country":""},{"id":75369,"logo_path":null,"name":"Département Fédéral de l'Intérieur","origin_country":""},{"id":1245,"logo_path":"/suKdkPTtHn0DzGYmrXCA506dJON.png","name":"TSR","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":42145,"logo_path":"/fX8uY3tXWh814PLVqKM0IJEoDPW.png","name":"SRF","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1990-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Journey of Hope","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":23}
