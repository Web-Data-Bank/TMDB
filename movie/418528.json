Observing, you slip from reality into a place where time has lost its linearity, looping through the odd images thrown off by a distorted reality. Images of non-existence, of varying reflections of death issuing from both past and future, concrete yet abstract, horrible yet desirable. A family asks a young psychiatrist to be their guest for a while to untangle the circumstances of their father's illness. He's developed a suicidal fixation for ropes and knots among other things. While deeply involved in analyzing the patient's delirium, the doctor begins to lose track of what is taking place. The task of \"how to help\" is twisted into \"who am I? Doctor or patient? Chance guest, member of this suffering family, or a catholic priest who has dreamed this all up?\" In order to get a handle on it all, it's best to start from the beginning, but why do things keep shifting, changing?","popularity":0.714,"poster_path":"/9X8Pa5H2BeWtNNOmIw0ygLu7MeL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":199625,"logo_path":null,"name":"MF Films (UA)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2013-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Delirium","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":4}
