Jia Tsu Thompson and Mary Mohammed spend long hours rehearsing at Mu Lan Teahouse in Halifax, where they read their lines over and over, sip tea, and recount buried stories of war. As they diligently practise together and at home, they come to have their own personal catharses. Fusing activism and performance, the film honours the thousands of girls and women from Korea, China, Japan and the Philippines who were forced into sexual slavery—into providing “comfort” to soldiers in the Imperial Japanese military during the 1930s and ’40s.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/z2z6B4j1NKpTVeBnhKmdEaTB3xu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mary & Myself","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
