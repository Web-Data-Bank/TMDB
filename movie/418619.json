All his life, this uncompromising fighter for justice and equality strived to reconcile the irreconcilable: Christian practice and international socialism. In the end, he was betrayed by both – not the ideas, but by those who saw him as the enemy or merely the means to get what they wanted. A story which indirectly reflects the present day.","popularity":1.095,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":83639,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Legen","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"2015-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Partisan Priest","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
