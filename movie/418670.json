His captors, who dub themselves The Gang of Barbarians, operate under the assumption that his Jewish heritage means he is worth a lot of money. Taking the audience through the harrowing experience of the Halimi family and sharing a searing insight into Ilan's vicious ordeal, the story tracks the massive but futile investigation doomed by near-misses and tragedy that triggered a national outcry. For 24 days the police, insistent upon handling the case as a normal for-ransom kidnapping, failed to recognize the anti-Semitic overtones of the abduction. Faithfully reenacting events from the view of the various characters, Tout, tout de suite raises troubling questions about the state of anti-Semitism and race relations in contemporary France.","popularity":1.154,"poster_path":"/e3FDf26DJOYmwKUpj2kql3LvuF0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"CI","name":"Cote D'Ivoire"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"LU","name":"Luxembourg"}],"release_date":"2016-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Everything Now","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":24}
