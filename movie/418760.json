The script for it was written by Jerzy Pilch. For the famous writer, winner of the Nike Award, this is the second encounter with this cycle: earlier he wrote the script for the excellent \"Yellow Scarf\". His collaboration with director Janusz Majewski resulted in a story full of humor and charm, treating love with a slight wink of the eye and a touch of nostalgia. Wojciech Malajkat, who also played the main role, is a great merit.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cieMF5ecQtFhLxzIeZYxfXuI8a9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":169400,"logo_path":null,"name":"Telewizja Polska - Agencja Filmowa","origin_country":""},{"id":2552,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Filmowe Perspektywa","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2007-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love in an Underground Passage","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
