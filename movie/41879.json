Jesus teaches the wronged brother to forgive and love his brother. All who follow Jesus must learn that what we own has little to do with who we are. Important ideals of stewardship and preparedness are emphasized through the parable of the House Built on Rock.","popularity":1.157,"poster_path":"/jBqzyh3HfloxMKjL33HzUtonpnm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4107,"logo_path":"/nV1eu9bqF38PufXbth8BrVltXWR.png","name":"NEST Family Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":140873,"logo_path":null,"name":"Animated Bible Stories","origin_country":""},{"id":4108,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rich Animation Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Built Upon the Rock","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
