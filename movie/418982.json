The Women Of Rockabilly – Welcome To The Club is a documentary search for the \"Female Elvis\", as we meet the women of rockabilly music and explore the \"what-if’s?\" and \"what-now’s\" of their careers. Brenda Lee, Wanda Jackson, Janis Martin and a sassy cast of lesser but no less colorful pretenders to the throne describe their trailblazing days when they were the embodiment of exuberance, sexuality and defiance in a world that wasn’t quite ready for them. A rockin’ feature documentary by Beth Harrington.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/z5l8MyKOIUYYvc4frRAGCe4ciQs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Welcome to the Club: The Women of Rockabilly","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
