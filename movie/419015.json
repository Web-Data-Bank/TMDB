That is, images intended as photography, and therefore as still images. My inclination is to animate [still images] at the very limit of technical impossibility. Scanning these rolls of figures in a state of agitation, shooting one frame at a time, I wanted to extract a film from what was not a film, where frames precisely do not exist and where the process of hand-cranking exposures was indeed equivalent to that of a movie camera, without, however, being a movie camera. Of interest to me was the collision among images dispossessed of sequence, to which the possibility of motion had been given, a motion towards a kinetic narrative, no longer a photographic one, which narrates the end of the images themselves.\" Paolo Gioli","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Il finish delle figure","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
