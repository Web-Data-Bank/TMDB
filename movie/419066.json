Riding a second-hand paddle boat, they pedal over 150km along the entire Basque coast from Hendaia (French Basque Country) to Bilbao in an attempt to rediscover their country's shoreline. However, as a paddle boat is not made for the rough Basque sea, things don't go as planned. The journey becomes a delirium with unforeseen accidents, folkloric parties, hangovers, a shaman, a funeral... Documenting the expedition of these 'sailors' on his own, the filmmaker finds himself on a parallel inner journey.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/y02kq0kAIUBIF2IxiXxoFghajUQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":132386,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lapiscina","origin_country":""},{"id":132387,"logo_path":null,"name":"Botika Producciones","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2016-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Basque","iso_639_1":"eu","name":"euskera"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pedaló","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
