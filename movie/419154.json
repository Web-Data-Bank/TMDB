The film teaches us a little about history while taking us back to the golden age of radio. The documentary interviews Mark and Vicki Allen, the show hosts while learning more about their interesting, but opposite family history. The film also highlights the historical Victory Hall, a one-hundred-year-old restored vaudeville theater on Main Street, and \"Spit &amp; Whittle\" Avenue, where Charlie (1885-1936), son of Simon Beck, had a bench the women of the town called the \"Bummer's Bench.\" The men claimed it was where important community events were discussed and decisions made. Simon's son Charlie, paralyzed at an early age, presided at the bench providing advice and wisdom to all comers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":82015,"logo_path":null,"name":"Metamora Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-11-21","revenue":1500,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"See what life's all about under the horseshoe!","title":"Life Under The Horseshoe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
