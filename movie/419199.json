McDowell was dying from AIDS-related illnesses during the production of the diary.  “An elegy for McDowell, the videowork captures Kuchar’s mournful remembrances of his long-lasting friendship with the young filmmaker. But it also has the inquisitive charm, perverse humor, and quirky candor that places Kuchar’s visual expressions in a gritty niche all their own.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sg7Uhy0BuqeQooKlpvQ7VsbJHnq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Video Album 5: The Thursday People","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
