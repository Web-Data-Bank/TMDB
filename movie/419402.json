Scientists believe they've pinpointed a cause for the loss of many of the amphibians: the chytrid fungus, which flourishes in high altitudes. Unfortunately, they don't know how to combat it. Included: an isolated forest in Panama that has yet to be touched by the fungus, thus enabling frogs to live and thrive as they have for eons.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ehImHwLK2UCfiicFTJy4S20uc0U.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frogs: The Thin Green Line","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
