With this fundamental tradition on the line, newly elected Mayor Cecco (Claudio Bisio) wants to ask the local Tunisian community to “borrow” one of their children, but there’s conflict between the two communities. Cecco enlists the help of local Islam convert Bilal (Alessandro Gassman) to cross the cultural divide… but both communities are not sure what to make of a baby Jesus that may need his nationality, and even his religion changed!","popularity":5.839,"poster_path":"/aQH5sSmieXLOmil1C6GbyNC1VAU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10102,"logo_path":"/b0g4aEM39p0PwbIiaU1Cg3ZZUAq.png","name":"Cattleya","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":155990,"logo_path":"/py9VaywwK6KVi94YwrxSKVg1gkh.png","name":"RAI Cinema","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":121145,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bartlebyfilm","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2016-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Religious Place of Worship","video":false,"vote_average":5.397,"vote_count":228}
