However, that would be a far too simplistic reading of the multiple thematic elements that tie together the narrative of 'Doctor'. The idea of caste based discrimination, violence and upper-caste hypocrisy is placed alongside the notions of generational conflict in a father-son relationship and the idea of a ever-widening generation gap especially in the historical and socio-political context of the film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1940-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":138,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Doctor","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
