The Lord of the house gives a feast in honor of the arrival of a wealthy foreign noble, whom he expects to make his son-in-law. The daughter, however, has given her heart to the son of her father's enemy. That he may be present at the festival, she surreptitiously takes her father's signet ring, throwing it to him from the window, which, of course, admits him. The father, anticipating the intrusion of his enemies, orders death to any member who enters the hall. After the festivities the unwelcome betrothal takes place and the forbidden lover braves death to see his loved one. While they are in clandestine meeting a guard is seen to enter the corridor so the girl hides her sweetheart in a secret closet, turning the key and taking it with her. Not finding the intruder, the guard imagines he was mistaken.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qafSQl1tt6enBqXyWQC85JNPJZW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1911-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heart Beats of Long Ago","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
