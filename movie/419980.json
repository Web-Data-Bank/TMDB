His salary is not large enough to support a wife and he asks his employer for a \"raise,\" which is refused. The same thing occurs several times, and with each refusal Ned postpones his marriage. In despair he concocts a scheme to make his employer give him the coveted \"raise.\" He takes a bright young maid who works at his boarding house into his confidence. Knowing that Mr. Hadley, his employer, is a flirt, and that Mrs. Hadley is extremely jealous, Ned plans to have Mary, the maid, come to Hadley's office and declare herself his (Hadley's) wife. Ned arranges it so that Mrs. Hadley arrives on the scene at the same time. A series of most laughable incidents follow Mary's entrance in Hadley's office, ending with Ned getting his \"raise.\" But the raise is such that, well, it would spoil the splendid finish of the story to tell it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1912-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How Ned Got the Raise","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":1}
