From the affection shown between father and daughter it is evident that her mother no longer survives. News reaches him of the disaster which sweeps away his entire fortune and leaves him penniless. He writes to his daughter and tells her of the great change in their affairs, and that America seems the only hope of retrieving his fortunes. In New York, we find that he has taken a very modest little apartment, to which he, months later, brings the daughter, who takes up her share of the work and does the cooking. She receives an invitation from a girl chum to attend a party, where she meets the girl's brother, with whom she falls in love. When he and his sister come to call at the little apartment they are welcomed by Monsieur, but as the old man has an engagement at the club, departs.","popularity":1.121,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1911-04-03","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Monsieur","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
