Formal portraits, bookends in this 80-year saga, enclose the central story, which opens with the baptism of Carlo, a baby in his grandfather's lap, and ends with Carlo as a grandfather with a baby in his arms. And never once do we get out of the house, whose rooms provide the film's structure. Comfort or passion? Carlo couldn't really decide until it was too late.","popularity":5.51,"poster_path":"/kq7CCOOWAEedCf2OpZ2kO6qBumq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1042,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinecittà","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":20576,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinémax","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":127,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In 1906 Carlo was born into a very large family...","title":"The Family","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":95}
