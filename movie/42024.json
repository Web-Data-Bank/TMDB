They called her Esther, for Esther Williams, she was the coxswain for their four-man rowing team, and they each loved her. They'd last seen her in 1953, when they rowed her across the Adriatic, pregnant, to join her exiled father in Italy. In flashbacks we learn the story of their youthful baptism into sex, smoking, rock and roll (Hey Ba-ba-re-bop), Hollywood and Swedish films, blue jeans on the black market, and their rivalry with Ristic, the Communist Party youth leader for whom they had instant antipathy.","popularity":2.295,"poster_path":"/xUsRFn5P4H6xnTzGUxZzFlpz16z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1531,"logo_path":null,"name":"Smart Egg Pictures","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":5940,"logo_path":null,"name":"Avala Film","origin_country":"RS"},{"id":10680,"logo_path":null,"name":"Inex film","origin_country":"YU"},{"id":15165,"logo_path":null,"name":"Centar film","origin_country":"RS"},{"id":83032,"logo_path":null,"name":"Esplendor","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"YU","name":"Yugoslavia"}],"release_date":"1985-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hey Babu Riba","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":10}
