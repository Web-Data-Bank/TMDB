Moving away from the high-tech optical printing of ‘Sappho and Jerry’ led to the hand-printing and self-processing of films that were then screened on multiple projectors onto multiple screens. ‘ORGASAMATIC’ is the most extreme of these hand-made films in that the imagery is comprised from 35mm still picture negatives that depict persons on fire, children and men I knew that burned repeated times in real life and on film.” - Bruce Posner","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1983-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Orgasamatic","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
