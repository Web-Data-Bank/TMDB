Staring directly into the camera, he first places multicolored gels on the lens, then projects slides of pure color. Exploring video's electronic color system, he points the camera at a monitor and adjusts the color switches, creating a chain reaction, a video \"hall of mirrors.\" Finally, he totally immerses his figure in saturated fields of electronic video color, his body ultimately submerged in the technology.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"R-G-B","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
