Thomsen gives an account of brief memories of childhood in a deliberately \"staged\" fashion, but more particularly of his experience of writing and on the art of reading aloud, and likewise describing poetry in general as a balance between emotion and cognition.","popularity":1.341,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-08-27","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Am Alive","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
