Senior lecturer Sarah Goode believes the most promising way to reduce the number of child-abuse cases is to encourage people to seek treatment before they target victims. Her theory is supported by an interview in this programme in which Humphries meets a man who makes an extraordinary confession on camera.","popularity":2.253,"poster_path":"/ci77KFLnZvTgrlJIOY1MtCCdEem.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84783,"logo_path":"/FgUZnTXfLk2X4AN3QXisg7lAhb.png","name":"Testimony Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Paedophile Next Door","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":6}
