Surrounded by industry visionaries from Eazy-E to Tupack Skaur, Michel'le quickly climbed the charts, but her musical successes were soon overshadowed by betrayal and corruption. A nearly decade-long romance with the infamous Dr. Dre pushed her into a life tarnished by alcohol, drugs and violence until her savior came in the unlikely form of Suge Knight, co-founder of Death Row Records and Dre's business partner. Friendship would turn into a courtly romance, but the union Michel'le thought they had did not end happily ever after. With children from both men and a career to protect, Michel'le's voice became silenced by Compton's biggest power players. Until now.","popularity":2.573,"poster_path":"/zka6iPnXLuA77wqdcdZGQaortOx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Surviving Compton: Dre, Suge and Michel'le","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":18}
