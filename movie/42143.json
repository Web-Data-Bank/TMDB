It examines the effects of the political and social upheaval of the time, and culminates in a revelrous march on the Tokyo Imperial Palace,  which turns into a massacre. Characteristically, Imamura focuses not on the leaders of the country, but on characters in the lower classes and on the fringes of society.","popularity":1.708,"poster_path":"/g82MEaenPvPkSiRGqKcFeYQHmub.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10444,"logo_path":null,"name":"Imamura Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":192,"logo_path":"/93eAKlnQecDdMtucfOprzcjMw9V.png","name":"Shochiku","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1981-01-08","revenue":0,"runtime":151,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Why Not?","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":13}
