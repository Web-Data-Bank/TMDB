Wim Wenders is working on his own film Hammett (1983) in Hollywood, but flies to New York to help Ray realize his final wish. Ray's original intent is to make a fiction film about a dying painter who sails to China to find a cure for his disease. He and Wenders discuss this idea, but it is obviously unrealistic given Ray's state of health.","popularity":1.374,"poster_path":"/dFIaPUhcHCx51kEHfwWoBBgtLg0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1980-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lightning over Water","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":22}
