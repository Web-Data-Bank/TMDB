While following the perilous and unpredictable course that will ultimately lead them home, they fall prey to visions and must confront the siren call of their own strange fantasies. With Pilots on the Way Home, Priit and Olga P채rn (Divers in the Rain) have created a new, satirical meditation on male-female relations. The film tackles masculinity and the male psyche with the same pointed sense of the absurd that has marked Priit P채rn's previous films. Pilots on the Way Home is also a journey through time and space, and to the universal sources of artistic eroticism. Olga P채rn is a master of the art of animating sand, giving Priit P채rn's unique line drawings a warm and subtle texture reminiscent of etching. Her work is perfectly matched to the impassioned beats of this tale.  - Written by NFB","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":12432,"logo_path":"/zOgIPe7TadxPBpuUsoWWSryYO6y.png","name":"Eesti Joonisfilm","origin_country":"EE"},{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"2014-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pilots on the Way Home","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
