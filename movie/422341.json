Silky, Mahima, Trisha, Durga, Kuyili, Priyanka, Vasundhara and Yamuna, under the firm protection of their guru Lakshmi Ma, deliver snippets of their marginal but sovereign existence. From a millenia-old sacred tradition to getting by every second, \"Guru\" composes with them a poem of intertwined voices in which the world is a tough playground, where the third gender is primarily the resistance force of a life shared.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/e51QJ5l9polkCDDFc2Z2ls2nylY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8471,"logo_path":"/rfmlWuH9lxt9pgQetWbNwZKSXvZ.png","name":"Tarantula","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":58666,"logo_path":null,"name":"Opening Night Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":112963,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kolam Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":19840,"logo_path":"/wMwpc8pEyLec92n33kr4Px2378D.png","name":"Wallonie Image Production","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2016-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tamil","iso_639_1":"ta","name":"தமிழ்"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guru, A Hijra Family","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
