Self-mutilation, alcohol, and childlike delusions mean Nigel is a vulnerable man. In the words of his social worker, \"Nigel has been abused financially, sexually, and emotionally for years.\" She's referring to the days when, while out \"in the wild,\" a man named Robbie took Nigel under his wings. He was like a father to Nigel, while at the same time absolutely unfit for the role of caregiver, especially because he couldn't keep his hands to himself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ds0r54af6WMNCN5omudYiua0MIS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":104220,"logo_path":null,"name":"Moving Target Films","origin_country":""},{"id":101701,"logo_path":"/uqlHSPjt2wdmDDwqd9l4jTdG779.png","name":"Dartmouth Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2011-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"66 Months","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3}
