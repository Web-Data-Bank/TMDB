Reich allows his tones to gradually shift in rhythm and melody and between the instruments. The choreography applies the same phase-shifting principle. The purely abstract movements are executed so perfectly that they seem almost mechanical and yet affect us in a strange way.","popularity":0.693,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":82718,"logo_path":null,"name":"De Munt / La Monnaie","origin_country":""},{"id":17313,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sophimages","origin_country":""},{"id":82719,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rosas","origin_country":""},{"id":82720,"logo_path":null,"name":"NPS","origin_country":""},{"id":82722,"logo_path":null,"name":"Brugge 2002","origin_country":""},{"id":94,"logo_path":"/huC7HqorvUThGIrENrbcHmQVUA0.png","name":"ARTE France Cin√©ma","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":792,"logo_path":"/cRhBQP1FFNugNxKkO1pUgeD2Rkr.png","name":"RTBF","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2002-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fase","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
