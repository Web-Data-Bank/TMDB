A year later, Minokichi meets and marries a beauty named Yuki. She bears him a daughter, Ume. 14 years pass and Ume blossoms into a radiant lady who befriends the sickly Mikio, the village leader’s son and Mosaku’s distant relative. Mikio soon dies in the same hut as Mosaku, with his body showing the same frostbite scars. Minokichi is reminded of that horrid night, and wonders what it was that he saw, and who Yuki really is.","popularity":0.685,"poster_path":"/x91e6wIHRZ5vJqHHYrdZfPg2Gs5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Snow Woman","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":6}
