For the last 2 years Tanner and his friends shredded their all-time favorite ski zones in North America and sent all the footie to long-time filmmaking collaborator Shane Nelson. (Pop Yer Bootlez! 2005, Like A Lion 2010)  Tanner and Shane spent the last 2 summers editing over 11 hours of footage down to just 38 minutes of the absolute best shots. The Ring The Alarm soundtrack features the illest underground hip-hop remixes from DJ Thomax original orchestral score by Justin Pierre &amp; Matt Taylor and Tanner's favorite dancehall tracks from Randy Valentine , Cali P and others.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/f9s1kPQl7K6U4ZBk7lxZcdYfZ2v.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11123,"logo_path":null,"name":"Inspired Media Concepts","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Ring The Alarm","title":"Ring The Alarm","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
