Maria Zechmeister was pardoned after serving 17 years in prison and lives in an isolated house at the outskirts of the village.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bkXAliYDSlteyhFvmVRyaGZeETS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18857,"logo_path":null,"name":"Neue Studio Film","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zechmeister","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
