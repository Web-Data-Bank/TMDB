Too bad she dates the most popular guy in school and doesn't have a clue that Victor exists. After a string of awkward run-ins, his chances of scoring a date with Anya seem to go from hardly any to, well, zero. But his shy and goofy charm—and an elaborate scheme to win the girl of his dreams—just might do the trick.","popularity":6.059,"poster_path":"/mdYxRQKpFQhqFBo3k87vw18m7Ov.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3675,"logo_path":null,"name":"Regner Grasten Film","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"There is a first time for everything","title":"Love at First Hiccup","video":false,"vote_average":5.418,"vote_count":61}
