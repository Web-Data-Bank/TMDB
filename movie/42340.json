On a flight to Milan Me meets Christmas, a cute, rich Hong Kong resident who immediately takes a shine to Mi. She thinks she’s hit the jackpot, but as soon as they land the two are pick-pocketed by a local. Undaunted, they go on a “poor man’s date” making the run of Milan without a penny. And the two get along famously, leading Me to the conclusion that her cynical gold-digging plans have worked.","popularity":1.019,"poster_path":"/r4YCPqlWnJCtUEpU8vpYwheMTx4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78402,"logo_path":null,"name":"SML (Hong Kong) Limited","origin_country":""},{"id":78403,"logo_path":null,"name":"Panasia Films Production Co.
