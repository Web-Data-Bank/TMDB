The carefully applied makeup and wig tell of disguise and acting, and are simultaneously beautiful and terribly stony like the anonymous woman´s head. The brevity and slow speed are reminiscent of Andy Warhol´s Screen Tests, in which every single one of the face´s movements become visible.” – Brigitta Burger-Utzer","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dp86s4bXv7Ubq2KSAWm6IpRqoHv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1967-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Self-Portrait with Head","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
