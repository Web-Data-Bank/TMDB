In this setting of intense stillness, sometimes interrupted by sudden sounds and movements in the streets, he speaks a single word, “teleftea”, meaning the last (one), and as he repeats this word, it moves differently each time across his face and gains another sense from one scene to the next, suggesting the uncanny proximity of eroticism, the sacred and chance.”\r (Robert Beavers)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3LtCxoo71eUSvl35UEUItWj2z1Y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Efpsychi","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
