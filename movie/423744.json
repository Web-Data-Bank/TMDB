The rest of the film presents luscious shots of a wooded stream and hazy glen, portrayed with the careful composition of 19th century landscape painting. An ineffable, unnameable immanence flows through the images of The Stoas, a kind of presence of the human soul expressed through the sympathetic absence of the human figure.”\r (Ed Halter, New York Press)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2UEgtpQSZ85gIfH5OlEt7r68Xm9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Stoas","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
