He looks at a photo of his girlfriend, and she razzes him. He lies down on the tracks, but the train bypasses the section of tracks that he's lying on! He jumps off a cliff, but a tree saves him. The ball bounces... we see him on the sidewalk, crying, and singing to passersby.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":8302,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fleischer Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1931-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Somebody Stole My Gal","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
