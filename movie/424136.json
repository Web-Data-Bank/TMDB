A hot- headed student protests the Dean's decision to expell a fellow student on fake accusation charges, upon which he drops out of university rather than make a compromise. He loses everything in the process: his girlfriend, housing privileges - he becomes a coal deliverer. On the job he witnesses an accident that causes death of a fellow worker. He decides to write a story, which is good and a publishing house wants to print it, but only after some corrections are made. He refuses again and the story is not printed. Finally, a story is commercialized and made into a succesful film and brings fame to the original author.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rewiuXxoo5KzhQMEOvk4z3szS4H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15568,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zespol Filmowy \"Pryzmat\"","origin_country":""},{"id":3514,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zespół Filmowy \"X\"","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1977-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Index","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":3}
