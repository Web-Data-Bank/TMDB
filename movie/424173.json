The neighborhood has been left to decay for 50 years and today, more than ever, its parts are contended by increasingly pressing economic interests. Invited by the politician on duty to imagine a different future, shemales call into play desires and fears by attending a course for caregivers. This novelty infiltrates their lives but does not change the rhythms of the particular community of San Berillo in which time is marked by the feasts dedicated to saints and Madonnas rather than the seasons. Between religious faith, love and dreams for a better future the prostitutes of San Berillo recount and claim their rights, present the intimacy of their families and their solitude in front of the door waiting for customers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/flpJ0p78l2USjeSB7W1LhhR6r2N.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jesus Died for Somebody's Sins","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":7}
