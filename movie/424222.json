Convinced that they've just witnessed a meteor landing the students follow the trajectory to document the event with their camera. In a forest area they discover a burned crater. Since it's too dark to film they decide to spend the night in their van. The next morning one of them is missing. The remaining students find first a trail of blood and then the torn up pieces of what used to be their friend. Soon they realize that something is hunting them - something that's not from this world.","popularity":1.727,"poster_path":"/2GnEKeMaO4nwv9y5ijLgoHkCYIq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":83212,"logo_path":null,"name":"Daredo Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2016-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It is here","title":"UFO: It Is Here","video":false,"vote_average":3.912,"vote_count":17}
