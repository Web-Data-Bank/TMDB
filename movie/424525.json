In her recent films, Geiser has been exploring the possibilities found in merging video texture with film, creating a lush, disorienting, ambiguous film space and an atmosphere of temporal suspension. In TERRACE 49, the space is shattered further, broken into shards: as fractured as memory and as fragile as glass.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Terrace 49","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
