The film looks at the past through historical monuments and juxtaposes these shots with scenes of daily life in the cities of Eastern Europe. It fuses the personal diary tradition with the formal concerns of conceptual cinema to vividly present the towns in Poland that Eisenberg visited, towns that offer mute testimony of the concentration camps where his family was destroyed. This is a moving and compelling self-portrait created through the vision of the present and the memory of the culture, places, and people of the past.”— John Hanhardt, Whitney Biennial Catalogue, 1989","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/446NNGV3UfGsogoEIPBkuNnPS0H.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cooperation of Parts","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
