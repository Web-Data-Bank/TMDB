Manhattan","overview":"Warhol superstar and icon of sixties bohemia Edie Sedgwick delivers her final performance in this semiautobiographical look at the price of fame. Fiction and documentary—including snippets from Sedgwick’s own audio dairies—mingle in a freewheeling portrait of Susan Superstar (Sedgwick), a New York celebrity on a drug-fueled downward slide that mirrors Sedgwick’s own self-destructive spiral. Released after her death from an overdose of barbiturates, CIAO! MANHATTAN endures as a testament to Sedgwick’s unique magnetism and as a haunting elegy for the counterculture she embodied.","popularity":2.614,"poster_path":"/j0LtzZhorCrSMpeFnROVClVd30d.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":159711,"logo_path":null,"name":"Court Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":159712,"logo_path":null,"name":"Maron Films","origin_country":""},{"id":145035,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sugarloaf Films Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1973-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ciao!
