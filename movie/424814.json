The concept is conceived in the musing: who took the photograph that washed out a frame of this film? A hybridization of mediums and tools (8mm, 16mm, optical printer) are used to investigate the camera flash that washed out a frame in the hopes of uncovering a hidden emotion. A meditation on equipoise is addressed in the guided evolvement and retraction of light on the optical printer.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Effigy in Emulsion","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
