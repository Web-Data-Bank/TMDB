We didn’t know each other, but were already intimate. His poems are full of images, I might even have dreamt some. I didn’t know anything about his personal life, about the motorcycle accident when he was sixteen, and that he spent the rest of his life in a wheelchair. There’s no trace of it in the poems: in his verses Pierluigi runs, and sometimes he flies.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/raGm7eL8WM1zTRm002sbqTefzL3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":167841,"logo_path":null,"name":"Agherose","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":20483,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tucker Film","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":175320,"logo_path":null,"name":"Centro Espressioni Cinematografiche","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2013-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Parole povere","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
