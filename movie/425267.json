They are fortunate enough to end up on a shortlist of five and receive invitations to attend an interview 10:30pm at night. They arrive at the store to meet two of the other interviewees and the manager, Anthony Parker, who locks the door on the late arrival and takes the four to the staffroom, inviting them down individually for their interviews. Then murder and mayhem begins as the applicants are stalked through the darkened supermarket warehouse by a masked murderer.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Vacancy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
