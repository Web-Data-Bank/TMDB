His work has overthrown the dominating position of the architect as well as the established link between citizens with their cities, and of man and his environment. Unlike how one conceives of an architect's apartment nowadays, Yona Friedman's space can be perceived from an erratic point of view or angle, which could be the one of his dog, Baltkis, who is the key figure of Yonas Friedman's universe. Through the exploration of a floating universe tinged with mysteries,'Film spatial' invites one to another way of perceiving the world, freed from intellectual and conceptual conformism.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Film spatial","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
