It stampedes like an angry bull through a tranquil pasture of blue violets and upright blades of grass. A tornado kills with abandon but has no will. Lynne Sachs’ TORNADO is a poetic piece shot from the perspective of Brooklyn, where much of the paper and soot from the burning towers fell on September 11. Sachs’ fingers obsessively handle these singed fragments of resumes, architectural drawings and calendars, normally banal office material that takes on a new, haunting meaning.","popularity":1.138,"poster_path":"/yVUk4AimvmvmlqHKzhvEzlUnPQY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tornado","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
