Dr. Hofbauer, a frequenter of this establishment, stages a surprise spectacle for the patrons, which serves as a pretext for an orgy. Josefine and her girls go to the country for a picnic where they encounter a hunting party of gentlemen. One of them is Herr Kirchner who tells Josefine that his good-for-nothing son Loisl is going to Vienna to learn carpentry. He sends Loisl to Josefine's house. Josefine and Annie give him a detailed lesson. Then, Loisl goes to Meister Wehringer to become his apprentice. Wehringer has an inquisitive sixteen-year-old daughter named Maria. Loisl tells her about his experiences at Josefine's house and attempts to give her a lesson himself. However, Wehringer catches them. He fires Loisl and says that he'll write to his father about his misconduct. In desperation Loisl goes to Josefine.","popularity":2.063,"poster_path":"/ePfko4CyuIdEOdRmClRhDWxiADF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Professional Janine","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
