How can one celebrate an anniversary of this sort ? By simply making \"another\" film that would sum up all the earlier ones. D'un film à l'autre is hence a kind of anthology of the films produced Les Films 13 since the 1960s (short and feature films written and directed for the main part by Claude Lelouch), a best-of of half a century of cinema, going from  Le Propre de l'homme to What Love May Bring. A biography in images of a filmmaker as admired as he is criticized. In reality, D'un film à l'autre is more than a series of film excerpts, interviews, and making-of documents (some of which possess an undeniable historical value, like that from A Man and A Woman, or the final performances of Patrick Dewaere).","popularity":0.806,"poster_path":"/rxJqOAgLxuViDP1OUp9rTcfm9kb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1742,"logo_path":"/kxKBr4UuwuVdMhuunZ579vWd5in.png","name":"Les Films 13","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2011-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"D'un film à l'autre","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":5}
