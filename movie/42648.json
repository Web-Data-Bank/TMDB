Unfortunately Billy Minsky's Burlesque is hardly the place for her Dances From The Bible. But the show's comedian Raymond sees a way of wrong-footing the local do-gooders by announcing the new Paris sensation \"Mme Fifi\" and putting on Rachel's performance as the place is raided. All too complicated, the more so since her father is scouring the town for her and both Raymond and his straight-man Chick are falling for Rachel.","popularity":3.004,"poster_path":"/cVZ0zyozUWm4YRWOqF1uYFHO8Bx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14982,"logo_path":"/cGOwFUn8Ffvo9JKfpsElS2nxPmk.png","name":"Tandem Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1968-12-22","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sometimes being a nice girl is too much to bare","title":"The Night They Raided Minsky's","video":false,"vote_average":5.441,"vote_count":17}
