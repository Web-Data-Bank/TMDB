Egoistical veteran actress Khaty is fashionably late, and shooting can`t start until she`s on set. The director is also late as his grandmother just passed away. However, right before her death, the grandmother gave the director a `saka`, a legacy-like ghost that is passed down from generation to generation within the family. During the shooting, various strange occurrences happen and Khaty gets possessed by the `saka`.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/36aK9g8MCAY5qn5DOxr7qKFhjSg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72166,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rainfilm","origin_country":"MY"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MY","name":"Malaysia"}],"release_date":"2016-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":122,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malay","iso_639_1":"ms","name":"Bahasa melayu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kecoh!
