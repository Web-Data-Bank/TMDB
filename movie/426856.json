Believing their politics and art to be absurdly different, De Antonio instead gamely proposed to drink an entire quart of J&amp;B scotch in 20 minutes under the unflinching, voyeuristic gaze of Warholâ€™s camera. Their Factory session, recorded in this film, instead lasted 66 minutes, its grand finale a reckless and grandiose De Antonio writhing on the floor, clawing the walls, and speaking in tongues.\" - MoMA","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":41698,"logo_path":null,"name":"Andy Warhol Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1965-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Drunk","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
