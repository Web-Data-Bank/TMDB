The spiral of violence and revenge is only broken when one person conquers himself and refuses to continue the vendetta. Siim, a 14-year old who grew up in the streets, is only spared the violence because he has a natural antipathy to it. Ultimately he too is caught up in the fighting when he tries to save money for his girlfriend's Christmas gift and the cash is stolen.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/taAugIAvqVFu8opFtBBOQ2yFfVr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":161919,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmistuudio See","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"1995-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Too Tired to Hate","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
