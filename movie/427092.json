In comically absurd as well as tragic episodes describing small victories and major defeats, homesickness and class distinctions, the film offers - using home movies, photographs and current professional footage - deep insights into the filmmaker's family history. It is an attempt to illustrate the balancing act between \"up here\" (Austria) and \"down there\" (Yugoslavia/Croatia) that characterizes generations of guest workers. Directed by Djordje Cenic and Hermann Peseckas.  - Written by Djordje Cenic","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2016-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Serbo-Croatian","iso_639_1":"sh","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unten","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
