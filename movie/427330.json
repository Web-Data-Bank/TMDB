A man gets off the same bus, and that very night he seizes the two women and asks for the most beautiful woman in town as their ransom. After the initial shock, the mayor, his brother, the prefect, the police, and the gendarmerie gather around the house where the two woman are imprisoned. It will be a test for everyone and each of them will show his/her real stuff: hypocrisy, meanness, or humanity concealed under their provincial respectability.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kOCAJlOsNeai7Xw67bK9Qb6qpnl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18477,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films La Boétie","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":14235,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinévidéo","origin_country":""},{"id":98398,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kangourou Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1974-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Par le sang des autres","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
