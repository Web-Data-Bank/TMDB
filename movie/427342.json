Based on the account by reporter Vasiliy Koroteev that appeared in the Red Army's newspaper, Krasnaya Zvezda, shortly after the battle, this is the story of Panifilov's Twenty-Eight, a group of twenty-eight soldiers of the Red Army's 316th Rifle Division, under the command of General Ivan Panfilov, that stopped the advance on Moscow of a column of fifty-four Nazi tanks of the 11th Panzer Division for several days. Though armed only with standard issue Mosin-Nagant infantry rifles and DP and PM-M1910 machine guns, all useless against tanks, and with wholly inadequate RPG-40 anti-tank grenades and PTRD-41 anti-tank rifles, they fight tirelessly and defiantly, with uncommon bravery and unwavering dedication, to protect Moscow and their Motherland.","popularity":12.746,"poster_path":"/L8aLFIITBjsn3HlQp0M0sT0Xe7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84834,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gaijin Entertainment","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":84835,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lybian Palette","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2016-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Panfilov's 28 Men","video":false,"vote_average":6.944,"vote_count":134}
