This encounter between a symbol of typical Swiss mentality with a penchant for order and the tenants who have been housed here by the city’s social services department is not something to be taken for granted. Although the laundry room is normally located in the cellar, the tenants in this building share a tiny laundry room off the entrance hall because the cellar is reserved for prostitution. To maintain order and cleanliness, the landlord hires Claudina, a new “laundry woman”.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/bAC7nwT1dAnm3dSAI51kL4rHkRU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53388,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alina Film","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":83682,"logo_path":"/k5z2xgQlfeEGTIUApKwGfnmdaC2.png","name":"Les Productions de l’œil sauvage","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":170038,"logo_path":null,"name":"TV Tours Val de Loire","origin_country":""},{"id":13668,"logo_path":"/azhapBvZ8g1UWyyQQhhcRR9bM9x.png","name":"RTS","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2013-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Laundry Room","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
