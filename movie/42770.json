Life is rough in Reykjavik's post-war slum of Camp Thule, where the abandoned US military barracks have been turned into makeshift homes. Struggling wives and their hard-working husbands try to make ends meet. The younger generation dreams of dollars, Rock'n'Roll and the American way of life. To celebrate or to drown their misery - they're never short of a good reason to booze. Devil's Island vividly depicts the everyday life of a wacky family, their neighbours and friends and shows how some of their dreams come true and others don't.","popularity":1.674,"poster_path":"/7z4ZGmhkfEGH0lphI3f9RoKEcLR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14937,"logo_path":null,"name":"Íslenska kvikmyndasamsteypan","origin_country":"IS"},{"id":76,"logo_path":"/nebkQYtQKhZyHJfh5v0oGpNbPzu.png","name":"Zentropa Entertainments","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":166,"logo_path":null,"name":"Peter Rommel Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":136563,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmhuset AS","origin_country":""},{"id":11237,"logo_path":"/nzPEges9ftjCDQWru0qrIfTX8OR.png","name":"ZDF/Arte","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"1996-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Devil's Island","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":7}
