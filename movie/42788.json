Fabrizio is passionate, idealistic, influenced by Cesare, a teacher and Marxist, engaged to the lovely but bourgeois Clelia, and stung by the drowning of his mercurial friend Agostino, a possible suicide. Gina is herself a bundle of nervous energy, alternately sweet, seductive, poetic, distracted, and unhinged. They begin a love affair after Agostino's funeral, then Gina confuses Fabrizio by sleeping with a stranger. Their visits to Cesare and then to Puck, one of Gina's older friends, a landowner losing his land, dramatize contrasting images of Italy's future. Their own futures are bleak.","popularity":4.59,"poster_path":"/eonuTTUGbxVurkBgC1KLJ00QIvR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":54425,"logo_path":null,"name":"Iride Cinematografica","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1964-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Italy is the place where they've made an art of everything - especially love!","title":"Before the Revolution","video":false,"vote_average":7.108,"vote_count":93}
