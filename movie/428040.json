That is until the four brothers join forces against a common adversary--the Hagbarts, the meanest bullies at their middle school. But now Mom has decided that the Buckley family is going to Elve the Hagbarts this year for Christmas. Eleven-year-old Matthew can hardly stand it. By day the Hagbarts torture the Buckley brothers into submission, and by night the Buckleys secretly deliver Christmas treats and gifts to their sworn enemies. Soon the war of wits escalates to an incredible scheme designed to get the ultimate revenge on the Hagbarts. But now that Matthew has been learning that he's supposed to be good to those who hate him, what will he do when a little push becomes a great big shove?","popularity":1.077,"poster_path":"/8G4IrrLt4YRY4hhPTW76XGSCYm6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Christmas Project","video":false,"vote_average":4.833,"vote_count":12}
