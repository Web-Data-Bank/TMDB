Structured in six segments, this technical tour-de-force is a pyrotechnic fusion of sound and image, in which the dynamic visual imagery fully complements and heightens Sakamoto's staccato, percussive score. Fitzgerald and Garrin merge terrestrial and interplanetary worlds, in which Sakamoto's figure becomes an integral part of the landscape. Set aloft in the surreal world of the artists' invention, Sakamoto dances, floats and walks through a hyperkinetic universe.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/koeIMcaQUtXyD4qTujctbKzLAzU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Adelic Penguins","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
