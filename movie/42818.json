Colorful characters abound: M. Panisse, an aging widower and prosperous sail maker; Honorine, a fishmonger with a sidewalk stall near the bar; her daughter, Fanny, who helps her sell cockles just outside the bar; and various old salts. Friends since childhood, Fanny and Marius love each other, but Marius has a secret wanderlust: every ship's whistle stirs a longing for foreign lands. When M. Panisse seeks Fanny's hand in marriage and when a departing clipper needs a deckhand, Marius and Fanny must decide who and what they love most. César, with his generous, wise spirit, tries to guide his son.","popularity":4.47,"poster_path":"/1dpo4ZJ4Sdv9XEUKNRGXvO6gp87.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27647,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Paramount","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1931-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":121,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marius","video":false,"vote_average":7.18,"vote_count":64}
