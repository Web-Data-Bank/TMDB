It is considered Lubitsch's first directorial work and is one of the director's lost works. With the outbreak of World War I , all the men, including the barbers , are drafted. As a result, the women have to take over their work, and so mother and daughter share the work in a barber's shop: the daughter soaps the customers, while the mother then more or less skilfully shaves the men. A customer named Ernst also wants to be shaved. He makes eyes at the daughter and is resolutely thrown out of the shop by his mother. Ernst flees with his great love in the car and is followed by his mother on foot and finally on a tricycle.","popularity":0.655,"poster_path":"/bAdfXtzTvTx11xvDkCfaPfZ1MnP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12950,"logo_path":null,"name":"Projektions-AG Union (PAGU)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1915-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Miss Soapsuds","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
