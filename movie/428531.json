What seems at first to be a quiet arrangement of a dead hare and peach on a table starts to decompose before our eyes. Rather than attempting to capture a moment in time, the viewer is put face to face with a speeded up decomposition of the subject matter. Taylor-Wood brings home the transience of biological life, and the viewer's mortality. This work explores the issue of temporality, an idea which permeates the artist's oeuvre, where a course of action can change radically even within the space of a few seconds.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Little Death","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
