The person inflicting her agony is also unheard and unseen, but has a tangible presence in the film.

The tangible melts into the intangible and the other way around.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uX5gxaBGz5N04fycVoS5Xj7HKH4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2001-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Breach (Girl & Eunuch)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
