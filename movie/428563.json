The poem has got just about everything - it is an action-packed adventure, a ghost story, a steamy romance, a morality tale and the world's first eco-poem.  Armitage follows in the footsteps of the poem's hero, Gawain, through some of Britain's most beautiful and mystical landscapes and reveals why an absurd tale of a knight beheading a green giant is as relevant and compelling today as when it was written.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eu0guJKq3estpfy3WmpguKiJ43S.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"BBC Four Presents: Sir Gawain and the Green Knight","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
