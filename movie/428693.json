This domestic drama is enacted simultaneously on two separate projected screens—the man’s space is described by a chair standing against a blank wall, the woman’s by a fridge and a fragment of kitchen sideboard. Each participant is isolated within his and her own screen, the borders from one to the other being crossed by thrown objects such as a glass of milk or a frying pan and, occasionally, by one of the participants, who, unable to contain their rage, launches an attack across the divide. A soundtrack of tuning into a series of different radio stations accompanies the film, seeming to articulate the switching emotional tenor of the scenario as it moves through confusion, anger, sadness and resignation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/z1nuPMzkDzPsIcliyhCEGH65EI1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Travesty of a Mockery","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
