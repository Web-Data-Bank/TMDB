The characters are described with realism, with their contradictions, their desperation, the temptation of an escape, but the cornerstone of the movie is the sincerity of the positive feelings of each and everyone of them: the love of a father for his son, the love for a woman, for friends, and most of all the pursuit of a lost (if ever had) personal dignity and pride. Four characters of different ages and extractions, three man and a woman: Luigi, Donato, Rossana and Angelo.","popularity":3.701,"poster_path":"/3dJsNJfL3CKiRRf39rE0KyI2Wux.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":197753,"logo_path":null,"name":"CBFilm","origin_country":""},{"id":14016,"logo_path":"/snclwsIZQbgvqYCBJP8fqNlCA5y.png","name":"MiC","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":10400,"logo_path":"/9LlB2YAwXTkUAhx0pItSo6pDlkB.png","name":"Eagle Pictures","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":20416,"logo_path":"/jTXzZRiKZt7L4YvVW4DGvqU51RU.png","name":"Regione Lazio","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":177305,"logo_path":"/7kye7qcNzgMNcfXikIyKgVLrRSq.png","name":"Prime Vid√©o France","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2017-03-30","revenue":882204,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Furlough","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":120}
