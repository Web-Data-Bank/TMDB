They make a bet, and to prove it, each pulls his favorite pugilist from his pocket, and they set them on the table. A hot battle ensues, in which one of the midgets is knocked out. The sport whose favorite won the fight takes the money with a look of satisfaction, and replaces his man in his pocket. The loser looks very much disgusted as he picks up his man and puts him back in his pocket. Very mystifying.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/q22ko7a5Ww4YkgG2LTwhZWD5lwX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1903-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pocket Boxers","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
