Appearing to simulate London’s CCTV surveillance system, while replicating a video game aesthetic, Lewis’ video is a slow zoom and pan of the street corner area immediately before a building. The camera’s sweep captures passers-by, traffic signage, handrails and barricades, area buildings and a bit of the street. The almost featureless modernist building centrally located in the frame is set against a row of London style tudor flats.","popularity":1.342,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bricklayers Arms","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
