The title indicates the place and progress of the film: it is a three-minute single shot, filmed in Spadina Road in the north of Toronto. We follow the transition from a close-up to a wide shot, all with the fluidity of a long dolly shot that is carefully developed. The movement begins with a reverse dolly shot, going from details of leaves on a tree to a wide shot of an urban landscape, then zooms towards a building and ends on an image of a woman taking some fresh air on her balcony.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spadina: Reverse Dolly, Zoom, Nude","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
