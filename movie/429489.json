For the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho tribes living on the isolated Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming, new contact with lost artifacts risks opening old wounds but also offers the possibility for healing. What Was Ours is the story of how a young journalist and a teenage powwow princess, both of the Arapaho tribe, travelled together with a Shoshone elder in search of missing artifacts in the vast archives of Chicagoâ€™s Field Museum. There they discover a treasure trove of ancestral objects, setting them on a journey to recover what has been lost and build hope for the future.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1P2JjBEyV6ftFpG8gcOeq3e4GCQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What Was Ours","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
