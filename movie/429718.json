The title of the film refers to the belief, expressed by several of characters, that the goldfish retains a memory of something for only three seconds. Tom, one of the principal characters in the film, draws comparisons between this and the human tendency to jump from one relationship to the next, \"forgetting\" the pain that any previous one might have caused. The film shows complexities involved in straight, gay, lesbian, and bisexual relationships.","popularity":1.271,"poster_path":"/cZKNLiqLa39wfOEFDCd9Nvqtmle.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2004-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La memoria de los peces","video":false,"vote_average":1.5,"vote_count":2}
