It was ELP’s first proper live concert, their only previous gig having been a warm up in Plymouth the previous night. Playing in front of a record 600,000 people, at what remains the biggest festival in rock history, they became overnight stars. With a spectacular stage show that included real cannons being fired over the heads of the audience, they became overnight stars with the press raving about their virtuosity and daring. lntercut with the live footage from the show , this film also features brand new Interviews with Keith Emerson, Greg Lake and Carl Palmer as well as their then manager John Gaydon and creates a vivid portrait of the birth o f a band. They would go on from here to become multi-million selling artists, but this unique film is there right at the beginning.","popularity":1.092,"poster_path":"/3doGydID9h57ekjTnXjxw1fJWYs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Emerson, Lake & Palmer: The Birth of a Band, Isle of Wight Festival 1970","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
