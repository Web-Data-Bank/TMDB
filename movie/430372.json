Yagub lives with his adult son Musa in a small house in a desolate place. They lead a solitary life. Musa, mentally disabled and limited in his motor skills, assists his father with his work. Yagub is a carpenter and earns his money especially with coffins, which he carpenters for Georgians and Russians. Whenever being confronted with the clumsiness of his son he often reacts indignantly – with beating. When Musa is diagnosed with a deadly illness, the emotional numbing of the father slowly dissolves as he tries to make the last days of his son as enjoyable as possible – until Sabir delivers a surprising message.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pIIt4S6Hoay6P7W5NEXAwAZ7IHN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72371,"logo_path":"/e9jTO4uAvemFH6holMC4V1SUGh4.png","name":"ifs internationale filmschule köln gmbh","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AZ","name":"Azerbaijan"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2012-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Azerbaijani","iso_639_1":"az","name":"Azərbaycan"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Swing of the Coffin Maker","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
