Everything from cartoons and video games to recorded music and major theatrical films are being designed and promote to \"satisfy\" the public's insatiable lust for the macabre.  Most disturbing is the rise in the practice of Satanism. Law enforcement agencies are unable to keep up with the increasing numbers of heinous, Satanically inspired crimes.  Basically a remake of Devil Worship: The Rise of Satanism (1989) using the same footage.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/x9lUbx7K7Ekr5GYDEy9eK41yeaO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42213,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jeremiah Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pagan Invasion - Doorways To Satan","video":true,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":2}
