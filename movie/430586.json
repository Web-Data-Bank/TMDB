Kakuma refugee camp, built in the middle of the Turkana desert (Kenya), is the fastest growing city in the region. Many of its new arrivals are children sent out of conflict zones by their parents. Against all odds, these children grab all opportunities in the camp to rebuild their life. While waiting for her mother to return from South Sudan, Nyakong (8) starts to go to school. Slowly she creates a new home in the camp. At the age of 17, teenagers like Claude and Khadijo consequently compete for international scholarships, get a job, even build their own house. Filmmaker Lieven Corthouts decided to stay in one of the toughest places on earth and make this camp his home. While filming his friends for more than 4 years, he unveils the accomplishments of these strong, smart children and the true dynamics of a refugee camp. Can Kakuma really offer a future? Or is it just a waiting room, where the only option is to plan your journey to Europe?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sYNGImlnIzDxGFwrFmZBmPdqwNq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Invisible City: Kakuma","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
