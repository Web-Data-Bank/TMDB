Jemilla taught her people to express themselves, rather than bashing each others' heads with rocks and eating each others' babies. But one member of the tribe doesn't seem to fit in: Zazzalil. She's always trying to invent things to make life easier… for herself. While out hatching her latest scheme, Zazzalil stumbles upon the most important discovery in history. One that will pit her tribe against wooly mammoths, saber-toothed tigers, and change the world forever. She'll travel from omega to alpha, and become… the Firebringer!","popularity":1.921,"poster_path":"/y0EeFn2kzKZepq5gr4ycuRD3Dwe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16151,"logo_path":null,"name":"Starkid Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":134,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"At the dawn of civilization, one girl had a bright idea...","title":"Firebringer","video":true,"vote_average":8.4,"vote_count":6}
