For many professing Christians this could be the most important video you ever watch. Perhaps the best expose of many modern so-called “prophets &amp; healers” ever made.  The National Prayer Network out of the United Kingdom has done an admirable job exposing such leaders as Benny Hinn, Kenneth Hagin, and Rodney Howard Brown, revealing that the tactics and methods they use when performing “signs and wonders” have their origin in the occult. These tapes are a sober warning for those caught up in TBN evangelists and leaders, believing them to be “anointed” men and women of God.  Speakers include: Andre Kole, Brian Edwards, Dave Hunt, Mark Haville, Ole Anthony, Dr. Peter May, Philip Foster, Roger Oakland and Dr. Stephan Sizer.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":84558,"logo_path":null,"name":"National Prayer Network (UK)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Signs and Wonders Movement: Exposed","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
