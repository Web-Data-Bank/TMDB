Only a few old people and the poacher Panturle remain. Panturle dreams of bringing the village back to life, finding a wife, founding a family and work as a farmer. One day, the village is visited by a traveling knife-grinder, Urbain Gedemus and a young woman, Arsule. Gedemus treats Arsule like a slave, but Arsule accept this because she has nowhere to go and -we guess- her 'work' with Gedemus is the last thing that saves her from being a prostitute. When she meets Panturle and knows about his dreams, she escapes from Gedemus and decides to stay with him. Together, they start a new life, made of hard farming work but mostly of happiness to have each other - fulfilling the earlier dreams of Panturle. Can anything break the happiness of their new life?","popularity":1.661,"poster_path":"/zJxF6qc6MhR4C98Ryuj4HOX5EdE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19160,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Marcel Pagnol","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1937-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":127,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Harvest","video":false,"vote_average":6.54,"vote_count":25}
