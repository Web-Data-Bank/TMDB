She has been condemned by the Devil to endless pain:she's dead but is forced to be still living for ever and ever. The story is set in undefined place and undetermined time; all the characters will meet, against their will, the charming vampire. This is a movie of gloomy and romantic atmospheres supported by an enthralling soundtrack and a photography with peculiar colours which call up again a good period for italian cinematography.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/myvzUVqnO873mbWDjZUlLYHY32g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84915,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Legend Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"She's thirsty...bloodthirsty!","title":"She: The Vampire","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
