He lived there with his girlfriend Marta. He had two cameras, a 16 mm one and a video tape one.

A personal portrait of a city and a separation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":84924,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kinora","origin_country":""},{"id":84925,"logo_path":null,"name":"Regan, Velasco Inc","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2011-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"True Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
