Hoping to recapture their former glory, they begin by sharing their wacky wisdom with a group of up and coming young snowboarders. The story takes them from the run down ski hill where they grew up to a major event at one of the biggest resorts in the west.","popularity":1.906,"poster_path":"/iXMvcLZwlylGWCFtRu0CD1n3km6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2008-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Ride or be ridden","title":"Shred","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":10}
