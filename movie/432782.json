Filip risks his face and career for the whim of a crazy collector of Jadźka buttons. The sedate professor refuses his friend's indecent request, but he secretly kidnaps himself in a virtually reckless way. Meanwhile, a close-knit group of friends go to the mountains every year. There they discover a mystery that will change their lives forever. What will they choose? Loyalty or money? Friendship or love? Truth or lie? Own or other luck? Every choice for the heroes of the comedy \"Just friendship\" means trouble. Who will help them? We know: friends. Because friendship, like no other investment, always pays off.","popularity":0.973,"poster_path":"/s03vuigOQFDFY9QL49wHQFj0Ikd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":250,"logo_path":"/evWKasiElVQywuKv2dI72P9twz8.png","name":"Canal+ Polska","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":5622,"logo_path":"/bKcpepYRLylECRb5LVkskW0TQIX.png","name":"TVN","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":72638,"logo_path":null,"name":"Agora Films","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2017-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":126,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The friendship of a group of people is put to the test in the face of life's adversities.","title":"Just friendship","video":false,"vote_average":5.975,"vote_count":20}
