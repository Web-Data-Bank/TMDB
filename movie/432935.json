By design, nothing in this film is authentic except the source audio.  The flickering images were produced with a hand-cranked Bolex so that the lip-synch is deliberately erratic and the rear projected, grainy, looped images of Masai tribesmen and women recycled from an educational film become increasingly abstract as the audio transforms into an incantation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mMst5HwZENJzoUuoQO99MAopJqj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Halimuhfack","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
