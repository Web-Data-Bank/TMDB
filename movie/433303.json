Katerina is driven by a lust for life and for love. Her husband, though, is impotent; her father-in-law a tyrant. No wonder, then, that she longs to free herself from this yoke. When Sergei starts work on the family estate, she sees in him a chance for salvation. However, their subsequent affair marks the beginning of a descent into crime.","popularity":0.915,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":28353,"logo_path":null,"name":"TV 2000","origin_country":""},{"id":2329,"logo_path":null,"name":"Krátký film Praha","origin_country":"XC"},{"id":1637,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zweite Medienfonds German Filmproductions","origin_country":""},{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":2}
