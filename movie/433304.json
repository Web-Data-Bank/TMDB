Every day they compete, playing, joking and sometimes a bit of tussling, with other children from the town for the opportunity to tell \"the story\" to the tourists who climb the hill to enjoy the view of the bay, especially as the sun sets over the Caribbean Sea. They must be cunning because there are other storytellers who are older and who left school a long time ago, who are misbehaved, and every day confront them and try to take away their money.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Conquistando el fuerte","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
