To avoid being discriminated against for being a robot, and to undermine his father who created him, he undergoes cosmetic surgery that results in him acquiring a human, but middle eastern looking head. Then 9/11 happens. In order to flee discrimination in a post-9/11 world, he escapes to the middle east where he finally fits in somewhere. He is eventually thrown into prison by a despotic dictator who suspects him of being a spy. Eventually he arrives home to reconcile with his father and accept his dual identity as part human and part robot.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Timmy II","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
