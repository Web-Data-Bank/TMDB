For Brenner, however, there is no reason to worry, because he is firmly counting on a breakthrough with his newly founded company FlowTex.  With innovative horizontal drilling systems, he wants to revolutionize underground pipeline construction. But at first  the big success remains elusive.\r He finally succeeds by  relying on drilling systems and orders that don't even exist, piling up loan upon loan and leasing contract upon leasing contract. He uses charm and persuasion, and for a long time no one notices that Brenner is building a fraudulent consortium of companies with just a few helpers and a lot of falsified documents.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uBMeyPgKCL9LLhX5neEAwJFBMVC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":142343,"logo_path":null,"name":"Polyphon Pictures","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Big Manni","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
