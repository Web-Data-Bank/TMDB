Standing in the way of their love is the insurmountable age gap between the two, as Kostic is 29 years older than his beloved one. The affair inspired one of the most sophisticated and tender love poems of the time, an utmost expression of yearning, in which the poet's unflinching devotion is linked to his admiration for a Venice basilisk by the name of Santa Maria della Salute.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/sYCgn2RWvGTBCUwBixXEfJ6981z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":62357,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vision Team","origin_country":"RS"},{"id":25204,"logo_path":null,"name":"RTS","origin_country":"RS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"}],"release_date":"2016-12-20","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Santa Maria della Salute","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
