Faced with intense emotional scars, as well as physical -- which are realized by the years of self-harm depicted by the cuttings adorning his body -- he enters the bathroom to begin a journey of self-exploration, self-mutilation and quite possibly, self-enlightenment. Prepared only with three white candles and some crude instruments, Daniel attempts to beckon the embrace of the Goddess Ishtar to assist him on his self-illumination.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ygwDLO05aDyu6miaZPKQ3yaOcUF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85072,"logo_path":null,"name":"Enchanted Architect","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":51428,"logo_path":null,"name":"Unearthed Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2017-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"American Guinea Pig: Sacrifice","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
