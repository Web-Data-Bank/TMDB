Surf movies come and go, a million waves in exotic locations and surfers flown in for three‐day shoots on perfect swells, but the spirit of adventure never dies. What began as a three‐month trip to a collection of surf breaks off the beaten track turned into a two‐year odyssey of exploration, injury, companionship and 4,000km of two‐wheeled, single‐finned escape from the real‐world burdens of modern life. Harrison Roach and Zye Norris pack their bags, a diverse quiver of boards, two bikes and a 50‐dollar tent into a 1970s Land Rover and embark on an epic quest from the southern reaches of Bali, through the Indonesian archipelago to Northern Sumatra’s isolated Lagundri Bay.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/41sQbrl79R8dRF9h6uWQe3Bnl9n.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"South to Sian","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":2}
