During this time, UCLA professor Angela Davis was a subject of increasing scrutiny after coming out as a Communist, provoking the ire of administrators and governor Ronald Reagan. Believing that Davis would be an ideal film subject, du Luart immediately began making a documentary, though she would ultimately return to France to complete the project after receiving unwanted attention from the FBI. “Over the course of events,” writes Nicole Brenez, “this appreciative and sensitive portrait of a politically engaged philosopher had been transformed into a call for the liberation of an imprisoned activist and an internationalist revolutionary manifesto.”\" - Film at Lincoln Center","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/utPYEVb5dSG8rc0qldtBcmC1rwB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118280,"logo_path":null,"name":"New American Film Makers Series","origin_country":""},{"id":118281,"logo_path":null,"name":"Whitney Museum of American Art, New York, NY","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1972-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Angela Davis: Portrait of a Revolutionary","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
