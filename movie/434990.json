On the same day, two police officers from the Metropolitan police Special Mission Task Force, Sugishita Ukyo (Yutaka Mizutani) and Kameyama Kaoru (Yasufumi Terawaki), are guarding a female Diet member, Katayama Hinako (Yoshino Kimura). The pair identifies explosives and saves her life. From the clues left at the scene, Sugishita builds up his case and finds a connection between the murder of the TV presenter and the attempted murder of the Diet member. During a painstaking investigation, the savage murder case of a young overseas volunteer five years earlier emerges in the background, and the pair prevents indiscriminate murder at the Tokyo Big City Marathon event by suppressing the perpetrator.","popularity":0.997,"poster_path":"/fr8ipxyK6dQPHTB3GxdflhYhYdw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81418,"logo_path":"/kW9bMQqnMFtPHvdoyCDpRqh7Gxt.png","name":"Nagoya Broadcasting Network","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":4868,"logo_path":"/3ExeT4zGXBFU7ei1crOvuzKnc1z.png","name":"Asahi Broadcasting Corporation","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2008-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"AIBOU: The Movie","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3}
