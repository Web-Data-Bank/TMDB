He grows up to become a minister in the Church of England but disapproves of concern within the church over the social position of the clergy. He concerns himself more with the common people and with individual religious experiences. He tries to accomplish his purposes by remaining within the church but the methodical way in which he and his followers go about their duties soon sets them apart as a special group jeeringly called Methodists.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/smrqo2zX2BbOe3PCaDqf5j54mzE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8233,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rank Organisation, The","origin_country":""},{"id":85483,"logo_path":null,"name":"Radio \u0026 Film Commission of the Methodist Church","origin_country":""},{"id":19757,"logo_path":null,"name":"GHW Films","origin_country":""},{"id":19870,"logo_path":null,"name":"G.H.W.
