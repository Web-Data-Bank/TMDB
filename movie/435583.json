His struggles with everyday life, his past, even the question of 'the existence of a higher power', have led him to evaluate his own life. An assessment, that ultimately drives him to leave work and success behind, and set out on a quest in search of his happiness. But Dante soon learns that it's not that simple, for after a series of painfully humorous attempts fail to provide an answer, Dante sinks even deeper. It is not until he encounters Cynthia, a spiritual guide of sorts, that he uncovers the underlying truth and finally arrives at an answer that surprises even him.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3ghtmg3THEVcXEyBXQCqLOS5A0b.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Calling It Quits","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
