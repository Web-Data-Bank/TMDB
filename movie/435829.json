That is, the light we do see almost always seems to be set against darkness, or occasionally against white, these momentary flickers that materialize tenuously out of emptiness. But the darkness is not ‘night,’ or even simply some more abstract absence of light, but a more profound vacuum: it represents a world stripped of all the coordinates of the known, an unmeasurable absence. […] These lushly sensual, pleasurable-to-view films are also terrifying: their unpredictability, continually enacting new dramas of surprise, alternatively swamps the viewer in light and leaves him adrift in darkness.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/h3pJTEUGPxLxINz3RFTRUrEazmp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-01-18","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Arabic Numeral Series 16","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
