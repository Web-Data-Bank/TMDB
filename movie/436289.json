Based on a violent and erotic biblical story, Saint-Saëns’s opera – composed in 1877, much to Liszt’s insistence – would not be performed at the Palais Garnier until fifteen years later. This first Parisian performance in 1892 included the hitherto unperformed “Dance Of The Priestesses”. Nevertheless, it became one of the most performed French operas in the world, together with Faust and Carmen. Conducted by Philippe Jordan, this new production brings back a repertoire masterpiece that has not been performed at the Paris Opera for twenty-five years.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7Opx8Oj8nPV89Y6qS8UhKCio6gt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Opera in three acts and four scenes (1877)","title":"Saint-Saëns: Samson et Dalila","video":true,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
