There he meets his father as a young man, when he was a member of the Special Forces. As they go through combat together, the son gets to know his father in a way he never has, giving him insight and compassion, and he is able to let go of lifelong feelings of abandonment, resentment and anger. This leads to forgiveness and a real-life reconciliation, which drives home the underlying message of this film restoring the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to the fathers.","popularity":0.919,"poster_path":"/mqnLOZTT3NJpENcrrb7vAXViI91.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72853,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sterkinekor Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2016-08-05","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Afrikaans","iso_639_1":"af","name":"Afrikaans"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The truth will set you free","title":"My Father's War","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
