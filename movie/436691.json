Despite being in motion, the figure seems frozen, almost automated. The little man turns, turns and turns again, in an abstract setting that turns out to be a vinyl record on a turntable in a domestic interior. The beat of the music is reflected and embodied by the continual rotation of the character.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Turning Man","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
