The German play on words actually makes sense in MY KINGDOM FOR A LULLABY #2; it suits a piece, in which electronically generated sounds and images are modulated and combined in a thoroughly sensorial or even ecstatic manner. The term «white noise» refers to both visual and acoustic elements. It is a prevailing theme in this video, an abstract piece, which requires that the viewer look and listen with utmost attention. On a white screen appear horizontal and vertical lines in delicate gray. First they alternate, then overlap, fade, then become more intense. The soundtrack plays a primary role, is equally as powerful (and elusive) as the images: a composition of crackling, noises (Rauschen), and whirring begins to emerge; music comprised of subtle electronic tones and high frequency distortion.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Kingdom for a Lullaby #2","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
