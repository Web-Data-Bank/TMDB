Begrudgingly, Oreki is dragged into an investigation concerning the 45-year-old mystery that surrounds the club room.  Accompanied by his fellow club members, the knowledgeable Satoshi Fukube, the stern but benign Mayaka Ibara, and the ever-curious Eru Chitanda, Oreki must combat deadlines and lack of information with resourcefulness and hidden talent, in order to not only find the truth buried beneath the dust of works created years before them, but of other small side cases as well.","popularity":3.129,"poster_path":"/82aujfdMhUFIvJfTFu8nU4x29yv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46774,"logo_path":"/muOQv2xpkJqfwNthZbTS6ur85ZA.png","name":"Kadokawa Daiei Studio","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2017-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hyouka: Forbidden Secrets","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":10}
