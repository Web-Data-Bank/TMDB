He feels at home in this small oasis of friendliness, though the sounds of war can be heard in the background, violent bandits prowl the roads, and opium is everywhere. As we watch Kaim run from one task to another day after day, we soon realize that we are watching a boy who is being cheated out of his childhood.","popularity":1.254,"poster_path":"/d7MGMcW2foIzA0csOmHCCu91N5d.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":528,"logo_path":"/fO3Aof3lXQclYpBByYC8aneTXwA.png","name":"Bandai Visual","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":119169,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film-e-Aval","origin_country":""},{"id":567,"logo_path":null,"name":"Office Kitano","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":54376,"logo_path":null,"name":"T-Mark","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2001-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Delbaran","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":5}
