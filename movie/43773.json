The husband, a photographer, seeks help at a nearby village and encounters a teacher who offers to help. Whilst the husband and teacher go off to find a spare part, the wife, who used to be a teacher, takes over the teaching lessons in the village.

As the day draws on, the children help to bring a new hope and life into the wife's heart.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/waEwWyCZ96p24eObExtQ6LKCj2x.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":66953,"logo_path":"/4JYTCYLW0ANUddBtjUvwa0MwRvL.png","name":"Farabi Cinema","origin_country":"IR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2002-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Deserted Station","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":5}
