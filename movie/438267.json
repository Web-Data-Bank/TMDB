The Occupation of the American Mind takes an eye-opening look at this critical exception, zeroing in on pro-Israel public relations efforts within the U.S. Narrated by Roger Waters and featuring leading observers of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and U.S. media culture, the film explores how the Israeli government, the U.S. government, and the pro-Israel lobby have joined forces, often with very different motives, to shape American media coverage of the conflict in Israel's favor, and provides a sweeping analysis of Israel's decades-long battle for the hearts, minds, and tax dollars of the American people in the face of widening international condemnation of its increasingly right-wing policies.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rCqkjI3mhLPaTnZYc0u4Okkycij.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27072,"logo_path":null,"name":"Media Education Foundation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Occupation of the American Mind","video":false,"vote_average":8.3,"vote_count":6}
