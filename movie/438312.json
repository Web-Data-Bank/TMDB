Their love is pure and sincere and both hope this will become a solid foundation for both of them in the future.  But the future is indeed unpredictable. Their love is hindered by caste differences. Zulaikha, who is descended from Bugis aristocrats, is not allowed to marry Yusuf, who, although he is well off, is from the common people of Makassar. History repeated itself because in the past, Yusuf's father, Dirham faced a similar polemic. Unlike his father, Yusuf was bolder against custom. He chose to fight for his love and asked Zulaikha to run with him.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4O1jjrtR0hZv9gO4lX84N1mfAqF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":106803,"logo_path":null,"name":"Inipasti Communika","origin_country":""},{"id":106804,"logo_path":null,"name":"Indonesia Sinema Persada","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"2018-01-18","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silariang: Cinta Yang (Tak) Direstui","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
