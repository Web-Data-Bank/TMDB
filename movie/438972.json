The poem by Carlos Queiroz to which the above sentences belong is not cited in 'O som da Terra a Tremer', but the atmosphere is that, between written letters never received. Fiction within fiction, stories within stories, like those Chinese boxes in which there is always one inside another. Or the two margins of the same river, always being lateral.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2PhkyNTJBbsyDH17QStLQhZBovH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8492,"logo_path":"/wYhNCpXIThYDXevad6n90vsMXZ2.png","name":"RTP","origin_country":"PT"},{"id":10447,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fundação Calouste Gulbenkian","origin_country":""},{"id":16407,"logo_path":null,"name":"Inforfilmes","origin_country":""},{"id":17199,"logo_path":null,"name":"Instituto Português de Cinema (IPC)","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"1990-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sound of the Shaking Earth","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":4}
