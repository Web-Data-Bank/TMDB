Guarnieri, besides being a TV star, was also seen as the synthesis of the politically engaged artist in Brazil. His sons, also actors, saw a separation between art, work, and politics. As he investigates the portraits of two generations, grandson and director Francisco aims to understand the place of his own generation in history, in art and the world as a whole.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/h1h2bChPIUJYOTP2gAz1SqulctC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37488,"logo_path":"/xObLKIzR6jojWxCkGPMJdsXRDne.png","name":"Mira Filmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2017-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"PortuguÃªs"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guarnieri","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
