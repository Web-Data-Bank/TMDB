He assaults the nest of two wrens and destroys all their eggs except one that, when hatched, is adopted by an owl (patterned on W. C. Fields). A counter-offensive against Fagin is launched with help enlisted from a seagull named Armstrong, two nice mice and a sparrow. There is romance, too, and a jazzy score goes with this animated ornithology extravaganza.","popularity":5.092,"poster_path":"/6BR71a0ZmaMoLKoRxMR49NW4sXu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"War of the Birds","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":9}
