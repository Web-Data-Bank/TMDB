It's a multi-cultural society, foreigners representing almost 40% of its population.  It's famous for its forward-thinking social policies and - especially - for its financial services.  It used to be known for its steel industry and it still boasts one of the most important media groups in the world.  But it's certainly not known either for soccer or unemployment.  So this is 'Revanche's' recipe: take Luxembourg's unemployed. Put them in business suits. Encourage them to create an international football club which begins to win all its matches.  Into this strange mix, throw in a bunch of international criminals, and a bevy of glamorous Eastern European dream creatures all looking for husbands, fame and fortune.  The result is a delicious humanist fable, a comedy in which love conquers money.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":6938,"logo_path":"/tC0D6PGzq5FAnyPPxnhSQd8FPEv.png","name":"Iris Productions","origin_country":"LU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LU","name":"Luxembourg"}],"release_date":"2004-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"},{"english_name":"Letzeburgesch","iso_639_1":"lb","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Revenge","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
