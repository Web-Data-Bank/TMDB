It now hovers like a time capsule near a man’s face. He looks down, listening in on a female guerrilla fighter and translating her words from Fulani. Within the capsule, money is counted and paid out as a new currency, the numbers of the years run backwards in the black box. A 16-mm film glides through the man's hands and is transferred to a laptop screen frame by frame.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fIC9P7f3eqpNEVz6ZiPIqjeGJlD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76612,"logo_path":"/kE6mXnRHkS3bHpu1hikx1U1pFyo.png","name":"Spectre Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GW","name":"Guinea-Bissau"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Fulah","iso_639_1":"ff","name":"Fulfulde"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spell Reel","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":4}
