Ardent pacifist Roman is sent through a series of humiliating court trials. Losha and Viktor endure long and condescending deliberations that undermine their personalities. Finally, LGBT movement veteran, Johnny is bluntly rebuked and handcuffed. All are put to test by a bureaucratic machine that doesn't sympathize with those who dispute the purposiveness of military service. The conscript enters a room packed with officials. The officials have to listen to his convictions that go in conflict with the idea of military service. It's for the officials to decide whether the conscript leaves the room as a soldier or as a civilian.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/he3WcefBg1pjS1md0IJBT3BGgcV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":119551,"logo_path":null,"name":"Impakt Film","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":101789,"logo_path":"/630Qc7oIXQISYyfZidySVP775Gv.png","name":"Ethnofund Film Company","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2016-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Convictions","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
