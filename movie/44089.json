Filmed in High Definition and recorded in true surround sound, the outstanding singing of the all-star cast, led superbly by Sarah Connolly, and the vivid playing of the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment under the energising baton of William Christie reveal the colour and dramatic character of Handel’s music in a most delightful manner.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/26KkWuIGeLkFyK9Lwwh7MoxNJtf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":36795,"logo_path":null,"name":"Glyndebourne Festival Opera","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2005-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":206,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Giulio Cesare (2005) Glyndebourne Festival Opera.
