In the first, a woman pays her husband's debt by giving herself to the moneylender. In the second, a girl is involved by the priest to whom she confesses. Surprising cinematographic adaptation of the mythological stories of Carlos Zefiro, the king of the \"catechisms\" that rocked the erotic dreams of an entire generation.
