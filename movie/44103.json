He writes a few columns for the Catholic paper, and soon workers are listening and the powerful are in an uproar. He's expelled from the Catholic party, so he starts the Christian Democrats and is elected to Parliament. After Rome disciplines him, he must choose between two callings, as priest and as champion of workers. In subplots, a courageous young woman falls in love with a socialist and survives a shop foreman's rape; children die; prelates play billiards.","popularity":3.022,"poster_path":"/jH0dtpIBt0w0KGsj60zXtHCABqT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":67421,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dérives Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":1259,"logo_path":"/6a5XUQ1c8h8dJragfFs1fpd7SqW.png","name":"Shooting Star Filmcompany","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":167619,"logo_path":null,"name":"Favourite Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1992-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":138,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Latin","iso_639_1":"la","name":"Latin"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Priest Daens","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":46}
