Information suggests that detonation came closer than official reports indicated. The full details of the crash have remained classified and otherwise repressed by the Air Force, but the filmmaker, Portlander Matt McCormick, grew up with this story because the pilot was his grandfather. As McCormick recounts the history of the era, aspects of this crash, and other little-know nuclear-weapons accidents, he leaves us wondering if the U.S. was in greater danger of nuking itself than of being attacked by the Russians.","popularity":0.881,"poster_path":"/7BX6hTGnW9THPIenB0xE6MDLI5V.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Buzz One Four","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
