The conversation turns toward the irony of self-starvation in a land of plenty and toward the international politics of food, where food aid is used as a negotiating tool. Confronting a serious issue, Rosler simultaneously sets into play the confessional form and the ghoulish staginess of talk show dramatics.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Losing: A Conversation with the Parents","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
