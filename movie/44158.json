But tomorrow she's off for school in France, and maybe she only granted this miracle as a parting gift for her long time friend. So tonight is Bruno's last chance. And tonight, as it happens, Broken Social Scene, her favourite band, is throwing a big outdoor bash. Maybe if Bruno, with the help of his best pal Blake, can score tickets and give Caroline a night to remember, he can keep this miracle alive.","popularity":1.606,"poster_path":"/fhmBiCQZ3Z4PCvSYGyMlWHH1y1e.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12976,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shadow Shows","origin_country":""},{"id":164,"logo_path":"/v3zcUepvKC7Vz36yjklk1rw6k8Q.png","name":"Rhombus Media","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2010-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Love is instrumental.","title":"This Movie Is Broken","video":false,"vote_average":3.6,"vote_count":11}
