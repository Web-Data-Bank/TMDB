One year ago I started to explore his 30.8 square meters with my camera. This portrait of a man in his workroom emerged.  Papers cover the floor, mixed up – a lot of contradictory details. In between noted thoughts, mathematical formulas, graphic sketches, and receipts there are novels, scientific books, issues of ‘The New York Review of Books,’ tools, lenses, pieces of wood, cardboards, plastic bags, and dust. In the mysterious chaos a self-willed world of a mathematician, thinker, art historian, and handyman becomes visible.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2017-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In His Room","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
