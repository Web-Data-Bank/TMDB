This box of treats is crammed full of his trademark saucy humour, inventiveness and a childlike sense of fun. Bourne's Nutcracker-with-a-twist still follows the theme of growing up and first love, a coming of age story told through the dreams and nightmares of a young girl.","popularity":0.68,"poster_path":"/uH00tPwlYKWWfUTdC5JuDgt2Lsh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2003-12-22","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Matthew Bourne's Nutcracker!","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
