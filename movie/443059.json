Filmed over the course of 1 day from sunup to sundown.  Constraint:\r Each individual shot in the iPhone cut (filmed and edited one month prior) was timed and each location mapped. Because the film was edited sequentially in-camera, physical movement through space was required in mimicking the cuts of the digital version - an unfolding of montage in real environments. The iPhone movie was constructed so as to form a map, the 16mm film is the traversing of the points plotted. Periodic shots of empty skies mark the passage of time through color.  The filmâ€™s digital counterpart has been deleted.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sUee5cZebF50zG39jjXGrizWYqe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vigil, Split","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
