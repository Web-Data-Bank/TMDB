Director Tribuson demonstrates a deft talent for juggling comic romantic disasters from a woman’s point of view as her characters negotiate the bamboozling ways of love. Middle-aged Verica (acclaimed actress Marinković) pours her heart into her café’s pastries, but she can’t seem to find a like-minded lover until a duplicitous handyman with pheromones to spare and an eye for the ladies sets off a chain of unforeseen adventures all tied together by one fateful plate of tasty treats.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rVgUhXK6vHqp7SXFOLNJmMbsu8L.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20916,"logo_path":"/kTzjchV1BXm1kSmR5vPRUnJfLil.png","name":"Kinorama","origin_country":"HR"},{"id":20915,"logo_path":"/g0ZgDi0m0RubOnoUFYaHsa8M5To.png","name":"Hrvatska Radiotelevizija","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"}],"release_date":"2016-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All the Best","video":false,"vote_average":2.6,"vote_count":5}
