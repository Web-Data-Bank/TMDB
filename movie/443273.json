Narrated from the point of view of the river itself, using dreamlike sequences and archival material made by ordinary Irish people in the 50’, 60’s and 70’s from Derry and Inishowen, Donegal, we hear the stories of ship building and war, immigration, the rise of the most recent conflicts in 1969 and the loss of jobs and industry. But, the river also tells stories of past glories, dreams for a prosperous future and the building of a bridge that spans the waters hoping for peace. As the river gently moves between the shores of Derry and Londonderry reflections of what the past holds and what the future might bring and what lies beyond its borders and it asks the question: Are the dreams of those that lived before the violence different from those who dream today? And what happened to those dreams?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nLOv0AMRX8YRl4csaIMzNjAycL4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Time is a river which carries  ​me along, but I am the river...","title":"Tides: A History of Lives and Dreams Lost and Found ​(some broken)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
