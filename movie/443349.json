Gitta Alpar stars as Eve, whose emotions are torn between two European princes, lifelong rivals who happen to be brothers. Eve prefers the nicer of the two princes, but this doesn't stop the other from aggressively stepping up his courtship. When the less agreeable of the two monarches takes control of the throne, he orders Eve to make an immediate choice between himself and his brother. Though old-fashioned in concept and execution, \"Die - oder keine\" benefitted from the charming presence of Gitta Alper.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kCLWGqjuu3HkZlz9Eb43X2RUuS1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":93617,"logo_path":null,"name":"Carl Froelich Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1932-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This One or None","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
