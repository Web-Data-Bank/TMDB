Burtnett introduces the musical numbers as well as the musician doing the tune and for the most part I thought this was fairly entertaining. \"Miss Annabelle Lee\" was the final number and probably the highlight of everything but the other numbers are well worth listening to.","popularity":0.823,"poster_path":"/AuLuyBTQs0ecbQXnSHwcKRnn6Qo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":174,"logo_path":"/IuAlhI9eVC9Z8UQWOIDdWRKSEJ.png","name":"Warner Bros.
