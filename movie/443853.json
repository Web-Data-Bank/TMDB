Bassist Jasper takes his video camera in and out of tour vans and people's faces along the way—and this is what it looks and sounds like: clips of interviews, scenery, gigs, people, music and 'things that happen', meshed together to give a wide-angle picture of a band on (and off) tour. Using footage from throughout the band's history, it includes Poland in 1994, Australia and New Zealand in 1997, America, from New York to San Francisco, in September 1999 and Winchester to France in 1999—2000","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"10 Years in 47 Minutes!","title":"Citizen Fish: Gaffer Tape","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
