Greek Orthodox Patriarch Irineos was accused of selling church property to Jewish settlers. He denied all the accusations. But for the first time in the church's 2000-year history, its leader was ousted. For 11 long years, Irineos was imprisoned in his chambers. In this first-person account, filmmaker Danae Elon unravels what really happened to the former Patriarch. With unprecedented access to the inner workings of the church, a riveting, mysterious, disturbing, and often humorous story is revealed about an unknown world within the walls of Jerusalem's Old City.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aXmao59wThbYF9EwNhnMaWIQTbG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2016-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Patriarch's Room","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
