The prosecution allows his motive was fear of being disinherited if he married his fianc√©, the fair Alicia Atherton, against his uncle's wishes, and the prosecution lays a mountain of evidence against Raymond, including his razor, dragged from an artificial lake on the estate, as the murder weapon; Raymond's bloody fingerprints and footprints found at the scene of bedroom crime, and his bloody shoes, found in his cupboard and bloody monogrammed-handkerchief found under his uncle's death bed. Raymond's only defense is that he could not have committed the crime as he goes into a paroxysm of dread at the mere sight of blood, a phobia he has had ever since childhood when his dog was run over by a lorry and the dog's blood was splattered into his face.","popularity":0.651,"poster_path":"/2D4twnLPtKKwXfc24Duz1CQvrqN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28184,"logo_path":null,"name":"BIF","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1934-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What Happened Then?","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2}
