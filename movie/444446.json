Tenor Matthew Polenzani brings both steely resolve and compassionate warmth to the title king of Crete, who is faced with an impossible decision. With her rich mezzo-soprano, Alice Coote sings the trouser role of Idomeneo’s son Idamante, who loves the Trojan princess Ilia, sung with delicate lyricism by Nadine Sierra. Elza van den Heever gives a thrillingly unhinged portrayal of the jealous Elettra. Jean Pierre-Ponnelle’s timeless production blends the grandeur of ancient myth with the elegance of Enlightenment ideals.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ylbzst4509J2E3tGA7JNLVRBB8X.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":202,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Metropolitan Opera: Idomeneo","video":true,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
