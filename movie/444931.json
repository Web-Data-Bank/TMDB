The story of Atari is two-thirds the story of Nolan Bushnell, founder and visionary, and one-third the first and probably biggest boom and bust of the new economy some 20 years before the new economy even existed.  Atari was showing that technology is cool, way before the personal computer revolution took place and they were reaching out to an ever-growing audience with something that is still cool today: video games.  Atari literally introduced the digital world to the mass consciousness.","popularity":1.543,"poster_path":"/yF3Xwb5vBIkfPD4OfxS4DtdIkS2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118836,"logo_path":null,"name":"Junk Food Films","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Easy to Learn, Hard to Master: The Fate of Atari","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":8}
