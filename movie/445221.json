The gaucho descends from the union between the indigenous population and Iberian immigrants. Gauchos adopted the Indígenas’ approach to livestock farming and are always associated with horses and vast open plains. The drama occurs when the brother falls from a horse and can no longer be saved. Man and horse become one, for a short moment. Then he draws a knife and revenge violates the idyll: An eye for an eye, a man for a beast. Fire burns on the street, the gaucho mounts his horse and revenge runs its course. The mythical realm overflows into the realm of reality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":6458,"logo_path":"/eT4oMUK7ODM0vvZue8yq3Ojwqf8.png","name":"INCAA","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2017-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Centaur","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
