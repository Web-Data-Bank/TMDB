The film image is the view through a window, the window-frame providing a constant spatial reference point, as the view beyond is modified by a series of major and minor variations in camera viewpoint. The film is presented un-edited just as it was filmed in the camera. The patterns of camera movement are not the product of a pre-given shooting script, but rather they evolved actually at the time of filming.” – William Raban","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u1O0n6UcrYQBXu9HjuHkQXq4f7L.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Angles of Incidence","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
