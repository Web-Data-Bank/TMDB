Familiar devices such as the Nintendo Game Boy and Nintendo Entertainment System are pushed in new directions with startling results. Using New York as a microcosm for a larger global movement, 'Reformat the Planet' maps out the genesis of the first annual Blip Festival, a four day celebration of over 30 international artists exploring the untapped potential of low-bit video game consoles. With floor-stomping rhythms and fist-waving melodies, trailblazers of the ChipTune idiom descend upon Manhattan to pen a new chapter in the history of electronic music.","popularity":0.991,"poster_path":"/9f0VatwWoBHcTXskgGNBaBFUWt9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12493,"logo_path":null,"name":"2 Player Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":127600,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fangamer","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reformat the Planet","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3}
