So, when Shinobu has to both write a script as well as make costumes for a play for the school festival, it doesn't take long for her classmates to realize that someone might have bitten off more than she can chew. Or write and sew, in this case. Fortunately for Shinobu's theatrical future, Alice, Yoko, and Aya are glad to pitch in, and that allows for a chance to reflect on their experiences in the days before Alice arrived. Will everything be finished in time, or will the audience be in stitches because of the ones coming apart onstage? There's no way to be sure until the last curtain call!","popularity":1.981,"poster_path":"/1EXPuFc5qPywvfFWrTuKJSHLFpC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25504,"logo_path":"/sWnGpj6TF4BIo2tBrmF2NBI4IA9.png","name":"Studio Gokumi","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2016-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kinmoza!
