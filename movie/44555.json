His neglected, sharp-tongued wife is involved in a secret affair with Li, one of Wang’s employees. A timid man, Li reluctantly keeps the gun his lover has bought to kill her husband. But Wang is watching their every move. He bribes patrol officer Zhang to murder the illicit couple. It seems like a perfect plan: the affair will come to a cruel, bloody but satisfying end or so he thinks. The equally wicked Zhang has an agenda of his own. As the plot twists, more blood will flow, and ever greater violence will erupt.","popularity":4.824,"poster_path":"/zqIjReP7BAx3OqKayy7vwIQ1Kqv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":724,"logo_path":null,"name":"Beijing New Picture Film Co.
