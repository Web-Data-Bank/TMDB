In this sense, it is a moving testimony. Vitali alternates rehearsal sessions and interviews - by Jean-Marie Straub, Danièle Huillet and actors such as Giovanna Daddi, Angela Nugara and Andrea Bacci - who illuminate from the inside the methods of the two filmmakers and their relation to the work of Cesare Pavese, while situating the very special place that makes this work possible - the small town of Buti which warmly welcomed Straub and Huillet for a decade - and by bringing out the political dimension of their thought.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Straub-Huillet e Pavese: Quei Loro Incontri","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
