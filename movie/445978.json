In the near future, most developed countries have merged. Zéro Janvier, CEO of the biggest corporation in \"The Occident\" (as the new Western state is known) is campaigning to become President on a platform vowing to eliminate the terrorist group The Black Stars and their leader Johnny Rockfort. He has convinced the Stars' information broker Sadia to secretly work for him, while also courting the retiring film star Stella Spotlight. Meanwhile, Johnny Rockfort plans to kidnap television sweetheart Cristal, but he falls in love with her instead. Overlooking all this is Marie-Jeanne, a waitress in the café where the Black Stars meet, and her friend Ziggy, an obsessive David Bowie fan whose dearest wish is to appear on Cristal's music program STARMANIA. The show recounts these entwined love stories set in parallel, touching also on themes of terrorism, totalitarianism, and an individual's right to decide his own destiny.","popularity":1.965,"poster_path":"/4DmzyZioXyG2g3yKaxcjFqwHEpr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48503,"logo_path":null,"name":"Warner Music Vision","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Starmania","video":true,"vote_average":8.7,"vote_count":8}
