Her only personal belonging is the memory of her two great loves: her mother and husband. Thanks to them Lola has something to do every day, going to the main door’s window to check on her husband who lives across the street and to the phone, where she tries to call her mother. Both died long ago, but they are Lola’s only strength to reach her end in a world that, otherwise, is very impersonal for her.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uWyKe9NppXN0LuZnmw8FkPxHKWL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":87630,"logo_path":null,"name":"Marsu Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2017-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Her only personal belonging is the memory of her two great loves: her mother and husband.","title":"While Waiting","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
