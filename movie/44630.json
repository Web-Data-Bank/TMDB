By early 1917, the average life-span of a British pilot is less than a fortnight. Such losses place a fearsome strain on Gresham, commanding officer of the squadron. Aces High recreates the early days of the Royal Flying Corps with some magnificently staged aerial battles, and sensitive direction presents a moving portrayal of the futilities of war.","popularity":7.205,"poster_path":"/a0KjutaTqDwqH8FaxiSuGA4tcg0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1527,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Productions Jacques Roitfeld","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":19662,"logo_path":null,"name":"S.
