A group of young hippies go camping accompanied by an uptight, sexually repressed, middle-aged chaperone. The chaperone is envious of the youngster's liberated ways and doesn't trust one of the young men. Then the group is plagued by a series of vicious knife murders. Directed by Israeli-born Jourdan Alexander (as \"Jaacov Jaavoci\") and written by Svetlana, both of whom would make a name for themselves in hardcore porn, this one's nearly impossible to track down nowadays.
