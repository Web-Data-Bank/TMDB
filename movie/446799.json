A bar, a toilet, a wasteland, a garden, a trailer. The cruising body can't, unlike the flaneur, be alone. She won't leave the world outside of her. Several eyes follow her: the women holding the cameras, the director. The director is sending her a love letter. The director needs her cruising body. They are a part of each others fantasies and share a dream about a city's possibility of providing safe sexy spaces. They travel together to look for the rooms in between, to find rooms of their desires.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uAQxBVetGRfPgleJVFfB7uEb419.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When We Are Together We Can Be Everywhere","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
