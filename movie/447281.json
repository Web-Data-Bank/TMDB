The plot of the animation unfolds during the wedding celebration of the Fox. All forest residents are invited to the celebration, everyone is walking and having fun. But, unfortunately, not everyone can behave properly. The Elephant, imagining that he was the largest, and therefore the strongest, decided that there was no justice for him, and began to behave like he did, while spoiling everyone a feast.
