Deeper, darker, and definitely more bizarre.","popularity":0.901,"poster_path":"/e38rNoTwMusAc3gYxJBddILoH4g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":87918,"logo_path":null,"name":"Smash TV","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Megaplex","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
