The pair of hard-punching middleweights will headline Saturday’s HBO PPV card (9 p.m. ET) from Madison Square Garden in New York, where Golovkin, a native of Kazakhstan, has built a boisterous following thanks to four knockout victories inside “The World’s Most Famous Arena.”  Golovkin will look for his 24th consecutive knockout against Jacobs, a secondary titlist from the same Brownsville section of Brooklyn, New York, that has produced so many great fighters. Jacobs, who returned to boxing in 2012 after beating a rare form of bone cancer, is 10-0 with 10 KOs since coming back.  GGG will also aim for his 18th straight title defense, which would move him two shy of Bernard Hopkins’ middleweight record.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/s8TOMnlrdDvQKdVXCUc5njdmaG4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6751,"logo_path":"/giPzzhPdiNloiuwo7qLagRn5uGH.png","name":"HBO Sports","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gennady Golovkin vs. Daniel Jacobs","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
