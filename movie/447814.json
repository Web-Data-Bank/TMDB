In the crazy 90s with the sexual confusion, substance abuse, and welfare-abuse prevalent, the quest often involves desperate acquaintances (prostitutes, crazy, wrong choices), but most often through a very personal bond of their own. The three are different: One is gay just coming out, another is a \"liberated heterosexual\" looking for love (in all the wrong places), and the third a manic depressive who alternates between mental wards and a yuppy existence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gtDnKDCdnGCJfkdI2nciuQEq5vt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12992,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mefistofilm A/S","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"1998-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Desperate Acquaintances","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
