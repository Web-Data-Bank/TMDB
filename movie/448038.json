Flowers are revealed, birds sing, animals take care of others. Only an evil crocodile who could not catch anyone, attacks the sun and swallows it. It is darkness. The animals in a panic run to the bear and ask to return the sun to the sky. The bear, who in the dark could not find the cubs, goes to war with the crocodile.
