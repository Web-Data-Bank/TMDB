She attends a school with one of the highest dropout rates in New Hampshire and has dealt with homelessness, abuse, and ADHD. As a freshman, she didn't earn a single academic credit, but she did get suspended for dealing drugs. 'Who Cares About Kelsey?' is the story of Kelsey's transformation from a defiant and disruptive 'problem student' to a motivated and self-confident young woman. Along the way, critical figures in her personal and educational life shape her coming of age and play important roles in an education revolution that's about empowering--not overpowering--our most emotionally and behaviorally challenged youth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3yhNPZAT8ec4SGqJ0kgYTy5Fxjk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88077,"logo_path":null,"name":"Institute on Disability at the University of New Hampshire","origin_country":""},{"id":88078,"logo_path":null,"name":"DH Photography","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Who Cares About Kelsey?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
