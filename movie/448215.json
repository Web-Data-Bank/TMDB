Each program features easy-to-follow moves with lots of intensity options. The first workout is mostly low-impact. It's taught as one giant \"add on\" — you'll do a move, repeat it, then add on another. The second program is a little harder. It features simple athletic drills performed at varying impact levels. For example, a low-impact step-squat followed by a higher-impact pop-squat (but one exerciser nearly always shows an easier modification). Both workouts get progressively more intense as they go on. Kelly's basic choreography and straightforward cuing make it totally doable. DVD includes a bonus 14-minute abs/hips/glutes toning program. ©2012.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oJTERrmTyPz9Nwsrq32eBqR1gg1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"30 Minutes to Fitness Cardio Quick Fix","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
