They're designed to help you do everyday activities with comfort and confidence. Kelly's well-planned sequencing makes them easy. First, she includes lots of between-move stretches (e.g. a \"superman,\" then a stretch, then a modified \"superman\"). Second, she maximizes results by combining complementary routines (e.g. pairing a pelvic tilt with a torso rotation to strengthen your back and loosen your hips at the same time). It's all taught in a straight-forward, \"fitness style\" manner â€” not dumbed down or \"medical.\" Note: the second workout is re-edited from the first.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eR6L6eIN6g6iGOqI0qwP9UVtnlU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"30 Minutes to Fitness Your Healthy Back","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
