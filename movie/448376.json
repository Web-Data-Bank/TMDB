Through this process Moffatt unites the graphic punch and suggestiveness of the still image with the satisfaction of a complete movie narrative. In the end, its only a movie.  ‘Love’ embodies Moffatt’s desire to create work that has an ‘international look’ and deal with ‘universal predicaments’. 'Love' is both parody and pastiche, critical comment, and wryly humorous.","popularity":1.127,"poster_path":"/uzhch7bmKJYsOL4dUUWZGgk6BtI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
