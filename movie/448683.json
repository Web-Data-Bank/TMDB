In the story, Dolphy has a half-brother (Navarro) who is based in London. One day, a package was delivered to him and since it was huge, he remarked: “Ang bait naman ng kapatid ko, nagpadala pa ng refrigerator.” The ref turned out to be a coffin and when Dolphy opened it, there was Rod Navarro — deader than dead. I consider that a master stroke because from comedy, the audience was engulfed within moments by a horror scene that was scary.","popularity":1.34,"poster_path":"/tNzqB43nTFeiW2tcvrkLSj7GsRs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"1973-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Drakula Goes to R.P.","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
