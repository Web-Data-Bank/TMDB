Twelve years after 'Los viajes escolares' (1973), his first commercial feature film, the Madrid director Jaime Chávarri returns to the same estate in the province of Segovia to shoot a new family story, about his own plot and script. Like its predecessor, 'The Golden River' contains a strong autobiographical charge and is full of personal resonances. But this new history of family ties is narrated from a perspective in which adultery manifests itself openly. Endowed with a slow narrative rhythm, the film presents an international cast headed by Ángela Molina, Bruno Ganz, Francesca Annis and Stefan Gubser. The film also has the presence of a very young Juan Diego Botto, in one of his first appearances on the big screen.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cmsguzQYoCT30Fz4xQpfSo2gNdO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84691,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tesauro S.A.","origin_country":""},{"id":88169,"logo_path":null,"name":"fedral films international","origin_country":""},{"id":88170,"logo_path":null,"name":"marea filmproduktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1986-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El río de oro","video":false,"vote_average":3.7,"vote_count":7}
