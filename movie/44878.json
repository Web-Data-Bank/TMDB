This is a landscape and population that is changing rapidly as small scale agriculture is disappearing and the generation who inhabited a pre-mechanised world is dying out. Much influenced by his conversations with the writer Peter Handke, the film maker leads us on a poetic and profound journey into a world of endings and beginnings; a world of stuffed owls, sheep and fire.","popularity":1.238,"poster_path":"/a4GJqz91B7NPysJQ5Vd639mmyGy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Welsh","iso_639_1":"cy","name":"Cymraeg"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sleep Furiously","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":12}
