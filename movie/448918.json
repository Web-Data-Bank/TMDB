She attempts to commit suicide, but gets distracted by a large pimple on her nose. Being obsessed with how others view her, the discovery of her pimple sets Nuknik on a journey into the imperfections of the world and herself, where she battles with the core of her existence.  With slight horror elements, this experimental film is a mirror for the modern viewer to recognise our restless state of anxiety, the constant preoccupation with our self image, and the vicious cycle of being caught up in our self-absorbed neurosis.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/w1T5oUEPcp3OltawRh3WMsfsIyr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":194711,"logo_path":null,"name":"Morning Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"2013-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Beauty is more important than life","title":"From a Pimple to Nirvana","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
