Under the \"New Village\" campaign, all the villagers will be moved into the nearly completed Luxury Buildings. The documentary depicts the life of two groups of people, miners and villagers. The miners who are from all over the country, lost their jobs because of the Olympic Games in Beijing - the mine was shut down to make the air less polluted. The villagers had no better luck. Granny Fan lost two sons and two grandsons in a mining accident. Old Han and Old Wang are still farming. Some youngsters are gambling in the house of Han Bin, who was crippled in another mining accident. In the film, you can also see the village election, the service of local Christians, and people worshipping for a better year to come.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/a8e8ZarIYFH9Z0vOwya6B67LFVL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"New Castle","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
