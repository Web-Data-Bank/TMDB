There’s a murderer who goes by the moniker Devil Swordsman gallivanting around the countryside in an outfit that looks like a ninja cloak by way of a KKK robe who’s killing all of the major kung fu masters and clan leaders with a single swipe to the face. One of his first victims is the head of the White Dragon tribe, whose son, Shan, is played by Dorian Tan Tao-Liang. Shan naturally assumes the role of detective in order to avenge his father, since that’s what people do in these movies.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/g0HfBYby06UJ3SIXFd1wB4tcgyb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116355,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tien Sing Motion Picture Co.
