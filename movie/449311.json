He was also one of our great experimental filmmakers and once apparently made Salvador Dali extremely jealous at a screening of his masterpiece, Rose Hobart.  In this film we get to hear people like Susan Sontag, Stan Brakhage, and Tony Curtis talk about their friendships with the artist. It turns out that Curtis was quite a collector and he seemed to have a very deep understanding of what Cornell was doing in his work.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/awqxrLsNATJPBEm4lzlOhUZvl91.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Joseph Cornell: Worlds in a Box","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
