A one-eyed 'tartalo' who's been up all night is swindled by a man because he's got the miracle ring he talks about. A naughty little Kukubiltxo makes the cows and burros talk when he hides in the ear of a donkey. A lying demonic Galtzagorri is unashamed. In short, universal myths from the stages of today and yesterday in the Basque Country.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/btnBgbjrsTIgapLK6nEqldLjVjz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42298,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lan Zinema","origin_country":""},{"id":88312,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eresoinka","origin_country":""},{"id":88313,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jaizkibel Kultur Zerbitzuak","origin_country":""},{"id":128508,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lotura Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1986-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Basque","iso_639_1":"eu","name":"euskera"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kalabaza tripontzia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
