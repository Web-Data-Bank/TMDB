The Lebanese war is over but the Syrian one still rages on. The workers are locked in the building site. They are not allowed to leave it after 19.00. The Lebanese government has imposed night-time curfews on the refugees. The only contact with the outside world for these Syrian workers is the hole through which they climb out in the morning to begin a new day of work. Cut off from their homeland, they gather at night around a small TV set to get the news from Syria. Tormented by anguish and anxiety, while suffering the deprivation of the most basic human and workers right, they keep hoping for a different life.","popularity":0.881,"poster_path":"/4rcK75KWx5HWrWNd6hASr8LCsXz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"},{"iso_3166_1":"SY","name":"Syrian Arab Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"AE","name":"United Arab Emirates"},{"iso_3166_1":"QA","name":"Qatar"}],"release_date":"2017-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Taste of Cement","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":8}
