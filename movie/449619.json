While there, Barney and the Backyard Gang tour the studio on their own, while producing their own show. From a cereal commercial set and a puppet show and the six little ducks and teddy bears and the US flag and an island paradise and a make up place to a jungle, the show is filmed along with many props in the studio. With the power of imagination and some movie magic, anything is possible when Barney's around.","popularity":0.659,"poster_path":"/hsmaNYzbJzdE93Lx8hc433fsvG6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":68632,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Lyons Group","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rock with Barney","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
