The reels provide glimpses into the Florida fishing trip taken by Herbert and Lou Hoover in late January 1929, when he was President-elect.  This would be the last vacation before assuming the Presidency on March 4, 1929, and before the burdens of his office began to wear on the First Family.  Other reels capture playful scenes of grandchildren and vacation trips of taken by the Hoovers’ sons, and touristy images of Washington, DC, historic sites. Scenes of the White House gardens reflect Mrs. Hoover’s concept for the exterior appearance of the garden plots. The final reel of film shows the first color images of President Hoover in his morning routine of tossing a medicine ball with others.  This activity would eventually become the game known as Hooverball.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"rare, early Kodacolor films","title":"Lou Hoover's Home Movies","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
