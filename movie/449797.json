Clipson and Onda each investigate very personal, intuitive spaces, through their favored technologies of Super 8mm film and cassette Walkman. Both artists base a significant emphasis of their work on performance environments, where their visual and sonic field recordings interact to create sensory collages born out of the subjective impressions of the audience.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p4IljWGMphRgL0VAMlAvuujTh8g.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ephemeris","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
