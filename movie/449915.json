Even though there are professional footballers, they are all unemployed. And they look desperately for a job. \"The Other Fields\" sheds a new and completely different light on the mythologies of contemporary football. While some may think that “bling-bling” and “glitz” is all there is to modern football, Marco Kugel’s and Simon Quack’s film shows the intricate economic and moral complexities behind the façade of entertainment. Dreams only last a season or two.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aTvx5TOUXUBwFQSoHIbc4BVQw87.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2017-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Other Fields","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
