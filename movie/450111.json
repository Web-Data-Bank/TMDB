The entries allow her to discover a different woman. Having grown up in the worship of her father who fought as a partisan during the war, Lorena realises that she must start digging in the secret story of her mother if she wants to understand aspects of her own life. The pages of the diary feel like a book from another time. Working as a nurse, her mother was covertly working for the partisans passing them intelligence that she astutely acquired from wounded German soldiers by administering more morphine than usually required to ease the pain.","popularity":1.377,"poster_path":"/1UlX1Aps38q0QjFysrhCNCngJTR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92608,"logo_path":null,"name":"Quasar Multimedia","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2017-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Every Soul of my Body","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
