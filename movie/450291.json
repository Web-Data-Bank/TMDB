The work has no sound. It lasts for seven minutes.  Martyrs was joined in 2016 by a second piece entitled Mary. The installations have been gifted to Tate, and are on long-term loan to St Paul’s Cathedral.  Bill Viola's commission for St Paul’s Cathedral follows the great historical tradition of commissions for spiritual centres that has resulted in a priceless heritage of art around the world.  The result of this commission sees St Paul’s Cathedral, which has always spearheaded the engagement of great artists, house a resonant work of art for our times. Martyrs (and later Mary), will play an important role in connecting contemporary issues with the timeless themes embodied in the cathedral.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/e0YM03v9o3kxgGkPKLrI1TFDsmi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Martyrs","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
