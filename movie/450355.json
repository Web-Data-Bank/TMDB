Some 3,500 meters above sea level with only her faithful dog and gray cat for company, she studies climate change on the Tuyuksu Glacier at an old Soviet-era research station. She loves the solitude and silence that her painstaking work brings her. Magnificent shots of her surroundings and everyday work are interspersed with archive footage of the people who preceded her by a century. Not much seems to have changed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zYBifJZTyJrEqSF0aMBqs2HHOx1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103826,"logo_path":null,"name":"OÜ Vesilind","origin_country":"EE"},{"id":118250,"logo_path":null,"name":"Uku Studija","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"},{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"2016-04-03","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Woman and the Glacier","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":1}
