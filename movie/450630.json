Beyond the myth, the legends and sometimes, the curses, this film by GÃ©rard Miller allows us to discover his work and his personality, through the testimony of his patients, his students, and also his relatives. Born with the XXth century into an upper-middle-class Catholic family, a psychiatrist by training, with an encyclopaedic knowledge of culture, a friend of Picasso, Levi-Strauss and Sartre, Lacan was a great theoretician, an outstanding practitioner, and he remains the most modern, the most challenging and even the most sulphurous of psychoanalysts. The director Gerard Miller met Lacan thanks to his brother, Jacques-Alain, the most faithful of his students, who married his daughter Judith. Their close and intense relationship makes this film exceptional.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qhUHWcMPkcB1c9R0erFanG8DYLN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11244,"logo_path":"/gCHH1xt3dKjlm9NuMPF9ekpPWD6.png","name":"France 3","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":20442,"logo_path":"/bJdNEHt2r5D3hVolSLN9UP1azi0.png","name":"Morgane Production","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2011-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rendez-vous chez Lacan","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":3}
