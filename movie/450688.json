Is there a scientific legacy - a before and after Lévi-Strauss - in anthropology?  This documentary retraces the intellectual path of the author of \"Tristes tropiques\" (\"A World on the Wane\") and \"La Pensée sauvage\" (\"The Savage Mind\"), Claude Lévi-Strauss. The anthropologist and founder of structural anthropology in France is portrayed via numerous selected extracts of interviews he has given since the 1960s. The film is a fascinating introduction into the mind of a man who is interested in all men. Lévi-Strauss has great confidence (in spite of a pessimistic view of our contemporary world) in the creative capacities of the human mind.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3WGBUlHqed3Wu1yNw5e6fqEGzIC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Claude Lévi-Strauss par lui-même","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
