Our movie holds exactly to the desire of making perceptible his singularity. In this purpose, the movie is constituted by an editing of archives, articulated around Barthes presence and the progress of his career. It is thus a kind of a Roland Barthes’s cinematic version by Roland Barthes, a self–portrait that could be resumed by a point of view as accurate as possible.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tTpwsVX5UYeyTAqIhqEkEpkb8Ku.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80154,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films d'Ici 2","origin_country":""},{"id":22642,"logo_path":"/gqFSMOsv68FkYalHrKbUvq3pGwh.png","name":"Ina","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2015-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Roland Barthes, 1915-1980: Le théâtre du langage","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
