In an imaginary present, humanity faces extinction because of a terrible pandemic. The only way to escape death is to avoid all contact with human beings, to flee, to be completely alone. After long wandering a man and a woman find shelter in an isolated house in the mountains. They hope to save themselves by adapting to an essential, almost primitive life. Nature watches over them, observing them from above. Everything flows, everything changes, everything is in transformation. Is avoiding man enough to avoid death?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/osGMfpx3RBXRLXuxKIV3kmVYfJT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88616,"logo_path":null,"name":"Minimal Cinema","origin_country":""},{"id":88617,"logo_path":null,"name":"Axelotil","origin_country":""},{"id":88618,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kio Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2015-06-27","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ananke","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
