By using found footage of diverse origin - political announcements, animal life, porn - and intertwining it with images recorded by Agnew himself-- cityscapes, abstract light essays-- the film abandons any attempt of evoking meaning of any sort and focuses on a strictly formal exercise centred on time intervals and micro-relations between small sets of images. The soundtrack, recorded by Duane Hitchings (known for his collaborations with Miles Davis and Hendrix, but also for his Flashdance OST) on a Moog synth, is an engaging exercise in abstract sonic dynamics and an essential part of the Doppler experiment in that it not only provides different aural settings for the diverse footage presented throughout the film, but also aptly sets the pace for the fast succession of synched images.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4PRgEoXvoK9mmNh5uWXpj1xwh0v.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Doppler Effect Version II","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
