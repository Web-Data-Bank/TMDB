His refusal, although he does not know it, harms the organizers of a demonstration against the communist cruelty, since his concert had been chosen like slogan.

Meanwhile, communist repression in the streets provokes the anger of the Hungarian people and gives rise to a real revolution.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vITRjGgYLj6VnbS0AUooWwcfEdM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1851,"logo_path":null,"name":"Isasi P.C.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1957-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rapsodia de sangre","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
