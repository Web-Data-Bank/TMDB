Mirco Kuball: an ultra-wealthy, flamboyant, sophisticated and outspoken man who just happens to have down’s syndrome. This touching film explores an unexpected life. It moves through the castle where he lives; the massage parlours and restaurants where he's indulged; and the theater where he performs. But, beneath the opulent showman, lies a man like any other, who realises that beyond shelter, food, and companionship, nothing else counts.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6NC1NnueQvHvsmZHdpx7DsyfX85.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2016-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Great Fortune","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
