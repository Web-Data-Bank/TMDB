The zany antics include the misadventures of a voyeuristic nurse, an exhibitionistic patient, a doctor and nurse who engage in S&M, a hypochondriac, and a lesbian nurse who sleeps with the patients.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/jMgkUto5gyhCS8WIpOCmM38zZ6R.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74931,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shishi Production","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1994-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sick People","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2}
