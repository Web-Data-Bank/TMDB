On a red train, he feels the massacre of the Tamils instigated by the Pro-Sinhalese majoritarian government. Now a filmmaker, he takes the same train from South to North. As he advances, the traces of the violence of the 26-year-old war and the one which turned the Tamil's fight for freedom into a self-destructive terrorism pass before his eyes. Reminiscing the hidden souvenirs of fighters and Tamil Tigers, he unveils the repressed memories of his compatriots, opening the door to a new era and making peace possible again. DEMONS IN PARADISE is the result of ten years of work. For the first time, a Tamil documentary filmmaker living in Sri Lanka is seeing the Civil war from the inside.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/scR8CdvtNK80mjX6XD7E3JWQiVi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Demons in Paradise","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
