Along the way, from the markets of Cairo to the temple of Karnak, we meet dancing girls and acrobats, magicians, fortune-tellers and even mystics performing an exorcism. The programme culminates in the rhythms of Flamenco, in the gypsy caves of the Alhambra, where some of Spain’s foremost gypsy families celebrate their history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3bpJJxEP6wNFNF6x7M86BMLPq0k.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beats of the Heart: The Romany Trail Part One: Gypsy Music into Africa","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
