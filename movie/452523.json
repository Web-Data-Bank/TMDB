Dispatched to the treacherous deserts of Gauda Prime, Lieutenant Sharp and his unit must find and destroy the enemy's central weapon, the dreaded Ma'har dream machine.  The obstacles are daunting- giant mutated creatures and an army of zombified sand troopers stand between the unit and their objective.
