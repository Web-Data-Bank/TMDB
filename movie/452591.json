Careless of her rural property, she lived by night countless adventures. From one such nights in the arms of a stage and movie producer, she begot her dear Lilás. Alas, six minutes after birth, the boy was taken from her and declared dead - due to the intrigue of the producer, who didn't want to recognize the child as his. Taken into custody by a surrogate mother, twenty years after the child grew into a man, who starts his education in the very fado (folk song, also meaning destiny) tavern where his real mother is. Beladona is still an attractive woman - and drama is round the corner.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tCAsAFdaQ8wjs5Gz9f8Y8m32ZT9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8492,"logo_path":"/wYhNCpXIThYDXevad6n90vsMXZ2.png","name":"RTP","origin_country":"PT"},{"id":20711,"logo_path":null,"name":"Doperfilme","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"1987-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"O Querido Lilás","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
