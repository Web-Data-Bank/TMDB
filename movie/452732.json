Director Alister Barry's perspective is clear, as he trains a humanist lens on â€˜Rogernomics' to argue for the policy's negative effects on society, as a new poverty-stricken underclass developed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9pzb52UmlsjarlikL51gEzoBzp6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53764,"logo_path":null,"name":"Community Media Trust","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"2002-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In a Land of Plenty","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
