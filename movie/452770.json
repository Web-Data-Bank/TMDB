Paradoxically, this attempt to incorporate Luxembourg into the Third Reich triggered the nation's self-awareness. Using mostly unseen archive footage, the film tells the story of the clash between ideologies: the Nazi vision of a 'German' Luxembourg, colliding violently with the idea of an independent Grand Duchy. For a people who where becoming aware of their national identity, this was a huge cultural shock. The emotional backbone of the film rests on the many testimonies of the people who lived through that tragic period.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bEa4x5fQfEEWjGyIopKbGMPlTZM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Letzeburgesch","iso_639_1":"lb","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heim ins Reich","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
