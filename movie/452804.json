Heinrich von Kleist / Robert Walser. Contiguous. They talk about imagination. Walser imagines Kleist, Kleist nobody, but Penthesilea.  In the new desert islands that are the enclaves of flowers of the city. Roses of sidewalks. Wild spaces with anonymity, truncated and without paths, in the banal stones of any career, inscribe and break the voices of an abrupt literary, hermetic and arid fragments in the image of places, almost no of place.  Images figures of writing. In the blind corner. Without access.  Very few signs.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u97cjJbKw9V31j6FeiKtH6UwfVk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1993-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kleist","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
