Crossed stories, mixed times, memories and inventions.  Coming from the voices encountered. They look like text like sisters. They are the voices of memory, the shadows cast by the characters, the voices of girls, the voices of indecision and evocation.  We begin with this work: to read, to record (in analog, it takes breath).  Here comes a place, a place found: the foliage of a vine in the South, crossed by the wind Mistral: a landscape.  Where are we? Where the boy dies, would we see what he sees? Where was the child playing in the neighborhood? At the heart of the narrative, at the heart of the written word?  That would happen.  Harvesting images, shifting gears, Multiplying the generations with the listening of the voices, even in memory sometimes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1ZCHZf9dagkLj4xitdYBhAcRU3f.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Passages","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
