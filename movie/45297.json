Recently voted \"America's Favorite House DJ - 2006\" by the readers of BPM Magazine (an award which he also won in 2003), Bad Boy Bill has again reasserted his place at the forefront of American clubbing. With Bill's reputation built upon his phenomenal live sets which incorporate extravagant visuals and live dance performances in addition to Bill's fierce turntable prowess, it was only logical for Bill to release his first ever live performance audio/visual set in the form of 'Behind the Decks LIVE.' This CD + DVD release includes the live DJ mix set PLUS a DVD with over 2.5 hours of exclusive multi-media content including the Dolby 5.1 &amp; DTS Surround live DJ mix concert, behind the scenes features, exclusive visuals, interviews &amp; more. Packaged in a deluxe digipack with a 12 page tour booklet.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Behind the Decks LIVE","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
