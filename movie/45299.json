Discussing an issue the BBC calls \"as fierce as ever,\" the two go head to head in a remarkable match of intellect. Holding the Atheistic position is Prof. Richard Dawkins, celebrated author of The God Delusion and regarded by many as the spokesman for the \"New Atheism.\" Opposing Dawkins is fellow Oxford professor John Lennox.
