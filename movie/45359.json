So they chainsaw a cadaver’s arm off and use the severed arm as a prop in a horror film. Now they have to survive a night in the graveyard with a cadaver zombie that wants his arm back! Pot smoking slacker gravediggers, a movie goddess (Lar Park Lincoln, Friday the 13th Part 7), an obsessed movie mogul, a cadaver salesman, hot cheerleaders who may be exotic dancers, a redneck who would love to grill a severed arm and a horny Scottish Terrier - they’re all here in this over-the-top horror film for stoners that has been called the most ominous use of a severed arm in the history of celluloid.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6BmR2y98V9qsK9HNOiKuVIgseCq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Finally.
