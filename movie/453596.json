When the people do not forget his promise, Mengen ends up persuading the prime minister to visit the town with his idiosyncratic methods. After consulting with his advisors, Peker prepares a grandiose welcome ceremony, but when the ceremony gets out of his control, the town of 5000 people suddenly ends up becoming a country, one that is at war with America. As Peker Mengen, his unwillingly married wife Mualla and his advisors try to keep America at bay and struggle with the difficulties of establishing a new country, they even get the help of an alien to achieve their goals.","popularity":3.13,"poster_path":"/c9q47mJP24LdY4fPmRMAmhnO51h.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25350,"logo_path":"/cVSmWXOANMlHpDObhi2nOJ83PDf.png","name":"BKM","origin_country":"TR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"2017-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Overnight Republic","video":false,"vote_average":5.369,"vote_count":42}
