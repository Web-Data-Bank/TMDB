Each car not only runs on tracks but also has a set of tracks over its top, permitting an oncoming car to go over it. The camera was placed close to a platform on which the passenger-laden train ran, and the over-and-under vehicle demonstrated its unusual capabilities several times.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1905-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Leap Frog Railway, Coney Island","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
