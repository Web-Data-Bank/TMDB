A director (Trajkov) has grown weary of battling his producer for control of his latest project and decides to hit the road, borrowing his girlfriend's auto and stealing the production bankroll from the project's financiers. While at first the director claims to have a grand scheme for his ill-gotten gains, his plans take a serious left turn when he meets a strange young woman and an eccentric hitchhiker.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1kEhVSrQiZ1IG6tqfwIaEMgcfk1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94674,"logo_path":null,"name":"In/Out","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":54760,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kaval Film","origin_country":"MK"},{"id":94675,"logo_path":null,"name":"World Circle Foundation","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","name":"Macedonia"},{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2007-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Macedonian","iso_639_1":"mk","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Movie - An Introduction to the Philosophy of Auteur Film Making","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
