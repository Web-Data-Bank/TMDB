It gives the complete trip from the station at the New York City end of the bridge to the station at the Brooklyn end, as seen from the front end of a third rail car running at high speed. The entire trip consumes three minutes of time, during which abundant opportunity is given to observe all the structural wonders of the bridge, and far distant river panorama below.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sy6jyrBHgGfWXl5ULPJdaKFpZ8q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1899-05-22","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Across Brooklyn Bridge","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":3}
