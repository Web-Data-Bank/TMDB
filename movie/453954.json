The sheer uncertainty about the future pushes folks to cling on to their daily habits while trying to get along with the ever-shifting political landscape. A wide array of wildly diversified characters try to cope as good as they can with the hardships in their town. A death metal band keeps rehearsing daily. A teacher guides visitors through the story of the city. The wonders of a vibrating armchair are tested as a tool against stress and anxiety. An elderly lady who has lost her son tries to talk some sense into her fellow citizens urging them to accept peace.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bR14hAnVp5DKUkCwP1im0NUKFpk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2020-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Long Echo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
