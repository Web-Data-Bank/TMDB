A riveting historical document as well as cautionary commentary on power vacuums, racism and civil society apathy, SILHOUETTE CITY prefigures the so-called “alt right” forces that now rally around Trump as their emboldening metropole.  This history is troubling enough to be fiction, but in fact, this is the factual story of one faction of American fascism and its rise to the mainstream.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mQeUL2eA5nHYyuSXGlzsIlSk48.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Thy kingdom come...
