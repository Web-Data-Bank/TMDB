The “Tute Bianche” were the white-clad Italian activists who used their bodies – protected by foam rubber, tires, helmets, gas masks, and homemade shields – in direct acts and demonstrations as weapons of civil disobedience. The Tute Bianche first appeared in Italy in 1994 in the midst of a social setting in which the “mass laborer,” who had played a central role in the 1970s in production and in labor struggles, was gradually replaced in the transition to precarious post-Fordist means of production. “Disobbedienti” thematizes the Disobbedienti’s origins, political bases, and forms of direct action on the basis of conversations with seven members of the movement.","popularity":0.711,"poster_path":"/rJbNKmUgUrmzcxTg49DIYXivvMI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":132281,"logo_path":null,"name":"Oliver Ressler Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2002-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Disobbedienti","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":4}
