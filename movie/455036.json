A nod of the head, which seems treacherous in its mechanical repetition, meets the profile of a bearded man who does not appear to react at all in a suggested counter shot. The slight flickering of the image further intensifies the impression of an illicit agreement, of witnessing a crooked handshake. The ringing of the unseen telephone and the constant ticking of a clock lend the events a limited temporality. Something is running out, and in doing so, is also already reaching its end, a ghostly final act, which is anticipated by an explosion and breaks off with the sound of a falling guillotine.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/txjTwIRCS9Owt9emfSKYBDsZTSC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89667,"logo_path":null,"name":"TMM Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2017-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hallo Mabuse","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
