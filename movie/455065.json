Of the 97 people on board (36 passengers, 61 crew), there were 35 fatalities; there was also one death among the ground crew. The actual cause of the fire remains unknown, although a variety of hypotheses have been put forward for both the cause of ignition and the initial fuel for the ensuing fire. The incident shattered public confidence in the giant, passenger-carrying rigid airship and marked the end of the airship era.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8tfspAgkMoW8gNzqUgWrEXi5Ere.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21772,"logo_path":null,"name":"Castle Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1937-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hindenburg Explodes!","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
