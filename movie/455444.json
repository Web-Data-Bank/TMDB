Martha is from France, Yasmin from Germany, Jamie from the U.S. and Sam from Cameroon. They sit in their kitchen, cook for each other and dance together. But, compared to his flatmates, Sam left his country, because he needed to take refuge. The camera subtly catches the inequity that evolves between the four characters. Club Europe is a film about millennials who want to act more supportive and altruistic than their parents and need to face the question how far they really want to go in order to help.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rkZHC4TlVFLRmaFOUdmsBSydCZ7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":296,"logo_path":"/kMFX59w5Sgxx9PVpV4k3ZgspRmz.png","name":"Filmakademie Baden-Württemberg","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2017-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Club Europa","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
