While the title character dreams of beauty, love and happiness, her dreams are broken by her encounter with men she meets(the men are portrayed as lusting objects, with the exception of the father) and ultimately shattered by her father. Beautifully told, through poetry and symbolism, director Anjan Das presents Tukun aka Saanjhbathi's world. Her world is also presented through her father's wonderful paintings from which she draws inspiration. Indrani Halder gracefully plays the title role with sincerity and maturity while Soumitra Chatterjee is sublime.","popularity":0.721,"poster_path":"/s6qlawzYN2T3SooedCogwrg0GjW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11151,"logo_path":null,"name":"Deep Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Saanjhbatir Roopkathara","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
