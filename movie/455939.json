Instead, he does the next best thing.  He meets the devil in a boiler room. And the devil’s a she. A very sexy she named Lucibel sans the traditional horns and pointy tail because \"that’s terribly passé, today its mod.\" Touched that Marvin is such a screw-up, she offers to help him but not, she says, because she wants his soul, but because she wants to make him happy. So she grants him a wish with no strings attached.","popularity":0.657,"poster_path":"/knCl6heGC8gDl22cIwYKCT2nMsj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To Hex with Sex","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
