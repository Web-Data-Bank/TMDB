The staged scenes are based on an original script by the artist and focus on the conversations of a married couple who work for the same food multinational – a cross between Nestlé and Monsanto. Their exchange is inspired by theatre and television, where socio-political analysis is played out through everyday, familial dialogue with large doses of humour, hypocrisy and violence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hVicMflddzUlSx3fK9v9LEHY6TX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mouthfeel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
