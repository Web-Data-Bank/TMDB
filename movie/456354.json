Elderly ladies rummage through jumble at a sale held by the Salvation Army in Glasgow. 'Jumble sales aren't part of the normal capitalist system, so it doesn’t look quite like a Western Europe in the 21st century. And the music also makes the viewer unsure when or where this is.’","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The States of Things","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
