Lavinia blames Garrett for sending her father Ivory White to jail for robbing 100,000 dollars. White, who has stashed the loot away someplace, is about to be released and plans to return the money to the express office for the sake of his children, Lavinia and Chad. Nasty Jim Judd forces Lavinia to help him rob the coach carrying Ivory and the money, counting on the fact that White will keep quiet for his daughter's sake.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sENb8TwfYUnVFKtEzKVqMImG88Y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1432,"logo_path":"/8AcaWEWQ8MFUBGlt9WxGGBAMpMG.png","name":"Republic Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1949-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Outcasts of the Trail","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
