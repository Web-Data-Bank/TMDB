How do you become what you are: a painter, a musician, an absolute artist? Europe was nothing but a ruin and shame possessed the heart of the young Germans. They needed to invent, scream, regain a lost brotherhood. Overcome this silence! That’s how some young German, British, Dutch, Belgian… musicians made Europe exist long before Maastrich and have kept on cherishing, imperturbably, their freedom! They are no longer twenty-year-olds, but others have followed. They set themselves one constraint: reinvent everything every time. A way to take the very instant into account, to let the unexpected in, to match to the world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3iFti4OYDyQirmx66euUTf0Bdqk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Soldier of the Road: A Portrait of Peter Brötzmann","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":4}
