About 50% of the video is the ritual itself, consisting of recitations from their unique liturgy interspersed with vintage hymns.  The text is read by original Process minister Sammy M Nasr and the songs are performed here by the band Sabbath Assembly (Jex Thoth, Imaad Wasif, Kevin Rutmanis and Dave Nuss - obviously taking their name from the ceremony itself).  Following the ritual is a slideshow presentation on the church narrated by original Process member/author Timothy Wyllie and finally a Q&A interview with Timothy conducted by Feral House publisher Adam Parfrey.  So while it's not a documentary exactly, you certainly learn about the history of the church, its practices, and get a good feel of what it was like to be a member.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p72gvqm2kNfoG908luZHmUqO0Al.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-08-23","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Process Church of the Final Judgement - A Sabbath Assembly Ritual and Salon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
