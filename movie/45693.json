The timeline, which proves to be accurate in all other respects, predicts that Amy should marry her seventh boyfriend. However, Amy must question her instincts when she feels that herÂ sixth boyfriend is the one she should marry, not the predicted seventh. Now she must decide whether to follow her mother's advice, or follow her own heart.","popularity":4.877,"poster_path":"/o4GCda5liUllqYpFS3UVfxSLhq2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1632,"logo_path":"/cisLn1YAUuptXVBa0xjq7ST9cH0.png","name":"Lionsgate","origin_country":"US"},{"id":28523,"logo_path":"/zzULw9w7d50BHR8fE30PZT3zJ1D.png","name":"Lionsgate Television","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-07-20","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Love doesn't always arrive on schedule.","title":"Lucky 7","video":false,"vote_average":5.807,"vote_count":57}
