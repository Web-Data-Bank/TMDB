They wanted to make The Years differently, and decided to record the album together, live, in the same space - Studio A of Electrical Audio in Chicago, Illinois. With the exception of limited overdubs, (vocals, drum ensembles and laptop atmospherics) each song represented one collective take, warmly captured to two inch analogue tape. This recording method embraced the mistake as much as the moment.  They also chose to document the making of the record with a film, appropriately titled, 'You Can't Rewind The Years'. With a new understanding and years of progress to come, these longtime friends are making the music that they'd always hoped to. As they sing, in The Years' standout track Restless, \"Not without trial, not without err - this brokenness is ours to share.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/liHk2jMBnOFubtePt2V2q0K9IMj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90186,"logo_path":null,"name":"Snaproll Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Documentary Film About The Years","title":"Urbanites - You Can't Rewind The Years","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
