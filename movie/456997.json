Erin Gray turns in a commanding, award-worthy\r performance with a portrayal that is disarming in its reality. Kent McCord portrays a man in\r profound conflict, reflecting the best and worst in all of us. Gary Conway's performance as\r artist/attorney, David Merritt, will invoke people to question their own unchallenged truths.\r Marshall Borden brings depth, style and humanity to his role of the inspired playwright.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Woman's Story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
