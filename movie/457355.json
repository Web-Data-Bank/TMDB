Not the typical history of a local music scene but so much more. Shot in an episodic format, the film contains over 60 interviews, never before seen footage, photos and a blazing soundtrack. With appearances by Roger Miret & Vinnie Stigma (Agnostic Front), Lou Koller, Craig Setari (Sick Of It All), Ray Cappo (Youth Of Today), Billy Graziadei (Biohazard), Billy Milano (S.O.D. / M.O.D.) and Mike Judge (Judge). The film addresses the community, culture, straight edge and DIY ethic of the hardcore scene in the greatest city in the world that is still vibrant, relevant and going strong to this day.","popularity":0.611,"poster_path":"/60JCRZJI4nJnBlwlJijymKcdvb6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115357,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stone Films NYC","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The New York Hardcore Chronicles Film","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
