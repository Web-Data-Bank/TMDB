Retrato de Classe starts from a photo of the junior class of a private school, in a middle class neighborhood of São Paulo. He searches for and gathers former colleagues and a teacher, in order to recreate the group's trajectories, to draw the profile of the country's metropolitan bourgeoisie. A country in crisis and a middle class that was experiencing the collapse of the economic miracle. Frustrations, desires, prejudice and futility are part of this universe of people and their life trajectories.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/35F6P2hoMW18QjMi1M1oCIVz2mr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"1977-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Retrato de Classe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
