After six years she is sent to London, where her name is changed, but her miserable life of servitude continues. Her passport is taken and she is told that her father will die if she goes to the authorities. Fortunately she meets a sympathetic person who seems to offer her the hope of escape and reunion with Bah ,back in Sudan. For all the film's optimism an end title states that there are around 5,000 'slave' workers currently in Britain.","popularity":2.128,"poster_path":"/wnHMN29omSLTUrRb12HVbO5HH8k.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Only hope can set you free","title":"I Am Slave","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":26}
