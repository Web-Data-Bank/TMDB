Ice-holes are the theme of the day, a winter tradition that unites believers and sportsmen, stars and walruses, the president and the unemployed.  In the centre of the news reports are the topics of Baptism, fishing and the criminal chronicle. The president and a pike, the artist and the crit- ics, the oligarch and the law enforcement team – they all meet at an ice- hole in search of solutions for their problems. The jobless Muscovite, with bad habits, dives down an ice-hole for a wife, just like Sadko. The fairy- tale plots intertwine with documentary context, and it is no longer clear where reality ends. Remember Nietzsche: if you long gaze into the abyss, the abyss will also gaze into you.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iiLMs3GKIPJCBdwMxI9JkFUoePg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":104333,"logo_path":"/oTC4dPr9QlQBk1Yyu2yG7eWFsMd.png","name":"Kosmosfilm","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2017-09-28","revenue":2475,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ice Hole","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
