The filmic wandering becomes a nostalgic and political reflection on territorial belonging and identity, and the roles we assume in the places we came from.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4kLzw4Lg67UX94DhEOTiBVQtuYc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19196,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blackmaria","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2017-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flores","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":9}
