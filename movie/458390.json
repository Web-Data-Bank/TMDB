Sugar also played a surprisingly critical part in America's battle for independence. Tour a sugar plantation on Maui, Hawaii to get an inside look at how cane sugar is produced today and learn how the sugar stalks are put through an extensive process of extraction and purification--and how a ton of harvested cane results in 200 pounds of raw sugar. Learn the technology behind creating the sweetener in all of its permutations, including corn syrup, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and cube sugar, and how it's used in candies, soda, and sauces as well as more exotic uses such as in pipe tobacco and processed meat.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ymC2T9AB9DKRn5EIOwS7Sb2YYXm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Modern Marvels: Sugar","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
