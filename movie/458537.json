The Fang of the Sun are a small team of guerillas fighting against Earth's occupation. To counter Earth's Combat Armors, they have a lone Combat Armor of their own: Dougram, a CA specially built for Deloyer's environment — and piloted by Crinn Cashim, the rebellious son of the leader of the Earth government on Deloyer.  This compilation film version presents the events of the 75 episode anime series as a documentary, primarily focusing on the story's politics rather than the main characters. Originally screened with the short \"Choro Q Dougram\" and the Combat Mecha Xabungle compilation film Xabungle Graffiti.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/7WY7LVSk4hkPqlDOMHtWJGalYvx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3153,"logo_path":"/yKZ9UarLSu9Y4Gpw33nKRQOPM7z.png","name":"SUNRISE","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1983-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Can you see the truth?","title":"Document: Fang of the Sun Dougram","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
