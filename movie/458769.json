Unfortunately, all they found was each other... In a last ditch effort to save their struggling relationship, the duo twist their couples' counseling therapy into a plot that would see them turning back into their Texas low-life roots as petty criminals. As has been the case throughout the history of Rick and Reni's calamity plagued relationship, their haphazard scheme to hold up a dive bar goes horribly wrong. When a diverse cast of bar patrons gets caught up in their failed plot, Rick and Reni begin to not only wonder if they'll survive the day, but if they can survive one another.","popularity":1.78,"poster_path":"/hcD0C38YTPv3ySQgD4XNKw8OEpd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90744,"logo_path":"/t4qyqjYSaqbU71V1fn0nmadtJSo.png","name":"Sweetbreadstudios","origin_country":"US"},{"id":90745,"logo_path":null,"name":"Buffalo Speedway Film Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"They might survive the heist.
