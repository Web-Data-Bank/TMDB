Working and growing together since 1993, their collaborations have produced unobtrusive yet elegant images that complement songs from across the band's discography. The DVD is a trim package with only nine videos in roughly 40 minutes, yet it excels as a document of thoughtful visual poetry, an evolving symbiotic relationship, and a convenient condensation of the group's achievements over the past decade [upon release]. In other words, Bareback can be appreciated for its visual and aural qualities, both independent of and in combination with each other.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/5QRrqk3pSGTBfARnL7ETr6WcGOH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90006,"logo_path":null,"name":"Warp Records","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2005-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tindersticks: Bareback","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":3}
