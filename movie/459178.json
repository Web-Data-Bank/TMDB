He begins with a 1987 US state department document invalidating US passports for travel to Lebanon. Then, we see walls marked by bullet holes, film students listening to a lecture and practicing scenes in a restaurant. Next, the camera visits a mental hospital in Fanar and an older man, holding his Koran, laments being a refugee within his own country. The camera then enters a nursery school. The colors of poetry are red and green; the cost of being Lebanese is to orphan one's children in order then to adopt them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Credits Included: A Video In Red And Green","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
