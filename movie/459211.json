Wild Bill Elliot plays gambler Frank Graham, who heads to Kansas in search of his father's murderer. This being 1864, the local military presence is more preoccupied with keeping Southern sympathizers out of the state to worry about Graham's problems. Thus, our hero undertakes the task of exposing the killer himself. As always, the least likely suspect is the guilty party (though sharp-eyed viewers were wise to the villain from the first reel). Marjorie Lord co-stars as Jane Dudley, the comely operator of the local freight line who helps Graham in his task. Producer Thomas M. Fennelly and director Thomas Carr later collaborated on the Richard Diamond TV series.","popularity":0.621,"poster_path":"/g2evYpv7v1yveCKPaOzGntnqFKz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4928,"logo_path":null,"name":"Allied Artists Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1953-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"His guns were loaded for one town... one man... one roaring moment of revenge!","title":"Rebel City","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
