In a short period of time, they are to create and oversee two monumental public art pieces – one in Montréal and the other in Toronto – and represent Canada during the 56th Biennale in Venice. What better moment than to shine the spotlight on this immensely creative trio and allowing us to take a retrospective look on their prolific and disconcerting legacy. This fairy-tale like documentary, entangles humour, extravagance, oneirism and camaraderie.","popularity":1.247,"poster_path":"/wSlKPXygaIhCab98pEF7zmGmqX6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":44810,"logo_path":"/fwnOlu3T5VrgVWruS7rck7tWprC.png","name":"Les Films du 3 Mars","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2017-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"BGL Fancy","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":5}
