In particular, the relationship with Christian imperialism and its impact on his tribe: the Ashanti.  Sunday’s Best considers how belief systems within the diaspora are inflected by these colonial histories in the present day. The work is a confluence of the vivid sounds and images of praise and worship sessions in a Ghanaian community church married with the stark interiors of a Roman Catholic Church. Documented across a number of sites in London, Sunday’s Best maps out a narrative of coming to terms with the incongruence of faith practices that straddle western and non-western influences.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sunday's Best","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
