His final piece, “The Komarovo Waltz”, unveiled here for the very first time, was written as a tribute to the place. The film is the reclusive composer’s eulogy to the community. It also serves as Karavoichuk’s farewell to audience as well as his last address and reminder of things that are truly important – love for your fellow man and virgin nature.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/upGr2GjTWkUhloWc2yDZXAw9Twf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95687,"logo_path":null,"name":"CineLab Production","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":110943,"logo_path":"/maE5Gc3ZeSwLufpBuju0Ygj5v7t.png","name":"Studio Ostrov","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Waltz","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
