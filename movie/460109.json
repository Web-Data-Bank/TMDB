These arenas are a popular attraction at travelling fairs, where the tickets are cheap and the crowds are plenty. Viewers watch the action from a metal platform above the pit, while the magic unfolds beneath themâ€”the riders, the cars, the bikes, the lights and the noise.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xaUNHBkH9iyofXlyttekGrUedK4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The men risking everything for the thrill of the ride","title":"Riders of the Well of Death","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
