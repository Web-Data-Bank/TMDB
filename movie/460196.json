During this time I was hosted by the Quatre Chemins Festival, whose collaborators became an important part of the project. Daphne Menard, appears in Nocturne singing a traditional Haitian song about a young man who goes off to buy coffee and is arrested by police. Guy Regis Junior's mother, an assiduous lottery player, describes her lottery dreams and the common system for deciphering their codes. Two young theater students, from ENARTS, Port-au-Prince's art school, rehearse a speech, written for the occasion.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2X3yC17R50KRJ7sQd8QRSiKHNgi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Haitian; Haitian Creole","iso_639_1":"ht","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nocturne","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
