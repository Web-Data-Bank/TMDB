His new \"un-orthodox\" housemates soon introduce him to Taqwacore: a hardcore, Muslim punk-rock scene that only exists out west. As the seasons change, Taqwacore influences the house more and more. The living room becomes a mosque during the day, while it continues to host punk parties at night. Ultimately, Yusef is influenced by Taqwacore too, as he begins to challenge his own faith and ideologies. 'The Taqwacores' deals with the complexities of being young and Muslim in modern-day America.","popularity":0.782,"poster_path":"/affsZYvNFwXpKPpYlcnUPdQwStQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":195648,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rumanni Filmworks","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-24","revenue":12839,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A powerful, original, and hilariously irreverent story of punk Islam in the USA and the discovery of oneself within the confines of religion.","title":"The Taqwacores","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":6}
