Empowered by this document, Germany invaded Poland on 1. September 1939. Two days later Britain and France declared war on Germany. The Second World War was on. Due to the territorial divisions of the secret annex protocol, Finland ended up the target of attacks lunched by the Soviet Union, first on 30. November 1939 (the Winter War) and then again on 25. June 1941 (the Continuation War). In spite of the harsh conditions and having to fight an overwhelming enemy, Finland managed to keep her independence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/beKKe7TcwkwhpIP8fRJA6m82RSP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91120,"logo_path":null,"name":"poptori oy","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2006-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Nordic War","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
