The video concerns the Onassis/Callas/Kennedy triangle explored from the point of view of six different cultures: Dutch, Mexican, Chinese, Japanese, Malay and Polish. Here Carri√≥n appropriates and experiments with the television genre of documentary. Each of the six interviewees recounts their love of Maria Callas and her music and their disgust at Onassis for leaving her for Kennedy. This video explores, deconstructs and critiques 'reality' as conjured up by the mass media. This is made all the more pertinent and effective by its insertion into mainstream television programming.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aristotle's Mistake","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
