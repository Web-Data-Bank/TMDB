Albeit a recent boom in tourism, the sparsely populated region still remains one of the poorest regions in Europe. The impressively photographed film reflects upon the eventful history of this land: It portrays farmers, who struggle to work the barren land; fishermen, who fight for their existence, and Ukrainians, who were once forced to relocate and now return to their old home in the East.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dqmsBxJG8VsJpPrsBBjOCfFTEYz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2005-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Schattenland - Reise nach Masuren","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
