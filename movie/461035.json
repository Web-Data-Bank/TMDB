Founded by aircraft pioneer Alfred Lawson, Lawsonomy advocates for economic reform and clean, communal living that transforms followers into a \"New Species\" that will benefit the human race either in this life or the next. Merle joined Lawson as a teenager and never looked back. His high school sweetheart Betty Kasch, however, is tired of Lawson coming between them. Reunited after over 60 years apart, non-believer Betty wants Merle to join her in Florida. Merle's commitment to preserving Lawson's legacy, artifacts currently rotting in a barn alongside a Wisconsin highway, has Betty worried Merle may leave her for Lawson once again.","popularity":1.169,"poster_path":"/p8FulZIGIdlWtLd04tGNAyEWq2C.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":137212,"logo_path":null,"name":"Threshing Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Good Reactions","title":"Manlife","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
