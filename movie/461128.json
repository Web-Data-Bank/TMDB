It's like a magnet that attracts trouble. And the fact that neighbors on the communal shamelessly \"survive\" her, and then her first lay off at the reduction in school, and even an unfulfilled personal life - in everything, Nina blames only her unhappiness.  Her friend Masha tries to prove to her that the problem is in Nina herself. She does not know how to stand up for herself and allows others to use her trustfulness.  Temporarily, Nina arranges an interpreter for one of the successful companies. There she gets acquainted with the director of the company Roman, who begins to look after her.  But Nina does not even realize that once again becomes a \"bargaining chip\" in someone else's game.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/i0WzCFOJRhZ1B8BcP5vFTHluTCE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unlucky","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
