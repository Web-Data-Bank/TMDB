Based on a manga by Naoki Yamamoto, the film follows Aochi, who sleeps and sleeps but never feels like she has slept enough. Shichiri, who explores the limits of sound and image in his diverse body of work, presents a highly evocative dramatic film in which humans barely appear on screen. The story is told through voiceover, sound and visions of dreams and landscapes. Over the years, the film has gained fans, including contemporary auteur Kiyoshi Kurosawa, who compared the film to those by Jean-Luc Godard. -JAPAN CUTS: Festival of New Japanese Film","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/d85afoxOTZOsY0LC2Zv4gDvgaLQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2017-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Once Upon a Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
