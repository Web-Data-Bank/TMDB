Kennedy","overview":"In 1969 New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison prosecuted only trial for the murder of John F Kennedy. Although the defendant, Clay Shaw, was acquitted, he committed perjury and the central charge, that he conspired to murder the President in his role as a CIA operative was given added weight when after his death it was admitted by the CIA that he worked for them. Garrison's case was the basis for the epochal film JFK by Oliver Stone which did more than any other medium before or since to shatter the facade carefully constructed by the Warren Commission and its sycophants. This film, a labour of love for multiple Emmy Award winner John Barbour is a damning indictment of the American Media for its crucifixion of both himself and Garrison. Like everything else connected with this case you the truth is only told by the dedicated and the independent. John's film shows that the establishment media is neither.","popularity":0.907,"poster_path":"/nY5KadW5WapJWiL4dGi4rf78asE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91211,"logo_path":null,"name":"John Barbour Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"American Media & The Second Assassination of John F.
