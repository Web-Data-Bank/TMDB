Narrated by William Shatner, and accompanied by a special digital \"surround\" recording of Antonio Vivaldi's The Four Seasons, the film takes audiences on a breathtaking trip through the eruption of spring, the growth of summer, the harvest and festivity of autumn, and the dormancy of winter. The beauty of the seasons is interspersed with a look at the earth as a planet, the sun as a star, and the human quest to understand the relationship between the two.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/40L4sqFmAKGxensc8F0Nv5aiTG9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1987-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seasons","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
