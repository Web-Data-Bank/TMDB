Hundreds more men and women from the area similarly lost their lives. At the site of the massacre now stands a museum and monument encouraging visitors to revisit this tragic period in Greek history and engage in conversation with the ghosts of the past. Based on the iconic performance titled Kokkinia, which was carried out on the site in 1979 by the late Maria Karavela (1938–2012), and her resulting censored film, Mary Zygouri stages a long-term project in close collaboration with the local community—and local ghosts—addressing the climate of economic and social crisis in Greece and throughout the world. Like Maria Karavela, Mary Zygouri presents the results of her work in a film during Documenta 14.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Round-up Project: Kokkinia 1979–Kokkinia 2017 \\ M.
