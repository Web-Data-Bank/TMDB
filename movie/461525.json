Together they created L'Arche, a commune at the edge of a beautiful forest near Paris. A quiet revolution was born. Now in his 80s, still at L'Arche and revered by some as a living saint, Jean has discovered something that most of us have forgotten - what it is to be human, to be foolish, and to be happy.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/sJ8X8gQRDzcRJ0JgJQ6pMkgxv9u.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Summer in the Forest","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
