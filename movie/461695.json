Corporations rule the world, and an agent is on a secret mission to explore the untold stories of the past. His journey leads him into a secret virtual reality where one corporation has recreated the 1980s, an era that witnessed the birth of video game development, an event in which a politically and economically restricted small European country, Hungary, had a significant role. He discovers a strange but exciting world, where computers were smuggled through the Iron Curtain and serious engineers started developing games. This small country was still under Soviet pressure when a group of people managed to set up one of the first game development studios in the world, and western computer stores started clearing room on their shelves for Hungarian products.","popularity":0.687,"poster_path":"/hukJJTflX7g7RYJKCPNDUAea49H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91642,"logo_path":null,"name":"Flame Film Bt.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"}],"release_date":"2017-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moleman 4: Longplay","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":3}
