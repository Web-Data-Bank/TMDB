Recalling the history of Morocco and those who tried in earnest to affect change, the experiential nature of the film allows for an interesting perspective on a common story and setting. This film is an allegory of memory: an erratic recollection of shared experiences, feelings, and thoughts that shape a coherent narrative.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thank God It's Friday","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
