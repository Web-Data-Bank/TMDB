With Paso Doble, Lambert graduates from the \"no budget\" to the low budget commercial film. But he maintains his wacky comi-pathos in a relatively straight narrative about a middle class couple who, after managing to ruin an idyllic vacation in Spain, embark on an extravaganza of sordid love affairs. Their teenage kids watch with raised eyebrows as Mom and Pop--played by underground stars Ulrike S. and Albert Heins--poignantly grope their way back to each other.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5Sq1IfHoJvw29ziZgAWD3Cd7MBF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paso Doble","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
