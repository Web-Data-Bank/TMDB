Over that time she was Nominated Best Newcomer 2007 and Best Female Comedy 2009 by the New Zealand Comedy Guild (where Diane was resident at the time).  Filmed at The Classic Comedy Bar, this show reveals the start of Diane’s style as a comic who takes events from her own life and turns them into well constructed sets packed with punchlines.  Originally titled “Tam Pom Pom” Diane re-named the show, taking the new title from a review.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Diane Spencer - Wit, Charm & Filth","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
