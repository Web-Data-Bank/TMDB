Besides brief historical localizations by a narrator, only contemporaries and Hitler himself speak: no interviews, no reenactment, no illustrative graphics and no technical gadgets. The testimonies from diaries, letters, speeches and autobiographies are assembled with new, often unpublished archive material. Hitler's life and work are thus reflected in a unique way in interaction with the image of the society in the years 1889 to 1945.","popularity":0.658,"poster_path":"/1ZqecGE9Nh3Uz268qwwz98uSrQe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134305,"logo_path":null,"name":"Epoche Media","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2017-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":191,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Who was Hitler","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
