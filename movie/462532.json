In the 20th century, only the Bible, the Koran and the Thoughts of Chairman Mao sold more. But they had fewer jokes, no pictures and were useless at important stuff like tying knots. In this entertaining and affectionate film, Ian Hislop uncovers the story behind the book which kick-started the Scout Movement - a work which is very eccentric, very Edwardian and very English. Hislop discovers that the book is also very radical and addresses a variety of modern issues, such as citizenship, disaffected youth and social responsibility. He explores the maverick brilliance of Baden-Powell, a national celebrity after his heroism in the Boer War, and considers the book's candid focus on health and well-being.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aAc0oQZVlWVW8iWreV9xKzfYdOz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Scouting for Boys","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
