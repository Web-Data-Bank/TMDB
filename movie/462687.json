There is piousness steeped in blind faith as they try to survive and in Ingo's unseeing eyes, even something beautiful atop the mountains. But as a newcomer to an established fiefdom, their uneasy foothold in the village collapses when Julio is involved in a murder incident. The one witness, an outcast thief, holds the key to Julio's ultimate fate.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xET8qO6jGYM9lwfMMerVwCWaO8X.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mountain Thief","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
