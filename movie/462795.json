The police are baffled; the town's inhabitants are panic-stricken. A serial killer is on the loose, and as yet more horrific murders take place, the search for clues becomes a desperate race against time. A tense psychological thriller with a chilling climax, this television movie introduced the charismatic, dedicated Welsh detective Noel Bain (Philip Madoc), a man with a passion for defending the innocent and an infallible instinct which the sharpest criminal minds cannot match. Also starring Hywel Bennett as Doctor Lewis, the feature-length drama won a BAFTA Cymru award and initiated the highly acclaimed, darkly authentic crime series which ran between 1997 and 2004.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/25g4P4Dw6ccaJbBpDcu3YkRHYww.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Welsh","iso_639_1":"cy","name":"Cymraeg"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Mind To Kill","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
