In both cities, Zhou concentrates on public spaces as collective experience, highlighting the areas and their occupants in washes of color, particularly the electric blue of LED light, which he contrasts with the surface of a third space, the toxic red run-off of a heavy metal mine in northern Guangdong province.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lSVRRdqNgCYksOTZLdjHHUqScvk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blue and Red","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
