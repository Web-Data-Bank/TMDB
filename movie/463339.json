But is its value misunderstood? The one-hour documentary explores how this much-maligned spoiler of the Australian summer is in fact a crime solver, healer, pollinator and street sweeper. We'd miss them if they were gone, yet we put huge amounts of energy into wiping them out. Is it time to call a truce? Directed by Tosca Looby and produced by Sally Ingleton, the amusing and intriguing film pays homage to a much-maligned invertebrate and the influence it has had on our world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rYeuhqs1few4PKq6EQXWHgend86.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91733,"logo_path":"/5o1nptgGnmGxdrYnIhntOqCupHm.png","name":"360 Degree Films","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2014-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"How a national nuisance helped shape Australia and its people.","title":"The Great Australian Fly","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
