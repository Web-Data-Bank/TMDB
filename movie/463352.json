Then you'll learn how to add the melody to your chord strums to create lead solo arrangements for a variety of familiar songs. By the time you're finished, you'll learn hammer-ons, pull-offs, slides, tablature, rhythm patterns, arpeggiated rhythm, endings, and more.  Bass and rhythm guitar accompaniment is provided for songs at normal speed and at a slower speed so you can play along.
