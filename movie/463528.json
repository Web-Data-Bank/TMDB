Through the stories of these young men and women who were at the forefront of these efforts, Agents of Change examines the untold story of the racial conditions on college campuses and in the country that led to these protests.  Agents of Change links the past to the present and the present to the past--making it not just a movie but a movement.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/z8u4nvohzc8uSCdn0rzak8H7Ohh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Agents of Change","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
