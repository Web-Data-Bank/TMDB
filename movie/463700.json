By 1954 the Himalayan Mountaineering Institute (HMI) was founded to marry the high-altitude strengths of the Sherpa with technical climbing skills.  The HMI’s arduous training program has been developing mountaineers who play crucial roles in the success of Himalayan ascents. In 1967, HMI’s field director Nawang Gombu, a Sherpa and the first man to summit Everest twice, was charged with training women as well. In Sherpa: the Proving Grounds we follow a team of intrepid young women as they attack the grueling 28-day course.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4HRmBBmcIKEamrvrdc5YWiRXmVk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sherpa: The Proving Grounds","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
