Weber shot Mitchum in 35mm and 16mm black and white, hanging with friends and cronies in restaurants and hotel rooms and singing before a microphone at Capitol Records, recording standards for a projected album. When Mitchum passed away in 1997, Weber parked his beloved project and it was some time before he went back into his footage, picked up the camera again to continue, and complete, his tribute to Mitchum.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jZ8Dy2Z7RhWYoHMh1Aw4k1MSr0h.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nice Girls Don't Stay for Breakfast","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
