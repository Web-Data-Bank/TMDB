At 13, his life changed: through a series of visions, Dawa acquired the gift of telling the epic story of Tibetâ€™s King Gesar. Now, at 35, Dawa receives a salary from the government as a guardian of national cultural heritage and is regarded as a holy man by his community. When an earthquake reduces his hometown to rubble, redevelopment of the region takes a giant leap forward. In the midst of such seismic shifts, Dawa seeks healing from King Gesar and other divine protectors of the land.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/t6EhkXrevE8wCFAtYV7wNvBQmh3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92001,"logo_path":null,"name":"alive mind","origin_country":""},{"id":39134,"logo_path":"/sijjN3vMtjCnc1LkCM7HSBErcO3.png","name":"Kino Lorber","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tibetan","iso_639_1":"bo","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Young nomad Dawa's life was transformed at age 13 when a series of visions led to his remarkable gift for telling the epic tale of Tibet's King Gesar.","title":"A Gesar Bard's Tale","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
