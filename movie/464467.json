All attempts fail as fate sends her car swerving right into Sisi Sickles, a recently evicted 40-something promiscuous waitress. Seeing an opportunity for a quick buck, Sisi hastily begins to take advantage of naive Deb and is soon at Deb's doorstep with a \"broken umbilical cord or two.\" Stricken with guilt, a clueless and lonely Deb postpones her self-destructive plans to take care of Sisi. Things run hilariously amok when the two women grow closer and develop the only real friendship either of them has ever had.
