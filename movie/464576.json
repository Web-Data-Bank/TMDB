In the center of weapon-related innovations stood - at latest since the wars in emplaced and fortified positions, beginning in the 20th century - the mobility. The invention of the fighting tank has made possible a high grade of movability, and determined the result of World War 1. The \"blitz\" wars at the beginning of World War 2 were possible only by combined deployment of modern tanks and a superior air force. Analyzing of important tank battles stresses the importance of technical standards, of tactical deployment, as well as the high commitment of the tank crews. Films in colour and black and white, partly never seen before, will show for the first time the development of the German Tank Forces from the years of 1914 until 1945 in a comprehensive way.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mODJd4Fx7lNlkOcagylzh2tbaC1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5228,"logo_path":null,"name":"Polar Film   Medien GmbH","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2002-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"History of the German Tank Forces 1914-1945","title":"History of the German Tank Forces 1914-1945","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
