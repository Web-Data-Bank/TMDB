A struggle for acceptance into a civilisation in fertile, promised lands they found using an antique map, after crossing the desert... Now, all they need to do is to pass a test: four stakes and a limitless area they will enclose within these stakes. The only rule is they should take off with dawn, and return to the first stake as the sun sets. Critically encompassing the good and the evil, capitalism and communal life, and even people who were forced to leave their homes due to ongoing wars, and refugee problems, Nomad captures its audience at the heart of the film: the relationship between a father and his son.","popularity":1.242,"poster_path":"/t3Mxx6iNB75puzJSiNwJL6ElWXc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nomad","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
