The initial release is a modest success but the work becomes a massive hit after a real life murder takes place that bears a striking similarity to Hannah's story.

And is he going to strike again once Hannah releases her next chapter?","popularity":3.303,"poster_path":"/bx5SewDf5H82zqlVRZFgicsVPGv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13404,"logo_path":"/4F5RxvJgbVT0vFQHs3IYRPfJvo3.png","name":"Incendo Productions","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2017-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Serialized","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":48}
