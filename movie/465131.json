The work consists of three short sections intended to represent what is “playing” in each of the theaters. These include richly layered montages of the Old West and pop-culture imagery, as well as art and film celebrities who appear as phantom stand-ins to embody the specters of the Cowboy and of Sarah Winchester herself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Century 21","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
