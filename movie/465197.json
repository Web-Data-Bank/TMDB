But signs in ice’s cyclical patterns and its biodiversity have become worrying. Connected to the planet’s global ecosystem via atmospheric circulation and ocean currents, this white haven is suffering the effects of human activities. To document and explain what is unfolding in Antarctica, photographer, diver, and marine biologist Laurent Ballesta and photographer of extreme environments Vincent Munier will be blending their artistic perspectives of a rapidly changing continent. Laurent will tackle technical and human prowess below the ice to bear witness to its remarkable underwater life. His photographs will advance knowledge on Antarctica’s unique and little-known biodiversity. On land, his eye riveted to the lens of his camera, Vincent captures snapshots of life in an Emperor Penguin colony.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tkIpc2BVx74HMcBZ4cYAyO7scbg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13542,"logo_path":"/sJ0R9LDMGR5ildYS4GMhQcbKJVD.png","name":"CNRS Images","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":86958,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wild Touch Production","origin_country":""},{"id":86959,"logo_path":null,"name":"Andromède Océanologie","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":11010,"logo_path":"/lYQDiCx6qUJbatstiq51JHl6hbg.png","name":"Paprika Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2016-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An ode to the biodiversity and protection of the white continent","title":"Antarctica, in the footsteps of the Emperor","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
