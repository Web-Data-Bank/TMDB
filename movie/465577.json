The Washington-based CITES treaty, in which Japan participates, puts a limit on the number of warships any country can possess. As a result, Japan has to decommission a ship to its makers' disappointment. An institute of technology's laboratory designs a new ship. Due to less ships, sailors have to retire and are also disappointed. The laboratory's manager and an admiral are visiting a patient at a hospital and meet coincidentally. The former has a daughter who worries about her father's workload. She asks him to accompany her to a concert. Father has little time, but is convinced for her sake. He is inspired for a ship's design at the performance. The film is inspired by the life of Jo Hiraga.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nMfgRcYVnuRezLBgJSWueXX8qOk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":882,"logo_path":"/iDw9Xxok1d9WAM2zFicI8p3khTH.png","name":"TOHO","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1944-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cruel Sea","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
