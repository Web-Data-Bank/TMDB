Adorno famously taught. It shows two conservators scraping the walls of a lecture hall, looking for the legendary grey that Adorno had his classroom painted in order to promote concentration. The excavation is staged as a film set: the technical apparatus of the production is exposed and Steyerl’s directions for the excavators can be heard off camera. The video returns to an image of a camera being set up to take a photo of the lectern.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nIzp5oPWezchS2ovXc1ZnpLVq3o.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Adorno's Grey","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
