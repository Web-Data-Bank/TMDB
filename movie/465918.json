The result is a diverse, assertive collage, ranging from advice on how to seduce a librarian( in silence, of course), to the importance of short hair in visibly proclaiming your lesbianism and deafness: plus an essential beginner's guide to sexual signing. Shot entirely in British Sign Language with subtitles for the hearing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":92332,"logo_path":null,"name":"Frameline","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1992-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Actions Speak Louder Than Words","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
