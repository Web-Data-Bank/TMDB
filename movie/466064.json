From the many colourful and interesting players in this game to the magical landscapes of the Peak District National Park, this film portrays the essence of a scene which is often bewildering, frustrating and satisfying all rolled into one.  Using footage gathered over two winters it includes a diverse range of stories set to an awesome soundtrack. Highlights include Ben Moon's first ascent of Voyager (8b) followed by fifteen year old protege Tyler Landman's second ascent. Also featuring Sam Whittaker, Jerry Moffatt, Jon Fullwood, Ben Bransby, Adam Long and many more..  Winter Sessions is a feast for the eyes and ears as these climbers set about repeating old classics (The Ace, The Joker, Deliverance to name but a few) and establishing new instant classics.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zo9OYjYeFx8qvczZXxJpuKQBR2f.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92362,"logo_path":null,"name":"crabstix","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Peak Bouldering Film","title":"Winter Sessions","video":true,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
