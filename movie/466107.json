The tape opens with an idyllic representation of the Midwest and shifts into an expressive exploration of experiences within the narrow confines of a Midwestern moral code. The melodrama follows five main characters who find themselves together in a small motel; Crab, an agoraphobe, is employed as a clerk in the motel and lives at home with his family; Swallow, a recently escaped con and his lover, Jack; Katch, a woman dishonorably discharged from the military and her lover, Joy.\r The market place is a central focus for all the main charaters; as a place of potential employment, a site of crisis in representation, the public arena where the status quo is policed and, ultimately, a closed barrier whereby the \"norm\" is protected.","popularity":1.209,"poster_path":"/41lpBnpRVhMWLUXEGTUdppWIp2p.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88516,"logo_path":null,"name":"VTape","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1992-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Agora","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
