Viktor himself was abandoned by his own father, his mother then committed suicide, and he was left to grow up in an orphanage. Years later, his errant dad returns, now a disabled felon, and Viktor discovers a timely legacy is in the offing – his father’s apartment. The documentation for securing dad’s move into an old people’s home is signed in a flash. Nevertheless, the only one that can take him is miles away and, what’s more, the invalid starts to recuperate during the journey, which is when their real problems begin.","popularity":2.596,"poster_path":"/sdVwyVm5C9Fk5yEn2u0lFVSZbYZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15188,"logo_path":"/n7AUAGLkqNxSDN4ARh01jeacQKT.png","name":"VGIK","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2018-03-23","revenue":95589,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How Viktor \"The Garlic\" Took Alexey \"The Stud\" to the Nursing Home","video":false,"vote_average":6.962,"vote_count":53}
