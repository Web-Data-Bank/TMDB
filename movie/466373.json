The young manager Carrie, who wants to lead the house to new splendor, has to realize this as well. That's why she worries a lot when she realizes that she is pregnant. What will her financier and life partner Sam say about this? As a newspaper publisher, he has his hands full trying to dissuade bestselling author Alexia White from suing for defamation: one of his employees accused her of plagiarism. The writer has it in her hands to financially destroy him and Carrie. Carrie's jealousy and the pressure from his bank don't make Sam's negotiations with the woman whose honor has been violated any easier.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/biLyXGn8CcK4srKYwMiq4HCXAbE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2005-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rosamunde Pilcher: Magic of Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
