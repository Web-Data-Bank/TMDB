A man stripped bare of all modern values lives in a pure form, like a beast, feeding and satiating his every primal desire whenever they may arise. He takes on a mate, a woman intrigued by his personage or lack thereof, and they live in his den in central Tokyo. As time goes on, we see how this animal clashes with modern man, and the consequences of their coexistance.","popularity":0.633,"poster_path":"/tYuy7LBybyWAVXh6OgqCINZBUzN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13260,"logo_path":null,"name":"Directors Company","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":13832,"logo_path":null,"name":"Joy Pack Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1982-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wolf: Running Is Sex","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
