The camera shakes, gets in and out of focus, and we donâ€™t exactly know what is happening. At first this is a strange disorientation, but then you get used to it through the cyclical mechanical noise that joins the images. The words of a peaceful female voice allows you to frame the film: a visual exercise after all can also be free.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This Is Not an Olive Tree","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
