It generated a whirlwind of publicity and controversy at the time, not only as a federally-funded social experiment, but also as one of the last pioneer movements in America. The Matanuska Colony isn't just a fascinating footnote to the history of Alaska. It encompasses the despair of the Depression, the creative energy of the New Deal, the adventure of pioneering in Alaska, and the best and worst of our government and ordinary citizens in facing those extraordinary challenges.","popularity":1.342,"poster_path":"/ddxmxyCSC9NFaaC03ABUCJgLqtR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92519,"logo_path":null,"name":"Juster Hill Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The New Deal Pioneers of the Matanuska Colony","title":"Alaska Far Away","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
