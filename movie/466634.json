When that happens the ordinary world becomes extraordinary-- the magic of the universe is within each moment and act perceived in as many levels as we can contain. Nothing Happened This Morning attempts to capture this state of unconsciousness in the first twenty minutes of an ordinary--extraordinary morning.","popularity":0.621,"poster_path":"/dY2uDcShEAgYXsOo2A5gRqMLykq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1965-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nothing Happened This Morning","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
