Treacherous crime syndicates collide in a psychic, ballistic, paranormal, nuclear battle for an ancient Chinese coin that holds the blood rights to Hong Kong. Red-headed bad*ss Lens is called upon to retrieve the magical coin before the back-stabbing, double-crossing, two-timing, generally seedy events that follow get him killed...again.  With a loving tip of the hat to John Woo, Sam Raimi's Evil Dead trilogy, and the cyber-punk chaos of Shinya Tsukamoto's Tetsuo The Iron Man, director Steinauer unleashes the first cult masterpiece of the milennium.","popularity":0.841,"poster_path":"/l9CHyyAglneYMybHIvW3m6mcv1o.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ozark Savage","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
