When the egotistical Fred Graham mounts a musical adaptation of The Taming of The Shrew (with himself as director, producer, and star) he’s got the perfect leading lady in mind: his movie star ex-wife! The fireworks both onstage and off between the two seem destined to explode the entire production…or will a romantic flame that’s Too Darn Hot be rekindled?  With backstage shenanigans, gangsters brushing up their Shakespeare, and a collection of Porter tunes that any Tom, Dick, or Harry will love, Kiss Me, Kate remains an all-time favorite of musical fans from Padua to Peoria.","popularity":1.178,"poster_path":"/rwizsnSV18Z18TaIzDeghOMKoQw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39477,"logo_path":"/hfXGuDnuVFOYJVfw83fJvGUtt5O.png","name":"KQED","origin_country":"US"},{"id":15505,"logo_path":"/3MuBcEqLa5QRkZTpXBLzyk9zOmO.png","name":"NHK","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":21277,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Performance Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2003-02-26","revenue":0,"runtime":144,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Showmance Must Go On!","title":"Kiss Me Kate","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":5}
