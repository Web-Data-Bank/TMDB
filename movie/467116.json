This is his first and only documentary, dealing with his feelings about the first war he covered - the first Chechen war - as well as his very cynical view of Russian society during this time. These feelings and opinions were shared by many other war correspondents and cameramen at the time. The author used heavily contrasting footage and sound to illustrate his point of the indifference of 90's/early 2000's Russian society towards the conflicts it found itself in after the Second World War.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/iLntSpZTNGEc7H1aumsuKfHaMpf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92646,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ровитич","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"1999-06-03","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cursed and Forgotten","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
