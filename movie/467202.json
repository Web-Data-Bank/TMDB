From re-enacting the arrival of the First Fleet and the birth of John Macarthur's wool-producing enterprise, the film then turns to the present, focusing on rural production, industrial efficiency and the splendid urban landscape of Sydney. As the introductory title grandly proclaims: \"From so small a beginning has sprung the virile Australian Nation.\" Frank Hurley, at the peak of his fame as a photographer, film maker and adventurer, was the obvious choice to direct the film and he delivered spectacular imagery and patriotic commentary with gusto.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5Cdy5ByOF4J3tOUo6LIxSZTjm7J.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1938-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Nation is Built","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
