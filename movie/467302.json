For over 150 years this Scottish castle has been home to royal traditions of picnics, stag hunting and kilts. From prime ministers to Princess Diana, life at this tartan-bound holiday home has not appealed to everyone.  But there is another story of Balmoral, of how the royal family has played a role in shaping modern Scotland and how Scotland has shaped the royal family. Queen Victoria's adoption of Highland symbols, from tartan to bagpipes, helped create a new image for Scotland. Her values, too, helped strengthen the union between Scotland and England. Ever since, Balmoral has been a place that reflects the very essence of the royal family.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/251JP4W9EBqLLalFz89ULiElWyt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Balmoral","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
