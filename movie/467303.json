But what we have lived with ever since is a mirage, a mass hallucination, a fantasy. Why I Hate the Sixties examines the truth behind the myth. It suggests that we were living on borrowed time - we partied as Britain lost an empire and slid into unchecked industrial decline. Archive footage and contributors of all political stripes build the case against the decade where dreams turned to nightmares.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ii6X9HbDpFnD7zZgnPTdXgJlBCL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Why I Hate the 60s: The Decade That Was Too Good to Be True","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
