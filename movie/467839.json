Future spring-breakers on board are excited to be touring through space with some of the world’s elite. However, a sudden meteor storm smashes into the hull, and a deadly biological alien life form is let loose on the ship.  Seeking a suitable host, the retrovirus successfully merges with some the passengers, transforming them into seemingly invincible predators with the “touch of death”. As the ship is destroyed, the surviving passengers crash on a remote planet, and they learn that one of them is “infected”. They must quickly band together before it has a chance to slaughter them all.","popularity":13.49,"poster_path":"/blREOd05hyvbiA3Qc6BqCJ7unvC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6765,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sterling Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":86530,"logo_path":null,"name":"Girls and Corpses","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Hunt Begins","title":"Predator World","video":false,"vote_average":4.861,"vote_count":18}
