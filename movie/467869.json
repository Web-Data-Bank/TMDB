The players were, and are, household names – Barassi, Skilton, Jesaulenko, Davis, Hart, Nicholls, Mann, Dugdale, Fraser. Most didn’t own passports. Most had barely been out of Victoria. Ex-umpire and media juggernaut Harry Beitzel was the man who made it happen. He mortgaged his house. He organised the opponent. He flew his team of champions on a milk run to Darwin, Hong Kong, Paris, Dublin, London, New York and beyond to plant the seed of international competition. The Galahs is a rare feature film that reconnects fans with all time greats of both VFL and GAA football.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/36RpbjWYNlnr5RycaCU8Da5TtJs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6827,"logo_path":null,"name":"Madman","origin_country":""},{"id":176991,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sepia Tones","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2016-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Galahs","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
