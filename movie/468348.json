The base is one of few such remaining outposts on the Arctic Ocean. There are five other seasoned and long serving soldiers stationed here, each with their own personal story or secret that has caused them to retreat from the real world. Their training and breaking in of the new arrival is sometimes humorous, at times harsh. Gradually, they each reveal something of themselves in their daily interactions and private moments as they continue their absurd duty in this snow covered no man's land, hundreds of miles from the nearest human settlement.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fK7uDdXttbSnYxZGw7IygibPnuZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"At the Edge of Russia","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4}
