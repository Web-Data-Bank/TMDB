The classmates become their port of safety, joy and sisterhood, all while they are going through the life changing transition into becoming adults in a country boiling with political changes. In a country with youth unemployment at 52 percent, jobs are a hot issue. The young girls at a mechanics school in Burkina Faso’s capital Ouagadougou are right in the middle of a crucial point in life when their dreams, hopes and courage are confronted with opinions, fears and society’s expectations of what a woman should be. Using interesting narrative solutions, Theresa Traore Dahlberg depicts their last school years and at the same time succeeds in showing the country’s violent past and present. This is a feature-film debut and coming-of-age film with much warmth, laughs, heartbreak and depth.","popularity":1.318,"poster_path":"/ghb0Wwi1otwb9snl5fRhvyzkQ06.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51654,"logo_path":"/qTkVCfQFiM0q9sYn9pXKOsZdH2B.png","name":"Momento Film","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BF","name":"Burkina Faso"},{"iso_3166_1":"QA","name":"Qatar"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"},{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2017-08-25","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ouaga Girls","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":6}
