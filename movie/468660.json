The residents were hurt by the criticism but lacked access to the media to respond. Supplied with equipment by Film Australia, they used this film to present a different image of themselves and their daily lives. In so doing, they answered the question of \"Whatever happened to Green Valley?\" The core of this film is the work of half a dozen residents, co-ordinated by acclaimed filmmaker Peter Weir in one of his earliest film projects. Weir also acts as the moderator at a public forum that is included in the film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wWgEzFFSsVkWnp9OW80HBAmJg0X.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1974-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Whatever Happened To Green Valley?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
