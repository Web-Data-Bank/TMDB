Love Lingers On is based on the gothic novel Wuthering Heights and Tso shepherds Emily Brontë's tale of profound passion, thwarted love and bitter vengefulness with a perfect balance of broad narrative strokes and delicate orchestration of mise-enscene. He wisely concentrates on the lead characters' simmering mental troubles, greatly enhanced by stars Cheung Ying and Mui Yee, who overcome glaring age differences with their characters to bring life to this saga of vivid emotions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mtPHyeQjfppwDnZh9SOQJbRSBy7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60408,"logo_path":null,"name":"Motion Picture \u0026 General Investment Co., Ltd.","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1957-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":119,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love Lingers On","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
