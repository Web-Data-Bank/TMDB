Since 1973, the McQuails have been helping to build the organic farming community and support the next generation of organic farmers. This is a documentary about the McQuails that explores the very real ways their farm has contributed to the long term ecological viability of agriculture in Ontario. It is a call to action for all those who believe there is a better way to take care of our planet and feed the world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/arLj8T9Jy9jfjzdYNCj9hJxIEv3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2016-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A film about how one couple built a sustainable, organic and ecologically diverse farm in a world bent on industrial agriculture and monocropping.","title":"Meeting Place Organic Film","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
