I spliced them together and put them aside. At the same time I was experimenting with sound loops, inspired by John Lilly's work with dolphin language. Briefly, he discovered that when exposed to a repeating loop in a relaxed atmosphere, a subject would begin to hear sounds or words other than those recorded. I made some loops and found that the phrase \"the struggle of the meat\" was a particularly evocative one.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Struggle of the Meat","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
