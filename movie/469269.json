Jungle Patrol follows the daily experiences of the soldiers, from their initial deployment in Port Moresby, then flying over the Owen Stanley Ranges on board the troop carrier 'Honeymoon Express', to their slog through jungle and steep terrain battling rain, mosquitoes and mud as they march from the Ramu 'Death' Valley up to rejoin their battalion at an outpost on Shaggy Ridge in the Finisterre Range.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9HQbUTu8N6YMEDMLOOvSu8mize8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115864,"logo_path":null,"name":"Commonwealth Government of Australia","origin_country":""},{"id":6309,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ministry of Information","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1944-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"This is how you go to war...\"","title":"Jungle Patrol","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
