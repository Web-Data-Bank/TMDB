The highly original film recounts Welbon’s discovery, through another language and culture, of being respected for who she is, without the constant of American racism, and how it helped her achieve self-knowledge. Linking this story with that of earlier women in Welbon’s family, the richly textured memoir blends dramatic sequences with documentary footage.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/su91qiVl2EtivbAtpzkJjGp14Ne.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Remembering Wei-Yi Fang, Remembering Myself","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
