Every performance is made up on the spot based simply on a title suggested by the audience, so be it “Mansfield Shark”, “Darcy and Hutch” or “I Know What You Did Last Season”, no two shows are the same. Performed in period costume with live cello accompaniment, Austentatious is an immersive and hilarious treat for fans of Austen and improvised comedy alike.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bmBovXSLWvUCmkOGeulO33fEDTz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33022,"logo_path":"/5d2uhejtffJP8vPgVeBH5jv0emd.png","name":"Go Faster Stripe","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An Improvised Jane Austen Novel","title":"Austentatious: Live at Leicester Square Theatre","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":2}
