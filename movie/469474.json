This is so that she can fulfill her promise to her grandmother. Nevertheless, to hold a wedding in a village is not an easy task as she would require the help from various people including neighbours, relatives, friends, and let`s not forget - a large amount of patience. The movie shows how chaotic a village wedding can be, but at the same time, it is what makes Malaysian culture unique.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/q1SYfV1WuSKY3Z25u1T9kujcDY6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":44584,"logo_path":null,"name":"Metrowealth International Group (MIG)","origin_country":"MY"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MY","name":"Malaysia"}],"release_date":"2017-07-20","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malay","iso_639_1":"ms","name":"Bahasa melayu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kerja Kahwin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
