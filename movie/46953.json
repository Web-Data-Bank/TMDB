When Martin's pal Micke suggests they get jobs together as waiters at a resort off the Swedish coast, Martin is all for it, but before long Micke finds better things to do and Martin is left on his own. The presence of pretty fellow server Jenny is a major consolation, but to his surprise, guileless Martin is soon chosen as the protégé of Gösta, the resort's short-tempered manager. Gösta clearly likes Martin and makes him his right hand man, which gives Martin a crash course in the seedy side of life when he discovers Gösta has a number of other business interests, not all of which are legal or ethical.","popularity":4.065,"poster_path":"/zx4RUtGC2OHWEphKYsx16ALJ0gs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33821,"logo_path":"/fygjYD07KphyW2zrcpFxk1J2SzE.png","name":"Film Capital Stockholm","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":10175,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fladen Film","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":2999,"logo_path":"/zGSqFee9aDgDuLD6vcs2mcJUem4.png","name":"SVT","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":327,"logo_path":"/vodjjKlAbwGeERPjrAhxZMBGPUc.png","name":"Nordisk Film Sweden","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2010-09-10","revenue":2921178,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Behind Blue Skies","video":false,"vote_average":6.511,"vote_count":44}
