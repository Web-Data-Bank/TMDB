It is here that one recalls Kogan's admiration of Lyalya's emotional documentary skills. And it is here that one recalls Kosakovsky's depiction of Lyalya as a person of extraordinarily prosperous feelings, sensitive and energetic, childish and female, shrill and quiet. The young poets are marvellously sneaky, respectfully adoring and creatively playing with - maybe even deconstructing - \"Aleksandr Sergeevich\", Mr. Pushkin, Russia's exclusive trade mark of high culture and literature.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":89931,"logo_path":"/lY9Z8cuNulmL8HQgNAYUa4Lkkrt.png","name":"Lendoc","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Your Very Personal Poetry","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
