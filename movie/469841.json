They are fearless and lethal, even going so far as to kill an undercover cop to humiliate the police. However, internal strife is brewing among the team. Three of its members plot to get rid of the leader, dissatisfied that his share of the loot seems disproportionate. The questions remain: will this faction of the gang overcome their leader, and could this gang of strong-minded thieves hold up without him?","popularity":0.901,"poster_path":"/bMSVsQnk3NzhIsdQW3FsLwcbBSl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38882,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sam Po Film Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2002-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"},{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Partners","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":2}
