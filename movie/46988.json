The small events of their lives represent universal feelings of being trapped and lost in a new world, in contrast to the successes of the dark side of democracy - drug dealing, crime and pornography. By its very nature, the film creates a picture of provincial Poland after democracy, but its charm is in the understated relationship between the two friends and the people around them and in the mosaic structure that builds up the film piece by piece.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/j1pzsrCiKFxYi6DNpEYqKFgRZhu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Torowisko","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
