Rashidiâ€™s ongoing exploration into the nature of cinema sees a group of characters adrift in space, each locked into their own sexual rituals while a cataclysm of universal proportions unfolds. Humanity has become a mysterious burlesque show for alien eyes: the gaze of the film camera. This visionary spectacle uses multiple formats and visual textures in weaving an erotic anti-narrative suspended in its own space and time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7IMCnSQ2BqslgFeUXBXKdFe3Sta.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25385,"logo_path":null,"name":"Experimental Film Society","origin_country":"IE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2016-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"TRAILERS","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
