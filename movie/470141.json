This is an unmissable opportunity to witness the superb qualities of the italian quintet in the live environment and also opens the door to the more new fans to their excellent and older repertoire.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lkLQN0acGO9r87GJKLuz80I5zdZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"DGM - Passing Stages - Live in Milan and Atlanta","video":true,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":3}
