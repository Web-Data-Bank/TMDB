The camera takes us on a hypnotic journey to the discovery of people, places, sounds, and things – a travel journal in which the eye stops to admire the everyday and the uncommon, a magnetic experiment to kidnap our gaze and rediscover the pleasure of simply seeing. The first part, East, takes us to the cities of Moscow, Tallinn, Orsk, and Novotroisk.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4xeTXU9LHPfwFTGb7slDUEyiFho.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2008-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kinogamma Part One: East","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
