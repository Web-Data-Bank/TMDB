Eugene wants to study the child’s behavior in the name of “science.” And Dylan and Connie can only laugh at his hilarious attempts at childcare. But the baby’s short history catches up to him, and the events that follow turn Eugene’s world upside-down. Eugene must decide which is more valuable—the advance of science or a life made in the image of God.","popularity":0.901,"poster_path":"/1xyoAOBxhkABkwGJ6NgVaZUTvDj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Adventures in Odyssey: Baby Daze","video":true,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
