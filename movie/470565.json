The film, an original piece written and directed by David Moore, follows a down-and-out comedian (Casper de Vries) who drifts from one small town to another. Having alienated his audience with his crude comments and dirty humours, his popularity has faded. He hits the road fighting not only for survival, but also to find the spark he once had. He has been reduced to doing shows in small towns and working for food and accommodation. As he drifts from remote location to remote location, successful comedians are being kidnapped, tortured and murdered in bizarre ways, and he seems to be riding right into the centre of this storm.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/35BPxko26UqfXdCpAYehtA1Xb1t.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":93582,"logo_path":null,"name":"Simanga Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2016-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Afrikaans","iso_639_1":"af","name":"Afrikaans"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Snaaks Genoeg","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
