All they do is sit and look at the new animal. The two dogs devise various ways to distract the people’s attention from the new animal. But when a new person called Grandpa comes to visit, FudgeFudge and Marshmallow decide that no matter how\r much they hate it, the new animal is theirs, and there is no way that Grandpa will be allowed to touch their animal.
