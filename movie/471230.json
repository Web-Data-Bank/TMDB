A collage of images and sounds playfully portraying the technical process of capturing and displaying film, Schlemowitz is perhaps sardonically directing his camera upon us, the audience. Simultaneously a portrait of precision and a celebration of the coarseness of film itself, FOR JOE evokes the rhythms and spectacle of capturing image in an earlier era of filmmaking. - Stela Jelincic","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/r9PW0Xt9vyrxn4Oc2SzasZhORWF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"For Joe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
