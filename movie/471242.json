These poet-provocateurs are the creators of the infamous \"Anti-Reading\" series, a carnival-like alternative to the traditional poetry reading. On the film's soundtrack we hear how the Anti-Readings were started, descriptions of various Anti-Reading activities including the Poetry smokable poems known as \"Poetry Cigarettes\", the memory tester called \"I Forgot,\" and the \"Diary in the Shape of a Bunny\". The film includes footage shot at Anti-Readings, with time-lapse, double exposures, distorting lenses, and frenetic non-traditional camerawork evocative of the playfully chaotic spirit of the events.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bS9XrcZ5kjNyL3Y5a8G7p4eWP6I.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Loudmouth Collective","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
