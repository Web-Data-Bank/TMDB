This modest project is the product of collaboration between professional and amateur actors of all ages and the masters. The aim was to promote the city of Seoul and the harmony of old and new. The project began as a promotional event, but its cinematic quality is equal, if not superior, to any Korean films officially invited to BIFF this year. That is by no means simply being polite. This special screening is the perfect opportunity to enjoy the unique characteristics of masters experiencing a cinema renaissance in their twilight years.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bNwHG08wvKY9frTUCLXe7T3I5M9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Journey with Korean Masters","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
