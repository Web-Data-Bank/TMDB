Living with her well-to-do parents in Tehran, Ava is a bright and focused teen whose concerns — friendships, music, social status, academic performance — resemble that of nearly any teenager. When Ava’s mistrustful and overprotective mother questions her relationship with a boy — going so far as to visit a gynecologist — Ava is overwhelmed by a newfound rage. Formerly a model student, Ava begins to rebel against the strictures imposed by her parents, her school, and the society at large.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/8zy7KAxMI3HGzRxR2yZ5Ad70AQw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"QA","name":"Qatar"},{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"},{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2017-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ava","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":7}
