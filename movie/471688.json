One was the body of Y.H. Brenner, a brilliant author, the sharp critic of his generation, a man of ambiguous sexuality and the characteristics of a raging prophet; he was well known throughout the Jewish world. An official report, written but sealed shortly after these events, was discovered only recently. It features in this film, along with animated sequences by David Polonsky (“Waltz with Bashir”), conversations with Brenner scholars, rare period stills, and selections from his works.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/HMCJU1MpBuqOJ5QrhRcsj6gKhv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Awakener: The Story of YH Brenner","video":false,"vote_average":8.2,"vote_count":2}
