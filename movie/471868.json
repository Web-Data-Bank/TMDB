Janet and Tom's parents accept each child--they recognize Janet's need for independence and support her early experiences with boys, and they respect Tom's efforts to think things through in his own way. Teachers viewing the film will note the suggestion that the school, by providing opportunities for student planning, free discussion and individual projects, can contribute to the adolescent's need for mental challenge and self-directed mental endeavor.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/HnbbfsUGjz8BbLrt2pgsNaivQO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42589,"logo_path":null,"name":"Crawley Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1955-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meeting the Needs of Adolescence","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
