Somewhere between the DJs, decks, drug busts and hilltop raves, he stumbles across a familiar face from the past, his brother Daniel. Daniel is an educated homeless heroin addict living on the streets of Dublin. The brothers havenâ€™t seen or spoken to each other in years but over a lost weekend they reconnect and reminisce over tunes, trips, their history and their city. Two brothers living on the edge but perhaps they have more in common than they think.","popularity":1.79,"poster_path":"/mIlNuvcq6lH6MgINGiBcn0dI60r.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3353,"logo_path":"/qv2v9HaStUTRjqonODM29YG0oFX.png","name":"Element Pictures","origin_country":"IE"},{"id":77789,"logo_path":null,"name":"Warrior Films","origin_country":""},{"id":13129,"logo_path":null,"name":"MDV Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2018-06-29","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dublin Oldschool","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":10}
