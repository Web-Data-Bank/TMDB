Six New Yorkers juggle love, friendship, and the keenly challenging specter of adulthood. Sam Wexler is a struggling writer who's having a particularly bad day. When a young boy gets separated from his family on the subway, Sam makes the questionable decision to bring the child back to his apartment and thus begins a rewarding, yet complicated, friendship. Sam's life revolves around his friends â€” Annie, whose self-image keeps her from commitment; Charlie and Mary Catherine, a couple whose possible move to Los Angeles tests their relationship; and Mississippi, a cabaret singer who catches Sam's eye.","popularity":7.188,"poster_path":"/qWZwKkrPNoSa7LIvUTwClmFUjBn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7372,"logo_path":"/ouJZliqslZepeihJHqBYWoBNBqR.png","name":"Paper Street Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":7373,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tom Sawyer Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":7374,"logo_path":null,"name":"Back Lot Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":19548,"logo_path":null,"name":"Haven Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-03-04","revenue":853862,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Go Get Yourself Loved","title":"Happythankyoumoreplease","video":false,"vote_average":6.521,"vote_count":239}
