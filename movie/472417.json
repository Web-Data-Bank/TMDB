Rumour has it that the entrance to the system can be accessed via shops and restaurants in La Chinesca, Mexicaliâ€™s Chinatown. In her montage Rottenberg links footage from the local Golden Dragon Restaurant with a 99 Cents Store in Calexico and an enormous plastic commodities market in Yiwu, China. The Yiwu Market plays a pivotal role in this imaginary network peopled by a group of rather strange characters. With its artificial blaze of colours it seems like a gigantic staged performance in itself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lK1usisEyK4zXge9cgTMLRk7aE1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cosmic Generator","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
