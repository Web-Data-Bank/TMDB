Portions of the video were shot in Zhuji, China, home to gargantuan pearl-making facilities, but the rest was staged and recorded in New York on a custom-designed set. As with all of Rottenbergâ€™s work, women serve as both protagonists and catalysts: the women seen here do strange things that make other strange things happen, to themselves and others, which in turn make even more strange things happen. The video as a whole is a kind of assembly line of cause and effect, reaction and response, all of which result in the production and harvesting of cultured pearls.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fzbV5BAN42Cfe5OOthunUzmlPTM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-05-09","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"NoNoseKnows","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
