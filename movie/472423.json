Moten and Tsang left each other voicemail messages every day over a two-week period, never actually making contact, but often riffing off of the otherâ€™s previous message. The recordings of these messages serve as voiceover for footage of the faces of Moten and Tsang looking directly at the camera with deadpan expressions.","popularity":0.656,"poster_path":"/odcGYNuJOkInCxIgrB2THxHQSo4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Miss Communication and Mr:Re","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
