For the first time, these four masterful musicians come together to form a jazz group most people would never expect to see happen. Taking their collaborations around the world, they toured Canada, Europe, Japan, and the United States, performing concerts and festivals to sold out audiences and rave reviews. On June 23, 1990, this extraordinary group performed two concerts at the Mellon Jazz Festival at the Philadelphia Academy of music. Both shows were filmed and have been carefully edited to create a technically flawless video of a truly \"once in a lifetime\" event. All of the songs were selected with great care, as might be expected from a band of this caliber.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jd2vQisMyhJtieg88jpE1zEVXyx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":184632,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ted Kurland Associates, Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1990-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dejohnette, Hancock, Holland and Metheny in Concert","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
