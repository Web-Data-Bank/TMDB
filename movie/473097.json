In 1991, a division was created between northern Iraq (Kurdistan) and the rest of Iraq. The UN considers Kurdistan a safe zone. As a refugee you have to come from the unsafe zone, or at least prove that you do, in order to qualify to be granted asylum. During the interview for refugee status, an official checks to see whether you really come from the unsafe zone. They ask about small details of the city you claim to come from, and compare your answers to a map to confirm that your answers correspond to it. If you cannot prove that you come from the unsafe zone, you are sent back to your country. This is a story about someone who we can call M. M tried to apply for asylum in one of the Schengen countries. He was not aware that the city he came from was in the safe zone, according to the UN. He was rejected, and was set to be deported back to his country. Then he meets J, a man from the unsafe zone.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/KPVjD66D1oc1CRIX7wgLraiyyM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"View From Above","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
