Lee is a retired coal miner and revered banjo legend, a living link to the deep past of American music. Though now well into his eighties and hampered by age, Lee continues to perform and teach his distinctive 2-finger banjo style to a new generation eager to preserve a vanishing cultural tradition. Linefork offers an immersive view of Lee and Opal's daily rituals and inherent resilience while documenting the raw yet delicate music of a singular musician, linked to the past yet immediately present.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1elC3HWamYEu4YDUSbQvCS94a4m.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Linefork","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
