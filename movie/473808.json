Keith is a Christian comedian with a style all his own. With pure energy, Keith combines side-splitting humor, slapstick, and audience participation with Scriptural truths and scientific evidence to confront youth with the harsh risks of premarital sex, and he presents the rich rewards of God’s plan: abstinence until marriage and monogamy afterwards. He helps young people know what to say and do to handle the pressures of their peers and today’s society.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3LinLJ0i1u8S3ICbMLOkXDFwjY4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Outrageous Keith Deltano Live","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
