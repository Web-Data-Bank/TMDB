Many of the familiar elements of Sternberg's work are here: speed, pulsing rhythms, explosions of colour, light and shape, images of nature and the built environment. But the conflicted situations and turmoil of earlier major films like Through and Through and Beating are gone. Instead, midst focuses dramatically on an understanding of the world through art, specifically painting, especially abstraction, here translated into filmic terms. Abstraction becomes the vehicle for taking on complexity, putting it all together in heightened moments of intense vision characteristic of ‘seeing into’ or ‘being at one’ with nature.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ArctOlb0AudJ9e7nN0DxijZxF6Z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"midst","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
