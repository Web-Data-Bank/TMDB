Men are heard in voice-over speaking a love-talk which is personal, though anonymous, or singular. Another voice-over reads parables, which present a context for the possibility of love or spirit in the world at large. The film ends optimistically: a smile slowly spreads on a man's face. Women addressing men in their own voices.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wvqBLJSBDz36tbzJ0Rx8aJip9OZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"At Present","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
