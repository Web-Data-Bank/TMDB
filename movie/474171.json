I arrived in a forgein country, and felt surprisingly familiar in the foreign. There in the streets, walking among the people, surrounded by their movements, their gestures, by the colors, the light, the beauty. Small things awakened my attention, sometimes only a short glimpse, a hand movement, the color of a sari, a temple hidden in a courtyard. It was like a long hot bath that I took there in Pune's streets - something unique and very beautiful.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/huhprrdTF0favn9pOthp7UoGTBv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"India","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
