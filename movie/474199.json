After his younger brother contributes in the accidental release of a creature which feeds off flesh, the young soldier races to rescue him and find the rest of his scattered family... plus an estranged girlfriend and her new lover. Once gathered, it's up to him to protect the survivors during the course of one grisly night. Though they manage to take shelter overnight in a local high school to buy themselves the illusion of safety, their actions inadvertently opens Michael's soul to the horrors of his own past transgressions. Fighting off his own inner demons, Michael leaves the task of finding a solution to the horrific invasion to a local science professor, and hopes his family doesn't pay the price. But he doesn't have a choice - inevitably he knows his only path is a lonely journey down that dark path everyone fears to tread.","popularity":0.688,"poster_path":"/yl2XcplVtgmW5mMIZasNmPgGe3p.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Locked Away","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
