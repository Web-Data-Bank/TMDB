They are all too busy to meet face to face. Gale plays matchmaker, by phone, to Jerry and Barbara who, in turn, hit it off beautifully – via phone and fax. Martin gets a telephone call from someone he's never met. It's Denise, with some extraordinary news. Tapping away at his computer all the while, he develops a sort of friendship with Denise – via phone. And so it goes as the friends, tap, tap, tapping away, share news, hopes, and dreams – via phone and fax. Finally Gale has an unfortunate encounter with a phone, Denise has some more news for Martin, and Frank plans a gala New Year's Eve party, but will he answer the door?","popularity":2.168,"poster_path":"/ab8iYcRfEAFwzcrkYP8tJBISX1E.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1302,"logo_path":"/zC3b70ixHh89qJIikLQPEvLqbPM.png","name":"Davis Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":38179,"logo_path":null,"name":"Skyline Entertainment Partners","origin_country":"US"},{"id":38180,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dark Matter Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-05-17","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A hilarious heart-ringing fable about life, love and hangups.","title":"Denise Calls Up","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":17}
