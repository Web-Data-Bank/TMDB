Mortars and rocket propelled grenades rained onto the city, killing indiscriminately, every day. Amongst the madness, two United Nations personnel: a British military officer and another Brit working for the UN Fire Department, decided it would be fun to persuade a global rock star, Bruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden, to come and play a gig to the population. Scream for Me Sarajevo brings that story, in all its madness, to the big screen. A story of musicians who risked their lives to play a gig to people who risked their lives to live them.","popularity":1.236,"poster_path":"/vA1ekBwl2eFmvcWyMJ7Q8s4u6gN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110021,"logo_path":null,"name":"Prime Time (BA)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BA","name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"}],"release_date":"2018-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Bosnian","iso_639_1":"bs","name":"Bosanski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Scream for Me Sarajevo","video":false,"vote_average":7.542,"vote_count":12}
