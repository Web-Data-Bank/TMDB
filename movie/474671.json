For these people the “huts” are the perfect setting in which to hide behind the memory of a social status that the crisis of recent years has undermined. A family gets into debt to go on a seaside vacation and to look well-off among the bathers, three women sunbathe in order to feel as if they are still young and to become the stars of the summer, while on the same beach a barman thinks about earning as much money as possible to get through the winter. Everyone is waiting for the night of August 15 to play a leading role in the summer Vanity Fair and to keep on pretending that the economic crisis doesn’t exist.","popularity":0.635,"poster_path":"/n0Rd98UkKAWcsBtHGLsUcTTnJTu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94662,"logo_path":null,"name":"Indyca","origin_country":""},{"id":47815,"logo_path":"/i083ezPVOG73vFgpE4KkZBuS4KH.png","name":"I Wonder Pictures","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":121324,"logo_path":null,"name":"Onirica","origin_country":""},{"id":68848,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zenit Arti audiovisive","origin_country":""},{"id":121325,"logo_path":null,"name":"Inthelfilm","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/6EFUenZrAK7IBbirooJ4ZLzJpJ5.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2018-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Happy Winter","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":7}
