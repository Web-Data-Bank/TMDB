Without the luxury of social media or even email, the women hand-wrote letters to all their past guests, inviting them to come enjoy the beautiful autumn scenery—with a clambake and some local entertainment thrown in. Director Andrea Meyerson takes viewers on a fascinating 30-year journey, through archival footage and photos, interviews with celebrities and founders, and current events and performances, offering a historical—and hysterical—look at what a handful of innovative women can accomplish.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zt61h9OZiCopDdOOTq2mrGLm6a.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Reflecting on 30 Years of Women's Week in Provincetown","title":"Clambake","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
