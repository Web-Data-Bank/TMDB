This new documentary follows Warren Hepsworth who sets out to ride a pushbike from Perth to Melbourne on a low-carb, high-fat diet. You’ll see Warren’s preparation for the ride as well as highlights and lowlights from the journey, and the diet change.  The movie attempts to debunk the notion that athletes have to carb load and that you can’t get your energy from fat. In the process we learn that much of what we’ve been told about a healthy diet is wrong.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/w0krcgKOQtHQPbsVcPJ92TB17jw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Is it possible to ride a pushbike across the Australian continent (2,100 miles / 3,400 km) without eating carbohydrates?","title":"Fat Chance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
