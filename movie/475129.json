Recorded using a full multi-camera crew and 24-track mobile studio, Goldfinger: Live at the House of Blues was directed by Joe Escalante and mixed by Goldfinger's John Feldmann to capture the band's red-hot sound with true accuracy. These two Punk veterans have teamed up to bring you a concert that is both visually and sonically stunning, while the hits keep coming. Combine this with some really sick stuff done with a twinkie and you have the crown jewel of Kung Fu's DVD series thus far. Enjoy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pmJMOyKkYvuCn4TFCieY4e5hC1C.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20101,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kung Fu Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Show Must Go Off!","title":"Goldfinger: Live at the House of Blues","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
