Photographed by Academy Award® nominee César Charlone (City of God), the film travels from war-torn Eastern Europe to the color and light of South America and is told through the voice of Willer’s father Alfred (as narrated by Tim Pigott-Smith, Quantum of Solace), who witnessed bureaucratic nightmares, transportations and suicides but survived to build a post-war life as an architect in Brazil. As the world struggles with the current refugee crisis, RED TREES is a timely look at a family besieged by war who finds peace across an ocean.","popularity":1.334,"poster_path":"/4yqjfwTmDrFrBo1VLkPgV0tmCCM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Red Trees","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":4}
