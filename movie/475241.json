Dave's stand up explores the underbelly of the American political infrastructure and shines a light on our own hypocrisy when it comes to social issues such as racism and sexism. Dave has a fresh approach to political comedy. He doesn't simply align blindly with one side of the political spectrum like many of his contemporaries but would rather call bullsh*t on both sides.","popularity":0.677,"poster_path":"/8bJvxcoHgAD0ehIdBnQ9jyRZYbG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":140076,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gas Digital","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dave Smith: Libertas","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
