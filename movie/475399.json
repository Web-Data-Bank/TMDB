He later decided to return to his small town in Uruguay to practice his profession, for which he obtained the affection and respect of the community. Vladimir Roslik was assassinated in 1984 during the dictatorship during a torture session, and it is considered the last death of the Uruguayan military dictatorship. Today, more than 36 years after his crime, it is still not known who the intellectual authors of the military operation that caused his death were. This documentary traces the life of Mary and Valery, the widow and son of Dr. Vladimir Roslik. They are currently seeking to heal a wound that is theirs, and of their community, as victims of an irrational political and ethnic persecution, under the shadow left by a law that prevented justice for the murders.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fT61rfFf5t53wKCFZ2yMNxbgCeP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34171,"logo_path":null,"name":"Raindogs Cine","origin_country":"UY"},{"id":158739,"logo_path":null,"name":"16.M Films","origin_country":""},{"id":158740,"logo_path":null,"name":"El Camino Cine","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2017-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Roslik and the Village of Suspiciously Russian-looking People","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
