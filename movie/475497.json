The documentary focuses on exploring the unknown story of Hitler's family and the dramatic fates of those related to the most hated man in history.

The film introduces Hitler's living relatives including cousins in Austria, grand-nephews in Germany and New York and his in-laws, including Eva Braun's close cousin, her two sisters and the fates of their respective families and heritage.
