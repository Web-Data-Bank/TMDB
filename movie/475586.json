Through a lens of memory and dreams, two girls explore their friendship and the joy of a juicy mandarin in the dry Australian landscape. An evocative montage, the film evokes tactile experiences and revels in the visceral. It's a musing on childhood, kinship, instincts, violence and forgiveness. The children of Mandarin Peel serve as metaphors for Australia itself, its exploration of identity, forging relationships, inventing history and future.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/31o7DhvYCSY90c207hz3JL8Zgaj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-08-09","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mandarin Peel","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
