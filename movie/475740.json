Bellowhead are the proud recipients of two silver discs and have won a total of eight BBC Radio 2 Folk Awards. The band's last studio album 'Revival' entered the UK Album Charts at no.12 and led to three BBC Radio 2 play-listed singles, as well as appearances on mainstream TV.  Early in 2015, lead singer Jon Boden decided to step down from the band and the rest of Bellowhead felt they didn't want to continue without him. \"The shows always finish on a high, and so should we.\"  DVD features the band's full concert from Leicester's De Montford Hall, 19th November 2015.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/iJYERpVzpBkGCR3fZz5A4yCAmOk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bellowhead Live: The Farewell Tour","video":true,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":2}
