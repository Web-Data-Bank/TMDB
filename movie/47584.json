Following in the path of the greatest explorers, expedition leader Jean Lemire and the crew of the Sedna IV dedicated themselves completely to measuring the threat posed by global warming in a place where Earth is particularly vulnerable. The resulting film, is a record of their incredible 430-day journey that inspires equal measures of fear and admiration. Alternating between captivating images of beauty and serenity, and spine-tingling sequences where the ship's crew finds itself on the edge of catastrophe, this is an expedition where danger and wonder are inextricably linked.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7in3deVn4F14BWLh7MtJ3MkmVQC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":806,"logo_path":"/kcNh09qqR2Pkw1JAzRW4CommrW4.png","name":"Téléfilm Canada","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":147417,"logo_path":null,"name":"Glacialis Productions","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2007-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Continent","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":4}
