Twelve years later, his victim, who miraculously survived, is terrified to learn that he's out, living in the community under supervision. He's applying for an absolute discharge, and if he succeeds, he'll no longer be required to take the anti-psychotic drugs that control his mental illness. With unprecedented access to the patient, the victim, and the mental institution, the film looks at both sides of the debate and puts a human face on the complex ethical issues raised.","popularity":1.097,"poster_path":"/gP352RVl1ypkm4dqLJso0suEdSw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"NCR: Not Criminally Responsible","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
