Some of the segments have themes such as a breezy look back at John Travolta's career that includes trailers from such films as Saturday Night Fever, Staying Alive, Grease, Perfect, and Moment by Moment. Other trailers include Mae West in Sextette, the disco camper Thank God It's Friday, Raquel Welch in Kansas City Bomber, Pier Paolo Pasolini's The Gospel According to St. Matthew and the rarely seen Chastity, the serious acting debut of Cher.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trailer Camp","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
