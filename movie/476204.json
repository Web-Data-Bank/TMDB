From the outset, the production teems with life and colour as the townspeople, market traders and servants of the rival Montagues and Capulets go about their daily business in vibrant crowd scenes. But Romeo and Juliet take centre stage for those great pas de deux: the meeting in the ballroom, the balcony scene, the morning after the wedding and the final devastating tomb scene. Although The Royal Ballet has performed Romeo and Juliet over 400 times, each performance and pairing is subtly different and Lauren Cuthbertson and Federico Bonelli are utterly captivating in the title roles.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vuOvTpUxMlFsxVjV013ym9GwEei.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20799,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Royal Ballet","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":168,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Romeo and Juliet (Royal Ballet)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
