This is due to a lack of respect, caused by loss of employment and a financial breakdown. In time, the parents are no longer able to bear their burden, which is thus increasingly weighing their children down. In Slovenia, the story from The Basics of Killing occurs on a daily basis, but it could happen anywhere.
