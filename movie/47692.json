Seventeen and pregnant, Felicia travels to England in search of her lover and is found instead by Joseph Ambrose Hilditch, a helpful catering manager whose kindness masks a serial killer. Hilditch has murdered several young women, but he has no conscious awareness of the crimes; like Felicia, he doesn't see his true self. Felicia's Journey is a story of innocence lost and regained: Felicia awakens to the world's dangers and duplicities; and Hilditch, who grew up lonely and unloved, comes to realize what was taken from him, and what he himself has taken.","popularity":4.267,"poster_path":"/itqEwiINuYvaqvFKw5YWitnqAUc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24724,"logo_path":null,"name":"Marquis Films Ltd","origin_country":""},{"id":803,"logo_path":"/jEMVaCuEjQ3lzkhakWDKNVjwd9Q.png","name":"Alliance Atlantis","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":4564,"logo_path":null,"name":"Icon Entertainment International","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1999-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"},{"english_name":"Irish","iso_639_1":"ga","name":"Gaeilge"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Felicia's Journey","video":false,"vote_average":6.376,"vote_count":89}
