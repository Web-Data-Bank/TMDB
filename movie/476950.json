Produced by and starring Ruth Roland for FBO Studios, a small operation that later became RKO Pictures, Dollar Down follows Roland as the spendthrift daughter of a manufacturing firm’s general manager (Henry Walthall), who pawns a ring purchased on credit to throw an extravagant party and sends the family’s livelihood into a tailspin. Because its last reel completely disintegrated before it could be copied, the film remains an ultra-rare curio that nonetheless captures an important chapter in Browning’s career before his successful string of films made for MGM.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4WDo0DHo8yKyF9uQMyWrAzfqWpx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1925-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dollar Down","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
