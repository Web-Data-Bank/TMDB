Malli works to help her parents collect firewood and plays with her best friend, the deaf and mute daughter of a middle class family. She longs for two things in this world: a new bright yellow dress and a magical blue bead that purportedly will restore her friend's hearing. Depicted with a surreal, occasionally nightmarish texture, the film lyrically shows both the easy friendships and bitter disappointments of childhood and the power of the imagination.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9Cxj6jC8dpFTwkxXHl1mjxQ5FZS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1999-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tamil","iso_639_1":"ta","name":"தமிழ்"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Malli","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
