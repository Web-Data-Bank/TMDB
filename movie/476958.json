In one segment a woman misreads an advertisement and arrives at a job interview dressed in a bunny suit. Another concerns a woman who hides to surprise her friends only to overhear their unkind appraisal of her hygiene. And another entitled \"Grandpa from Hell\" is a surreal yarn about a cult leader. Ranging from the humorous to the deeply bizarre, the film's static, minimalistic style makes such \"Dogme 95\" films as The Celebration (1998) look extravagant.","popularity":2.028,"poster_path":"/g8PBdpbVkF3nOeL2bbAEjljuKF9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1999-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Piece!","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":9}
