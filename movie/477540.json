They recruit workers and poach resources from a nearby construction site. As we see, it takes a village to tidy a house on short notice (or at least it should!), but there’s a limit to the capacities of even collective domestic labor. Accelerated productivity gives way to sheer physical anarchy and irreversible destruction. Dirt and debris pervade every surface—furniture and skin alike—leading to several unfortunate blackening gags.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/b4K1EobwRBRVWLEqpKVD5T66K73.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":190311,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Comica","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1911-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Hasty Renovation","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
