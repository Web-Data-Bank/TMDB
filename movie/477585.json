He wasn’t a smooth-talking, charming man. He didn’t have the striking physique of a Greek statue, or the face of a heavenly being. He was normal; but a curse brought on by his father’s infidelity granted him an ability that any man would die for. At first, Peter believes his ‘touch’ is more of a gift than a curse – until he meets the love of his life and finds the ‘blessing’ brings more chaos than he ever imagined.","popularity":0.684,"poster_path":"/U6SpFeKB3jCuIFoYkzYqoDy6fj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95331,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fritzel Media","origin_country":""},{"id":95332,"logo_path":null,"name":"Clark Family Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"It's not a gift... ...it's a curse.\"","title":"Touched","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
