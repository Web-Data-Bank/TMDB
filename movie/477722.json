I only used clips from movies I could think of or find quotes from online, so if anyone out there has any additional usages of \"gay\" and \"queer\" in old movies, let me know so I can start up a sequel. Dedicated to all in the LGBT community, as well as the fine people at Turner Classic Movies for inspiring this project.*","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lavender Lens - 100 Years of Celluloid Queers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
