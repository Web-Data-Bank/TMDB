Michael's best friend Kris (Martin Cummins) is, if anything, in even worse shape; a gifted artist, Kris' appetite for drugs has all but silenced his muse, and his girlfriend Ryan (Francoise Robertson) has little interest in helping him control his dangerous appetites. The drug-related death of a close friend and a bizarre experience with a junkie prostitute (Helen Shaver) convinces Michael that he needs to clean up once and for all, but Kris may be too far gone to save.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/k58bMCXqR58fYpc6NiJGHFWyzWb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We All Fall Down","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
