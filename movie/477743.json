The project is an evocation to the transpersonal memory, a tool to appeal to images and views that are organically overlap. The image layers fused frames together in a mesh, a porous unity, the editing of a new singular body of images. An internal pulse, a vital beat becoming image and sound.  A babbling mantra â€“the projector mechanical sound-, the movement of the cars, the atmosphere and the people create an image score.  This orphan-film, found-footage, personal register is taken out of its original context and taken into an artistic discourse so as to create a new narrative thanks to the deconstruction and the addition of images. The original footage was reinterpreted in a new visual story: an expanded cinema projection.  Trance was born as a video installation composed by three projections projected simultanously.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Al trance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
