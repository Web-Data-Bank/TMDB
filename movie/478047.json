From a desert zone irradiated to the suburbs of Algiers, they follow the course of an experimental nuclear explosion. From the trial to the accident, from the environmental impact to the \"recycling\" of the places of the past ... The starting point is historical but the story told catches up with us in the present and comes to seek us where we are - at home - for a face to face with fallout without borders.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zdmJEn6i6Tfj1VqRkNn4b0OPHdU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"At(h)ome","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
