And so it goes for Jesus, an aging immigrant cook living and working in New York. As the years have passed he now longs to return home and retire. However, he has become close friends with his co-worker and roommate, Cisco, a young, energetic Guatemalan kid ready to take on America. This inspires Jesus' lost enthusiasm and he becomes wrapped up in the prospects of opening their own restaurant together. As time passes, however, he begins to realize his mistake and must confront the commitment he made to return home. While Cisco is dependent on Jesus' partnership in the business, he is unaware of the extent of his friend's struggle. Now caught between personal success and family obligation, Jesus must choose: will he lead the life he's always imagined or return to his awaiting family?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tiempo al tiempo","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
