The artists were polarized between newcomers hungry to innovate and old timers not yet ready to relinquish control. These conditions produced a series of box-office flops and pessimistic forecasts: maybe the best days of animation were over. Maybe the public didn't care. Only a miracle or a magic spell could produce a happy ending. Waking Sleeping Beauty is no fairy tale. It's the true story of how Disney regained its magic with a staggering output of hits - \"Little Mermaid,\" \"Beauty and the Beast ,\" \"Aladdin,\" \"The Lion King,\" and more - over a 10-year period.","popularity":5.842,"poster_path":"/hywGLq5tMOuKwXfOhYUzoqNNAnU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2,"logo_path":"/wdrCwmRnLFJhEoH8GSfymY85KHT.png","name":"Walt Disney Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":16635,"logo_path":null,"name":"Red Shoes / Some Shoes","origin_country":""},{"id":90506,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stone Circle Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-09-05","revenue":80,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"From 1984 to 1994 a perfect storm of people and circumstances changed the face of animation forever.","title":"Waking Sleeping Beauty","video":false,"vote_average":7.275,"vote_count":90}
