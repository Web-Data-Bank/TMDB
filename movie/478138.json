The computer’s on the fritz and there’s not much of anything to do; there’s a lot of sitting around, eating 5-cent candies and drinking pop. Bored, Kay Jay plays with fire, aimlessly wanders through the night, encounters strangers and gets hassled by September, his aggro delinquent brother. Chained to a life of co-dependency, he passively navigates his isolated existence—but you can see the desire to escape in his eyes.","popularity":0.747,"poster_path":"/dlXUj0jDEQc6sHfKyzOtZN2NJ5H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95433,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wellington St North","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2017-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mass for Shut-Ins","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":4}
