The architect Agnese is called to the home for war veterans where her ailing father lives. The doctor at the home has left his guest, a Bosnian refugee, on night duty with her father. The commanding officer of the veterans home, a colonel, has discovered the undocumented refugee, Reuf, and has had him arrested.
