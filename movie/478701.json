It was all unbeknownst to the artist himself -- his music was even unknown to those living in his hometown in Ghana. Years of tireless searching ensued, and eventually the Los Angeles-based label owner found a lead. Ata Kak - Time Bomb follows the search that Shimkovitz undertook as well as the visit to Ghana that took place once he found him. It is a celebration of great tunes and how, when it hits the right audience at the right time, music can touch people in a way that you never imagined.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/85XeZ08gzCTbE9tHhYkunN2XS1A.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95613,"logo_path":null,"name":"Red Bull Music Academy","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ata Kak - Time Bomb","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
