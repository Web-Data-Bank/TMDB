The act of looking is implicit in my past documentary work but in this study it becomes the focus. The starting point for the film was the area that I was born and still reside in; the west end of Glasgow and its conjunction with the location where the film was first installed; a flat in Garnethill. The walk between these locations, and also central to the film is, through the St. Georgeâ€™s X area. The film deals with the relationship between sounds and images, acoustic phenomena and architectural details.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/30F2JB4xXLlxh57B4IJBQRjA52G.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"George","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
