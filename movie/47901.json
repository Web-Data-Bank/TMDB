Taking life easy and always a saucy joke on his lips, he manages to win fellow student Mary's heart, although she's already otherwise engaged. But getting a job after college turns out much harder than expected; most directors take offense at his free interpretation of his roles. Desperate, he tries in wrestling. To avoid getting beaten up he stages the fights - and incidentally invents show-wrestling.","popularity":2.204,"poster_path":"/ocrtbsRYflGwxvJAriJ5L0CLcGv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4376,"logo_path":null,"name":"First Artists","origin_country":""},{"id":41810,"logo_path":null,"name":"Balmoral Associates","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1978-02-03","revenue":16928137,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"She had to marry him.
