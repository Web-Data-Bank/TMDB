Symphonic Variations: Ashton was inspired to create a ballet on the four seasons – but as he began to choreograph he refined and purified until the ballet shook off its original meaning, emerging as an abstract celebration of movement and physicality.  Marguerite and Armand: Marguerite, a Parisian courtesan, lies on her deathbed. She recalls her tragic love affair with Armand in a series of feverish flashbacks.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iEboUuC9m9Xx2mQnhsoEDDXVpz4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20799,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Royal Ballet","origin_country":""},{"id":11514,"logo_path":"/uC4LtXWXfuDleivpGYSOsl8veXN.png","name":"Royal Opera House","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":175,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The ROH Live: The Dream / Symphonic Variations / Marguerite and Armand","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
