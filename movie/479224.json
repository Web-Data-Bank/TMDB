And we chose to shoot the prediction results when the amazing prophet Paul appeared,” said Xiao Jiang.  Xiao Jiang said they have sent invitations to the aquarium in Germany inviting Paul to attend the film premiere in China. The octopus appearing in this film is an ‘actor’ who looks similar to Paul.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5dQyxbmPRPQcmbEAuUQtl13wjFq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2010-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kill Octopus Paul","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
