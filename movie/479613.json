Though exhilarated to be free, she finds herself stranded in the freezing cold of a Pennsylvania winter, with no money and no plan. A local family, the Lapps, take her in. They know the true meaning of the season, even if they’re close to losing their dairy farm. No one in the family recognizes Adelaide except Dillon, the oldest son. He figures she’s the ticket to fast cash and plots to snap photos of Adelaide around the farm and sell them to the tabs. What he doesn’t plan, however, is their mutual attraction.","popularity":5.232,"poster_path":"/4PjXNuqhkrhcMYUJTzsPQmRnXgN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74752,"logo_path":null,"name":"Storybox Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":183837,"logo_path":null,"name":"Song For Christmas","origin_country":""},{"id":22702,"logo_path":"/l4eSl1sbXdzgBtMkxdTUIGzAJX6.png","name":"Sonar Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":63939,"logo_path":null,"name":"Howard Braunstein Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Song for Christmas","video":false,"vote_average":6.676,"vote_count":37}
