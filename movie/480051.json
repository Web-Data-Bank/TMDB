They are similar in many ways, all upper middle class professionals between 28 and 32 years of age, and very conscious of their psyche and lives. The diversity within the group however, is also remarkable. It's made up about half men and half women. The men are the most diverse, ranging from your average guy looking for love to an Afro-Brazilian womanizing rich playboy, to a conflicted homosexual, heir to a business empire. It is the friendship (Amizade) and bond between these people that the film exposes, and at the same time it explores the different personalities of this apparently homogeneous, but actually psychologically diverse group of Sao Paulo yuppies. They stick together \"'til friendship should ever separate them\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zhPxMcd7kcnuPKRB0kepoWyHYDi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"1999-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Até Que a Vida nos Separe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
