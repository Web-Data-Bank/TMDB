He instructs Noah to build an ark, in which he and his three sons, his wife and their wives take refuge. Noah is also told to take into the ark two of each of all living creatures. Noah does as he is told; The rain descends upon the earth, covering it with water, and the peoples are destroyed-- but Noah, his sons and their families are saved. \"The entire picture is a marvelous rendition of one of the most dramatic stories in all history.
