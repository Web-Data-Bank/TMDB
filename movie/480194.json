The little bears give him a bag of 'speedy-grow' in stead of weed-killer, and the weeds thrive and take over his garden. Worms are feasting on his tomato crop, and the anti-worm spray he uses engulfs him rather than the vines. Papa Bear, worn-out, in pain and bandaged, is in his easy-chair when the same commercial, that earlier had inspired him, comes on again, and the angry bear rips open the television set and throttles the announcer.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":42019,"logo_path":"/mFPTppw3q4tY9R2b7QxVv4zevLi.png","name":"Terrytoons","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1953-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Growing Pains","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
