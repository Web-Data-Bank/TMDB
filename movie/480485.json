She sews and unthreads the threads. She has the character of a hard but heartfelt generation. Ramon returns to the village after thirty years of absence. But no one recognizes him. Not even Carme. A return that, beyond the real, evokes the impossibility of returning home, no longer as a hero, but even as someone who can be recognized by his own.","popularity":0.66,"poster_path":"/5to9vCC6wOPiumafH9BWkvt6YXZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114438,"logo_path":null,"name":"Araki Films","origin_country":""},{"id":850,"logo_path":"/aF7qajGJGtMpdrtvssM9g90YanX.png","name":"Eurimages","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":114439,"logo_path":null,"name":"PolandStudio","origin_country":""},{"id":5085,"logo_path":"/mPuVc7m1Ki7OQQvAYwYfIlEI3vu.png","name":"TV3","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":35559,"logo_path":"/xLqNfq5xXETBKjq3jSSiNqqPiN7.png","name":"ICEC","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":9974,"logo_path":"/jd5x1rD18FAswqv1tRwPJCSbRGz.png","name":"ICAA","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2018-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Catalan","iso_639_1":"ca","name":"Català"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What if Penelope was not waiting Ulysses?","title":"Penélope","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
