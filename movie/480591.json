Assuming that they are now aristocratic heirs, they take a trip to visit their wealthy relations. They soon discover that Chaseville is a back-country hick town, and that their kin are dirt-poor illiterates who ambulate in bare feet. Nevertheless, Pappy (Charley Chase) could use Jimmie to defend him in a breach of promise lawsuit. Miss Lavinia Watkins sued him for not tying the knot, after pledging to marry her. The case is resolved as the courtroom becomes a dance floor, and everyone celebrates.","popularity":0.621,"poster_path":"/kIKQXJlzOjUHQjYGVzvJlxjxJKr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hal Roach Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1935-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Southern Exposure","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
