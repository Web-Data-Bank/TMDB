They came with a bouquet of promises: independence from the British empire, modernization of a country worn out by centuries of occupation, social equity and proper distribution of wealth to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor, unity of all factions, minorities and ideologies in one big modern democratic society.  Slightly over half a century later and despite the sometimes blind faith and total belief of the mass public, all promises remain unfulfilled. The screen is divided in three parts; each part shows the protagonist/ freedom fighter. The parts are social equity, liberty and unity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ah4b7uZo2CdR7gOWhEnGDKjabcO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EG","name":"Egypt"}],"release_date":"2006-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Every revolution comes with a bag of unfulfilled promises","title":"Revolution","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
