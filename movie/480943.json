I wish to avoid any \"classical\" misunderstandings of the above quote by stating clearly here that any sacrifice of love is, yes, \"filth\" or at the very least \"misdeed.\" An academic reading of Petrarch tends to bias thought that there are kinds of love which might be wrong: I do not believe this.
