The film tells the story of Omar, a construction worker from Villa Elisa, a small town in the province of Entre Ríos, Argentina, who rejects the idea that big screens may disappear. He will do anything he can to preserve that which he has held on to since he was a child, even though he has to build it with the remnants of what was.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6VqB0gnzQtPQx41ML7kObg0NnQ9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":133377,"logo_path":null,"name":"Litoral Cine","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2017-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Concrete Cinema","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
