During the height of the White Terror in the 1950s, thousands of suspected Communists and subversives were arrested; many of them simply disappeared forever. In 1993 a forgotten graveyard of 201 unclaimed victims was rediscovered at Liuzhangli on the outskirts of Taipei. Experimental filmmaker Lin Hsin-I’s Letter #69 explores the violence and injustice that still haunt Taiwan today through the letters of Shi Shui Huan, a political prisoner during the White Terror—all the way up to her last letter before being executed, a blank piece of paper.-UCLAFilm&TV","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lKvTdd74x1wvxorE9bdKMWzRrjJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2016-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Letter #69","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":1}
