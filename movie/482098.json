They are women who work, who have children, and who, at the same time, keep their independence of mind. I shot 24 portraits of 13 minutes each. I have chosen this short running time for several reasons: not becoming a bother, escape tv adds cuts, shoot the movie quickly, in one pace and without too many scratches. I am not a documentaries maker. I am more like a faces, hands and things lover. To show reality is not my goal. “Reality” is just a word, just like its twin sister “fiction”, which I practice as well, but with a different delight.\" (Alain Cavalier)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/67Az7vdytPS45pha0aCbWSvqAWp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":159,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Portraits: Deuxième Série","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
