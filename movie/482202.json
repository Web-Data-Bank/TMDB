What follows is a very confusing story in which the police, a police coroner (José Campos) and a vagrant (Fernando Sánchez Polack) who witnessed Fajardo's death embark on separate inquests on what actually happened. Meanwhile, June (María Luisa Rubio), who works as a secretary for the publishing company, is under pressure by a blackmailer (Antonio Jiménez Escribano) who has pictures of her in the sack with the deceased publisher.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vONozUncpQtXKQKUDTB8Ou5jKZl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19219,"logo_path":null,"name":"Producciones Internacionales Cinematográficas Asociadas (PICASA)","origin_country":""},{"id":93161,"logo_path":null,"name":"Castilla Films","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1969-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Murders in Chicago","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
