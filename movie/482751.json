It is a time of hatred in South Korea. LGBTQ people are the easy targets for hatred. In searching for what makes a marginalized life livable, I embark upon a journey. I encounter a double life of Lee Muk, a 70-year-old Korean “Mr. Pants” and precarious lives of a Japanese lesbian couple, Ten and Non, after 3/11. As an ever-growing number of citizens are becoming the targets of 'witch-hunting' in Korea, true faces of the haters slowly begin to unfold.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5YkeL3R21jIbbL40YLWnp0qZdJx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114202,"logo_path":null,"name":"MOVement","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2017-07-20","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Troublers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
