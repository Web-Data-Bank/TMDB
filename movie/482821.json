The band was an offspring from the separation of Sentimiento Muerto, and was formed by Carlos \"Cayayo\" Troconis (voice and guitar), Héctor Castillo (bass) and Sebastián Araujo (drums). The record is still considered by many as the most influential in the Venezuelan rock scene.  Twenty years later, Castillo and Araujo remember the stories behind the recording, as a group of the current generation of Venezuelan rockers, not only explain its influence and impact, but also play all the songs from the album, making them their own.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7iUX2mfmI8oBa3Z9G3ZWXyr8UUu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96469,"logo_path":null,"name":"academia audioplace","origin_country":""},{"id":96466,"logo_path":null,"name":"etéreo group","origin_country":""},{"id":96470,"logo_path":null,"name":"kurrent music","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VE","name":"Venezuela"}],"release_date":"2017-10-21","revenue":10000,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An historic Venezuelan rock album... 20 years later","title":"Una Fabula Muy Trillada: The Legacy Of Dermis Tatú","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
