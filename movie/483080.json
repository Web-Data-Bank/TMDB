Ruan Ji, Ji Kang, Shan Tao, Liu Ling, Ruan Yan, Xiang Xiu and Wang Rong were famous poets and artists at that time. Open and unruly, they used to gather and drink in the bamboo forest, singing songs and playing traditional Chinese musical instruments, in the hope of escaping from earthly life. They pursued individuality, freedom, and liberty. Their remarkable talent and passion made them a notable group in Chinese history. Part 2 exposes closed city life in a noisy metropolis, such as Shanghai. The 7 young people live in the city, but seem to have little connection with the city.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wRgBcIX61AfuaEekfVQiB2tXL8T.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seven Intellectuals in Bamboo Forest, Part II","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
