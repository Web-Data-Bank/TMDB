At the age of 15, Tetsunosuke approached the Shinsengumi, wanting to become one of its members. However, Tetsunosuke lacked the skill, mind, and will to emotionlessly cut down whoever threatened peace and the Shinsengumi. Even with the support of his brother Tatsunosuke and his newfound friends of the Shinsengumi, little did Tetsunosuke know the blood and pain he would have to face being part of this historical group.","popularity":2.091,"poster_path":"/qg3aU4yELluvHmvmL7V7r6HACf4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12569,"logo_path":"/pROt6mT15AC5aTadf7NRBRiTVo3.png","name":"White Fox","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":84461,"logo_path":"/c5rCgOHtg8vSfRumU84w6VZBt8U.png","name":"HALF H・P STUDIO","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":5809,"logo_path":"/aqc1Sj5nfPWb9rjf1TSayKBPlno.png","name":"Frontier Works","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":2073,"logo_path":"/6FlTZGliYTN2HaS9Qq6tCdZItWc.png","name":"KADOKAWA","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":142186,"logo_path":"/bdXTOuU7PdsDtQngyM7vb47zePs.png","name":"Hakuhodo DY Music \u0026 Pictures","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":136217,"logo_path":"/dBYuplhBgeOsGPQOI0LukWNbFWE.png","name":"Bandai Namco Arts","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":17981,"logo_path":"/8UABNMysukRi4udTHYxcNUMbPR1.png","name":"AT-X","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":87086,"logo_path":"/eAjcgCH2cxuo0oEMqRwU3g0izTv.png","name":"Sony Music Communications","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":198260,"logo_path":null,"name":"Adores","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":156696,"logo_path":null,"name":"Contents Seed","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":41861,"logo_path":"/iQ9Av0fDGKDUInp4I5czxhz5fVj.png","name":"GYAO","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2018-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Peacemaker Kurogane: Belief","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
