Barely of age, but not exactly adults, they still know nothing of love. Anatole sleeps wherever he is able while waiting for a stable job to come along, whereas Tess is about to start preparatory classes in Paris. They first meet in the surroundings of a port in decline, like a symbol of a country that is suffocating but which still has something to say. He has a tent, she has a car: together they will criss-cross the country’s roads and draw out the summer, to ensure they never forget.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":819,"logo_path":"/cEqVIluQuO1ubtID8RvOem4ZiIg.png","name":"Mars Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":34780,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chi-Fou-Mi Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2019-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Escapade","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
