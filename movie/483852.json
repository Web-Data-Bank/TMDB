He conquered the major glaciers of the Southern Alps and crossed 40km and 4000 vertical meters, from the heart of the South Island to the Pacific in just 18 hours. A route of astonishing beauty, immense freedom, breathtaking vistas and the danger of the uncontainable nature. He called this route “Symphony on Skis”.  Now, his daughters Carla, Elke and a small team of adventurers embark on the same adventure. This film is a homage to their late father who found a love and home in New Zealand's Southern Alps.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tEM29mcAxXzAV2SmfyE6xjpxfik.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96700,"logo_path":null,"name":"Atara Film GmbH","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2017-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Symphony on Skis","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
