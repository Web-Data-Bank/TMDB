The film begins by hewing closely to the actual historical details of a group that escaped from an internment camp in 1943, but slowly turns to an alternative history in which the group inspires a general Indigenous insurrection that drives out settlers from the Top End of Australia.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rmrU3K1Lbfr0g1Z47piVv8LOXV8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Night Time Go","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
