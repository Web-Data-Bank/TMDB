Written and designed by horror writer Lorelei Shannon, Phantasmagoria 2: A PUZZLE OF FLESH is a narratively unrelated follow-up to the best-selling title by graphical adventure pioneer Roberta WIlliams (King's Quest). Notorious for its \"obscene content\" that saw the game heavily censored or outright banned in several countries, Puzzle of Flesh had the player help the introverted Curtis Craig navigate a psychological breakdown while working at a predictably sinister pharmaceutical company. Dark secrets, sexual exploration and inter-dimensional twists abound!  Experience much of the game's craziest moments and outrageous gore condensed into a coherent*, freaky and funny narrative.  *Well, as coherent as the actual plot of the game.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fgR1mNgjUwRZRgBF1We7IgwNzhg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96802,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sierra Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Entwine yourself in darkest desire...","title":"Phantasmagoria: A Puzzle of Flesh","video":false,"vote_average":1.5,"vote_count":2}
