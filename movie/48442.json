Perversion for Profit illustrates its claims with still images taken from various softcore pornography magazines of the period-- though, 'sensitive' parts of the human anatomy have been obscured by colored bars. The film is in the public domain, and has become a popular download from the Prelinger Archives.","popularity":1.306,"poster_path":"/e0sVFjSGzT4Cf0WnslrcP2rdzqq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":130074,"logo_path":null,"name":"Citizens for Decent Literature Inc.
