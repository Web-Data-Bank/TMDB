There is no dialogue or narration in this \"fake\" documentary, which has the look of a real documentary, but actually uses actors to portray awakening residents of Taipei as they go about their morning routines. With the camera as our guide we see lively early morning markets, residents going to church, students practicing singing, people exercising, and others heading off to work. The feel is of realistically captured scenes of spirited local street life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kSlR5bLiXJcIGNiHIu96UdEN0K2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"1964-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Morning in Taipei","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
