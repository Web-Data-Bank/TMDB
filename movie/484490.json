His wife certainly had a hand in it. A few years back she disappeared from his life without trace, without explanation. Shortly before he was admitted to hospital she reappeared at his medical practice, accompanied by a child he wished was his own.  In his waking dreams, realities and memories of his hopes and dreams blend with dreams of realities without hopes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wNUYB3tQqKZUnCB0iJApMO4QaoD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2017-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elysium Hernalsiense","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
