The film focuses on Gina, a young mother, whose efforts to be a loving mother and wife are undermined by her declining mental health. Things deteriorate when she develops an obsession with the local weatherman, which leads to an admission to the nearby psychiatric hospital. Over the years, as she grows up, her daughter Alice struggles to relate to her heavily medicated mum, and causes chaos when she comes up with a plan to reconnect with her, which divides the family forever and leads to a moving climax. Set to the songs of The Smiths, The More You Ignore Me provides a sometimes stark, yet comical insight into life within this quirky household, whilst addressing mental health issues and their impact on the family.","popularity":3.369,"poster_path":"/u8X6wiZpYO6tcecjqSZ53M7RyQG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":54431,"logo_path":"/v4CjB3zI2xRw1UDSYjwKA8K71gT.png","name":"Genesius Pictures","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"You definitely can't choose your family!","title":"The More You Ignore Me","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":24}
