The Marriage charts the emotional predicament of the man who has strong feelings for two persons. There is great pressure to marry and only mild support for LGBTQ rights in Kosovan society, so Zeqiri’s film, which unashamedly puts same-sex and heterosexual passion on the same plane, is a forceful step in the right direction, as well as a dynamic portrait of romance and deception in the shadow of war.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/xItvQ4i3ddBeSGuBlyghUiLcdhv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98523,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bunker Film Production","origin_country":"AL"},{"id":110887,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bézé Film","origin_country":"XK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AL","name":"Albania"},{"iso_3166_1":"XK","name":"Kosovo"}],"release_date":"2017-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Albanian","iso_639_1":"sq","name":"shqip"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Marriage","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":7}
