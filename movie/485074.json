And this is the story of a young boy who grew up in that country, and how he ended up challenging -- and sometimes even convincing -- the greatest powers in the world to follow Costa Rica's example. \"Oscar Arias: Without a Shot Fired\" is a Don Quixote-like saga with great historical touchstones -- Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev, Cold War politics and Communism, Central American War and Peace. It follows a slight, academic, and most unlikely hero over the course of more than fifty years, as he travels the world in a quest to stop the spread of the weapons of war. In the end, it is a story about the triumph of reason, of the sparrow triumphing over the eagle, and how the impossible dream can sometimes come true.","popularity":1.521,"poster_path":"/lMPVX1e4aqiHWam5wn4WAZWqsQ3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96915,"logo_path":null,"name":"PeaceJam Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The story of former president of Costa Rica and 1987 Nobel Peace Prize Winner Oscar Sanchez Arias.","title":"Oscar Arias: Without a Shot Fired","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
