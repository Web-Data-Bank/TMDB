Then, oddly, people behave as if the picture is amazingly important. Later, it seems that this childish scrawl is somehow a map of the mythical city of El Dorado and people are willing to kill to get it. Eventually, a group of colonists use it to dig and dig for this treasure--only to end up blowing themselves up. Then, the natives all celebrate and live happily ever after.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Chain","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":8}
