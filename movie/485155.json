Children and grandchildren from this extensive family have come to the party from all over England. At the party the family members talk about hope and dreams for their children. The past and present lives of various relatives are compared with each other, while fragments from radio-programmes from the fourties and the fifties draw an emotional and historical line. Set against this archive material are fierce images of modern day family life in urban England in the year 1993. This makes the film a collage of dreams, memories and images of present-day life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qm8GCurum1tPlrLA8RCOHJZ3oUq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8598,"logo_path":null,"name":"COI","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":73742,"logo_path":null,"name":"Middlemarch Films","origin_country":""},{"id":7281,"logo_path":"/lkqIuaKTm2sg3umwTBScmqyzLX5.png","name":"BFI","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":16366,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Sept Cin√©ma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1994-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Time of Our Lives","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
