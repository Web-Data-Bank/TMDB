How his success brought access to \"A-list\" celebrities and the places they congregate, including the Playboy Mansion. That his young wife gave an interview to Ebony Magazine revealing that the relationship wasn't all it should be and that Cosby was \"temperamental.\" Without saying more, this documentary is well worth watching, coming on at a time when the jury for his criminal trial in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania is deadlocked.","popularity":0.653,"poster_path":"/tdsNVg51vkosu6wPCOCcKTAvdQJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bill Cosby: An American Scandal","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
