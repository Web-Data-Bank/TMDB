A band plays, the kids get drunk, the boys and girls tepidly flirt, and groups deploy into cars for the purpose of destroying mailboxes, tee-peeing houses, breaking lawn ornaments, and sparring with the police. The film is composed entirely of footage Trecartin took during his senior year of high school in exurban Ohio; as such, it baits the viewer with genealogical significance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9hBqU8lEDOnwuz9hoMlzLOMYVvI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Junior War","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
