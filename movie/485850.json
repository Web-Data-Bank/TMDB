This documentary wants to recount the life of the trees and their deep relationship with people that every day work hard to give to the wood a second life. What happens in this second life of the wood, when it becomes boats for sailing and musical instruments for playing... The trees is the opposite of movement: it dies where it's born. But there exists a second life that starts as soon as its saps stop flowing inside its vessels: forests became fleets that explored the world's geography while writing the Romance of the Earth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/igFKnarcea67sFFZmiuLoNDB5J4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trees that walk","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
