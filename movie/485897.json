In this animated short where the real story plays out in what’s not said, French cartoonist Aude Picault (Moi je) delivers a delightful ode to the sometimes-complex amorous relationships of modern times. She also takes an affectionate but penetrating look at friendship between women—and the jealousy, envy or judgment that can lurk behind the prettiest speeches.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kzP2b5nPywJhuBUQ7Ki0BvnQFyR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Free Love","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
