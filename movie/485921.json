The glassy facades of this city’s skyscrapers reflecting the passing by people of its diverse districts, shown in the reflection of distorted mirrors, symbolically depict the Spirit of a metropolis, as if it lives in its own shadows and reflections.  This distorted reflection of Tehran comes together with modern verses of a poet who was known as the Poet of Tehran after publishing his illustrious cycle of poems about Tehran in the 60s. As a flâneur, the poet himself saunters around this city -through his voice/poem/memory- reflecting upon the reflections of old/modern monuments, sculptures, statues etc. of this giant metropolis.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iDVa5A8juow0lC5vhROeXcdF6P5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97091,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cultrual \u0026 Art Organization of Tehran","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2012-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"a documentary about a city","title":"Tehran, A Conceptual Art","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
