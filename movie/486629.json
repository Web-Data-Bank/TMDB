The former is lazy, gambling, and bad-tempered, while Carlos inherited the virtues of his father. Don Armando is not satisfied with his children. Mercedes, his favorite daughter, likes life in the big city, she is flirtatious and superficial even when she is in the ranch; she has an attitude of contempt towards Carlos, even after his life is saved, but that attitude hides a nascent feeling of love. His brother, also named Carlos, is what could be described as a bad person. With these characters various dramatic episodes unfold.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/b8SWjc2DS9Vh0pL3pfFMDSv1d7M.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":162161,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tylca Film","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"1924-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Criollo viejo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
