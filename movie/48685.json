While hundreds of thousands had already left, 25,000 people remained to see this incredible performance. Hendrix, along with drummer Mitch Mitchell and bassist Billy Cox, offered masterly renditions of the songs of the recently disbanded Experience (\"Hey Joe,\" \"Foxey Lady\"), and gave a preview of the blues-based Band of Gypsys (\"Izabella,\" \"Hear My Train A Comin'\"), as well as Jimi's era-defining rendition of \"The Star Spangled Banner.\" Though the weekend had witnessed some landmark performances by other great artists, this performance from Hendrix is regarded by many as the defining moment in a festival ripe with defining moments.","popularity":3.046,"poster_path":"/tWgNxwEbmrCtDfXmF8NkZm9f5zk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33,"logo_path":"/8lvHyhjr8oUKOOy2dKXoALWKdp0.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-07-06","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jimi Hendrix: Live at Woodstock","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":14}
