Featuring sprightly music by folk singer Pete Seeger and narration by theatre actress Frances Hyland, the film is shot through the seasons on a large Canadian cattle ranch near Kamloops, British Columbia. With hundreds of cows and calves on the ranch, there’s no shortage of work to be done: soil cultivation and crop maintenance are taken care of by seasonal ranch hands while the resident cowboys—“anxious guardians”—brand and breed their bovine charges.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zHUVIIRPQCfmlcGMBMS2YO4X10O.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1961-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cattle Ranch","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
