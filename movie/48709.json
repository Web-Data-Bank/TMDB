One night, a homeless man sleeps in the foyer of her apartment house; she gives him a hot meal, then a place on the floor to sleep by her radiator, then she offers herself. She falls in love, giving him new life, clothes, a place to live. When he grouses that he must bar hop while she uses the flat for her work, she finds them a larger flat. He grows restless, seducing a manicurist and pressing her to prostitution. He's arrested for procuring, so Marie must decide what to do; he, too, must face the consequences of his choices.","popularity":5.89,"poster_path":"/A2vNKPMD1JnsgOV0Adimhd9vIPA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":635,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Alain Sarde","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":1852,"logo_path":null,"name":"Plateau A","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":104,"logo_path":"/9aotxauvc9685tq9pTcRJszuT06.png","name":"Canal+","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1996-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Man","video":false,"vote_average":5.833,"vote_count":27}
