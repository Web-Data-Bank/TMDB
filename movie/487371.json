Eva Braun was the longtime romantic companion to Adolf Hitler, as well as a photographer and amateur filmmaker. Her 8mm Agfacolor-stock home movies, recorded at her leisure, were seized by the US Army in 1945. They were subsequently assembled into 8 reels, from 28 reels of original camera negatives. The US National Archives received this 8-reel film in 1947, and in 2012 began the digital restoration process.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iRtvQzRHiS3A9Xq5UqQCWxsQxhA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Home Movies of Eva Braun","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
