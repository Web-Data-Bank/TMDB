Jaeger Lieutenant Nyborg, an admirer of Parikka, suspects a definite miscarriage of justice. He wants to save the actors. The forthcoming visit of the German General von der Goltz to the prison island provides him with a suitable opportunity. Nyborg suggests that the actors prepare a comical performance for the visitor and not be shot. Instead, they will be given a new trial. Preparing a comedy in the horrible circumstances, in the midst of hunger and death, seems quite an overwhelming task. Only a handful of real actors are still alive, the rest of the troupe consists of stagehands. Parikka has to use all his inventive skills to be able to produce something funny.","popularity":1.581,"poster_path":"/7L0QhTjs5dmOxbPUt5GCsrn0OF1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73146,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ljudbang","origin_country":""},{"id":33389,"logo_path":"/u3M4P96gbfON4lKiJVruOnhreFh.png","name":"Inland Film Company","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2018-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Humor is a matter of death","title":"Laugh or Die","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":18}
