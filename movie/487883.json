Within a few weeks of meeting, Lori learned that Alana suffers from Lupus and has been waiting on the kidney transplant list for years. The state of New York, where Alana lives, has the lowest number of organ donors in the country, and because of her complex medical background, her chances of finding a donor match were incredibly slim. Against all odds, Lori found that she was a candidate for donation and decided to give Alana the ultimate gift. If the transplant is a success, Alana will triple her life expectancy and be freed from nightly dialysis. But if it fails, Lori will go through risky surgery and lose a healthy organ in vain. BEAN is an emotional medical journey for two families that tests the true limits of love and sacrifice.","popularity":1.02,"poster_path":"/aVQcg7ZnfI91YKQsBopikvjZz4Q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97523,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gigantic!
