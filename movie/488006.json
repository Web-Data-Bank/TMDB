A white South African middle-class mother and daughter are brought together by the mother's illness. That closeness is more than metaphorical: the daughter must get into the bath to wash her weakened mother. Perhaps prompted by that, the two begin to exhume personal memory - discovering how they recall the past differently and how these nuances of shared experiences shape their perceptions of the present. This contested past is evoked by archival Super-8 footage that is as absorbing as the spinal narrative.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Remember Differently","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
