When a stranger approaches him outside the gym with the offer of a specially produced steroid, Stanley is drawn into the ever more violent operations of a powerful organisation, unwittingly entering into a series of tests designed to prove his mettle. This is a film about power, determination and being your own worst enemy. It celebrates the archetypes of classic Film Noir, and the dark, conspiratorial storytelling technique of Franz Kafka, but with a contemporary minimalist aesthetic.","popularity":1.0,"poster_path":"/m8V5lwi9l7fFlDtPPwfUDK9SYks.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kaufman's Game","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
