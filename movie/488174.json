Together with filmmaker and adventurer Hans Schomburgk he filmed in Togo in 1914 the first live-action film in Africa, which possibly inspired James Rice Burroughs for his novel on Tarzan. In the company of three Codelli’s descendants and actor Primož Bezjak, we traced the fate of Codelli’s film, brought the remains from Togo and Berlin to Ljubljana and used the Green Screen technology to bring to life 15 live-action scenes based on 600 Codelli’s museum photographs.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iHBAwIjwTyCSVOE2IG3QrSo0Pd2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":93432,"logo_path":null,"name":"Produkcijska skupina Mangart","origin_country":"SI"},{"id":97795,"logo_path":null,"name":"Astral d.o.o.","origin_country":"SI"},{"id":93431,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Kerozin","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"2017-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Codelli","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
