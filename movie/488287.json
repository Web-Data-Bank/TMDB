A sport that is increasingly popular in the United States, the tour provides these students and the Kiwi teams they battle a rare opportunity to dig beneath the surface of things. On the field, troubled histories melt away, and we see boys rise as men; girls lead as women stronger for facing up to a challenge. 'Red, White, Black and Blue' provides a sensitive take on a rough game: it blends on-field triumph with off-field tragedy. If the spirit of these teens is any indication, the Olympic Rugby Gold Medal - currently held by the United States since it was last an Olympic sport in 1924 - may just be defensible after all.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8iMivQU9Cg63hGGqwuC9WP2G0zo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Red White Black & Blue Odyssey","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3}
