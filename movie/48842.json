A reporter encourages the angry ranchers - led by the Mountie's mother-in-law - to stage a sit-in at the research center. When an eccentric old rancher dies after being exposed to a deadly strain of anthrax, the protesters are quarantined. No one notices that the reporter has disappeared - along with several vials of the deadly bacteria. The RCMP officer begins his own investigation, gleaning information from a U.S. government agent. He finds himself racing against time to recover the stolen anthrax.","popularity":1.058,"poster_path":"/lNXa5MNjkHGIKFTzhNWdV87bXmI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":62889,"logo_path":null,"name":"Illusions Entertainment Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"How do we protect ourselves","title":"Anthrax","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
