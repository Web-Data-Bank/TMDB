A young couple driving in an open car take the viewer through more than twenty intriguing sequences that stimulate the visual sensibility as the film explores the relationship between intellectual and sensual knowledge. It also comments on some conventions of narrative and documentary and has some fun with film theory. “Undivided Attention” works on various levels, the most accessible being entertainment value and on a more astute level, the cinematic exploration of denotation/connotation in an oblique narrative. It is a rich and challenging film that is also a pleasure to watch. - 42nd Edinburgh International Film Festival","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5L5hsr6JlSknBGdq8mTH3GuLlqC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Undivided Attention","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
