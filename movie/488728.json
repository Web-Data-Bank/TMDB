Cookies and cocoa. And a favorite uncle, played by Kirk Cameron (Growing Pains), to read the Christmas Story. It's tree trimming night for the Barnes family -- and a young guest who thinks the Bible is \"just another story.\" Then, as the timeless words of Luke and Matthew unfold the events of the first Christmas, something wonderful happens. The Bible comes vividly to life! Your children are there. At the manger. Hearing the angels. Experiencing the wonder and joy of the birth of Jesus -- as it really happened! Discovering -- with skeptical young Sam -- the truth of God's love, and the reality of Jesus in their lives!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/21eq4nhm7iA19B0B1JUjAbryzYs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Visual Bible For Kids - The Birth of Jesus","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
