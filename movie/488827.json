It is the fifth time in three years, and all of its victims have been the elderly. The \"answer\" to the problem is to put up yet another traffic light that will en-snarl traffic. While everyone agrees the \"old folks\" should have a safe access over a busy thoroughfare, a group of young people have had enough. They believe the answer to really protecting these seniors is to change their lifestyles and habits instead. Their appearance at the neighborhood board meeting will transform the usual rubber stamp agenda into a manic evening of misstatements and misinterpretation. A sidesplitting comedy of humans being human, \"Juniper Lane\" takes a funny, fresh new look at the generation gap.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3XA8OQYKQysJcrILQCyli41uWlp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Juniper Lane","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
