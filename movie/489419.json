George Dupont, a young farmer, is living with his parents on the farm, while his sweetheart, Sadie Allen, resides on an adjoining farm. George finds rural life irksome and is satisfied that he has talent as an artist. He enters a school of art. Unfortunately, a year passes and his money is exhausted, so the instructor tells him he has no talent, and dismissed him from the school. George tries to write home of his failure, but his nerve fails him. Meanwhile those at home have been waiting in vain for a letter, so Sadie resolves to go to the city and look him up.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":32639,"logo_path":null,"name":"Independent Moving Pictures Co. of America (IMP)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1911-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Back to the Soil","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
