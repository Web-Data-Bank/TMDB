Its way of fighting involved kidnappings and assassinations of government officials as well as representatives of foreign firms. The crusade of the military junta against its terrorist practices later became a pretext for state terror against civilians who had nothing to do with ERP. Gleyzer's so-called \"secret film\" records the kidnapping of a manager of the meat processing factory and cooling plant Swift. The partisans request an improvement in the working conditions in the factory in exchange for his release.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1zGTIIdRRWqC323Ov0tTnSm1E2E.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25966,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cine de la Base","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Swift, 1971","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
