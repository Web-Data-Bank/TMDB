Numerous 16mm films were sent to Sears, but only one film was preserved; however, as it was not complete, it could not be used. In 2003, the Munich cinémathèque museum restored the film, which  narrates a Ring Lardner short story. The missing parts were filled in from a radio play recorded in 1946.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9sGbFZdoT0eC2s1Bf7daevRRUO4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1970-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Evening with Orson Welles: The Golden Honeymoon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
