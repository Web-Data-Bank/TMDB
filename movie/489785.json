Tae-soo, whose philosophy of life is to live so roughly that even his son's name is Gun-sung, is far from the traditional image of a responsible and sacrificial father. Meanwhile, son Gun-sung is a man of good living who prepares music and study step by step as planned so as not to be like his father, and I don't like Tae-soo, a father from one to ten. The relationship between the two, which is a mixture of affection and affection that has been building up for 15 years in a quarrel, is hardly narrowed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/akIldSyagZ3TON0B1NV6uRRl4U9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7036,"logo_path":"/javbyY0ZCvlFJtly3tpZqf2NwLX.png","name":"CJ Entertainment","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2008-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Like Father, Like Son","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
