The first of its tales aptly deals with contemporary civil unrest with foci on the interrelationships between law enforcement in communities it serves, and corruption within the justice system as a whole. It unfolds from the perspective of an African-American male who feels circumstantially slighted by society, and because of that, takes the law into his own hands and goes on a rampage which erupts into a war in the process.","popularity":0.601,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":97928,"logo_path":null,"name":"Link Egglepple Starbureiy","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":200,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Easter","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
