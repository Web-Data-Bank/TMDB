Through interviews with \"science moms\" who are on the front lines of this struggle, we’ll dissect the bogus claims of these celebrities one by one and explain in simple language what the science really shows about GMOs, vaccines, homeopathy, and any of these topics that are often in the headlines, yet even more often are misunderstood.  We can’t change everyone’s minds, but we can make our voices heard. One mom at a time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qq07HBMCgGM7VRKV0oXKFhtoPPh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Science Moms","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
