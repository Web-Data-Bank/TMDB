It’s a story. The story stretches back to the ancient mountains of China, to the deep Canadian bush — from a parking lot big-air jump in Michigan to Norway’s Arctic Circle. It’s shouted from the top of Colorado’s Rockies and around the rocky rim of Lake Tahoe. This is a story that’s rewritten each winter, and one we’ll never tire of telling. How else would our love of snow get passed down from generation to generation?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aerq150mbGx5nU6Rlip3mDc89LC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17183,"logo_path":null,"name":"Warren Miller Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dynasty","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2}
