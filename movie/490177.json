The film follows his rise from a talented outsider to the celebrated Yugoslav director of the acclaimed war film, 'An Occupation in 26 Pictures'. His life story is an unconventional depiction of a rise and fall that reveals compromises made in order to survive artistically during communism, as well as the missed opportunities and miscalculations that led to his inability to adapt in later years. Is the charismatic Zafranovic a national traitor or a victim of historical circumstances in which the only thing he wanted to do, in his own words, was to be himself and make films?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u8Wj6T80qDE9ngld7u21wEYWfzj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84487,"logo_path":null,"name":"8Heads Productions","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"}],"release_date":"2013-06-29","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"},{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Occupation, the 27th Picture","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
