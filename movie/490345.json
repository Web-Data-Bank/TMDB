It turns out that this necklace contains the bloodthirsty spirit of Ellen Morgan (Gitty Srinita). The first time she tries wearing the necklace, Katri has an accident and is admitted to the hospital. There, one of the nurses, who tries on the necklace, dies immediately. The necklaceâ€™s hold on Katri then continues once she has healed; Katri becomes a slave to the spirit of Ellen Morgan. Andika (Johan Saimima) and Sion (Emri Margono), the doctors who are treating and monitoring the condition of Katri begin to suspect that the necklace has some kind of power over Katri, and they try to help her. Andika succeeds and survives the effort, but Sion falls victim to the necklace and its spirit.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2PPaLjgNZYTfhM9JIlVjsol6CqU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16514,"logo_path":null,"name":"Soraya Intercine Films","origin_country":"ID"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Demonic Scandal","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
