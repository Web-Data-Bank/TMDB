Photographed on Super 8mm and using hand-processed film techniques to create an unworldly zone between sleep and wakefulness, it looks at three characters and the film’s material that connects them.  It is a film that invites the viewer to sleep with the film’s protagonists, to drift across into the dream world of the film’s material and lose touch with their current surroundings.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/doihoVkLM6QSFuoCThvNgU445L5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98058,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fivesixteen Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2012-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Some Must Watch, While Some Sleep","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
