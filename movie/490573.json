Eight people will reveal the magic,cruel, sensuel, powerful relationship they have with their own bodies.The adventure of the film is multiple: the objective is to give voice and images to women whose body or sexuality is seen as non-standard, unseen or without speaking. The film will highlight possible resistance through an intimate portrait gallery, collective experimentations, tantra, exchange of fluids and knowledge, rituals… A strong political and feminist manifest about body politics, female sexuality and its representation, as well as about diversity and various forms of sexual desire.","popularity":0.882,"poster_path":"/pNNh4NtZwrfB9mqfAhPnshtxuMe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1373,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jürgen Brüning Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":98075,"logo_path":null,"name":"Womart Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Body, My Rules","video":false,"vote_average":0.5,"vote_count":1}
