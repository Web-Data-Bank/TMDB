This film exposes Dr. Sturdy Colls’s investigations as a massive fraud.  For instance, her research actually included digging near clearly marked Christian graves; she also falsely assigned homicidal intent to a normal life-saving bath and disinfection complex.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xMc4XkmM7UcJ3Qtvd42jXYmKThO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Treblinka Archaeology Hoax","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
