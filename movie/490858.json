As if invisible, the camera crosses over the wall several times, fusing the experiences into something that didn’t exist in the mid-eighties—outside of the cinema. 25 years after the Berlin Wall was built, perhaps the most horrifying aspect was that the Berliners took it for granted and had learned to ignore it. The wall was mirrored in everyone’s head. This film questions that ingrown attitude.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-05-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Drehort Berlin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
