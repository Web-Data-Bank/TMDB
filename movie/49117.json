Episode one is about Madeline, a lonely woman obsessed by religion and cleanliness. Her solitary existence leads her to place an advertisement for a man willing to share his life with a 'single, working 35-year-old.' She is a woman of our times who is caught between the paradoxes of modern life and individual needs for communication. The world offers her opportunities to satisfy material needs but, unfortunately, this is to the detriment of her spiritual needs.","popularity":0.655,"poster_path":"/tX0ro1WBa20PwoBxoW6re4izpVO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":104,"logo_path":"/9aotxauvc9685tq9pTcRJszuT06.png","name":"Canal+","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":108769,"logo_path":"/riBQBny2Z3la03Wy8I27Ahn2spC.png","name":"Playtime","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":19580,"logo_path":null,"name":"Climax Production","origin_country":""},{"id":33279,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ad Vitam Production","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"1999 Madeleine","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
