To his surprise and horror, he is arrested upon landing and accused of being a traitor in connection with the cargo he has been carrying - which, unknown to him, contained plutonium. Although he pleads innocent, Nick is not believed and is sentenced to a long term in prison. While in prison, he is subjected to special experimentation at a mysterious laboratory - with one unnerving, and unexpected, side-effect of the experiments being intermittent invisibility.  â€”David McAnally","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/jzhBX06HlgdJOjjzcFIPxqeoNSg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":132,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Vanishing Man","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
