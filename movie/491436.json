It’s a fast life in the fast city of Dar es Salaam. There’s no time to stop and Mashoto likes it this way. There’s no time to think about the people he left behind in the village.  Until silence cuts through the city racket with three words: mother has died. With those words Mashoto’s life changes forever. He returns home, to the place he abandoned, to bury his only ally.  Yet his mother has left behind a gift. Her voice, her unseen presence, a gentle whisper urging him to open his eyes and strain his ears- to learn the lessons of nature, of the earth and the roots that draw their nourishment from it.  Cast out by his father after losing the little money his mother had left, Mashoto must learn to survive from the land. He must learn to face old enemies and forge new alliances, to fight and to love. Most of all, Mashoto must discover what it is he is fighting for.","popularity":1.089,"poster_path":"/eGPhnQye8iwfFcpCtwwDKB1t2pS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71554,"logo_path":null,"name":"Media for Development International","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TZ","name":"Tanzania"}],"release_date":"2017-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swahili","iso_639_1":"sw","name":"Kiswahili"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Who are you without a home?","title":"The Gift","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
