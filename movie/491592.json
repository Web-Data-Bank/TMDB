We go inside the peloton, we’re pushed up impossible climbs and forced down rapid descents, we lie alongside him in his hotel room in post-race agony. We ride in the support car, the source of comfort, supplies and fleeting relief from the cold. And we know that every mile traveled is a mile closer to the end.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/osITztQ0YR1ItZ6vzt4WNF4UKZ8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Race To The End","title":"Time Trial","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":6}
