Psychiatrists are notoriously private; cautious about revealing personal information, and noticeably absent in the media.  What has been the consequence of this? If you don’t tell your story, someone else will tell it for you. Mental illness is the number one cause of disability worldwide, however many patients still fear coming to see a psychiatrist – that they will be overmedicated, not listened to, not understood, not cared for, or worse - maybe the psychiatrist will see how “crazy” they are and lock them up. The stereotype of being “crazy” is equated with being dangerous, weird, scary, and ostracized - and in some ways - so is being a psychiatrist.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dQ97d7CkCcCxzNxSGLLPTgeeROS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98368,"logo_path":null,"name":"Art of Psychiatric Medicine Comittee","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Art of Storytelling: The Human Experience of Being a Psychiatrist","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
