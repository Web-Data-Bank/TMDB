Sijara Eubanks was expected to face Nicco Monta√±o in the finals of the season to determine the inaugural UFC Women's Flyweight Champion. However on the day of weigh ins, Eubanks was ruled medically ineligible for the card after a visit to the hospital overnight for allegedly miscalculating her weight cut, which led promotion officials to replace her with Roxanne Modafferi.  A women's flyweight bout between promotional newcomer Priscila Cachoeira and former Invicta FC Bantamweight Champion Lauren Murphy was expected to take place at the event. However, the pairing never materialized due to alleged visa issues for Cachoeira.","popularity":2.642,"poster_path":"/2FIWvEItiimN1yFxf7cC0E3Msp0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":197,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Ultimate Fighter: A New World Champion","title":"The Ultimate Fighter 26 Finale","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
