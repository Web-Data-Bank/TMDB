As they mature, Shmuel becomes more orthodox and religious while Jacob is exposed to Christianity and ends up becoming a leader of Messianic Judaism, spreading the word of Jesus.

The conflict between the two brothers escalates to real violence when an attempt is made to kill Jacob, causing the dissolution of the entire family.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sT1ALpkWSYJ52v6tcMw5C8fecGP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2017-12-28","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A New Spirit","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
