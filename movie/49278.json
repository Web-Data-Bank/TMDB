At a medieval school, an old astronomer begins to teach a class of young men, all armed with telescopes, about the art of scrutinising an imminent eclipse. When a mechanical clock strikes twelve, all the young men rush to the windows and fix their telescopes on the heavens.","popularity":1.675,"poster_path":"/5iOi4ZGBYzfVfkwIEdHHC2eQK8z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Star-Film","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1907-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Eclipse: Courtship of the Sun and Moon","video":false,"vote_average":5.986,"vote_count":38}
