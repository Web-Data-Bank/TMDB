In this animated film with live actors the protagonist is a girl, who is brought up by her grandfather. He lives in a strictly regulated world where animate as well as inanimate creatures have fixed places, which are marked by chalk on the living-room floor. Anything surpassing those borders is mercilessly scarped out of the film strip. The young girl, in whom the primal forces of nature are awakening, learns from her grandfatherâ€™s fading sexuality. She starts to scrape the filmstrip as well, to change the world according to her own will. What will she draw instead of her past childhood?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zqvc3AFLnXGIdiEMNuoEnx6nQGI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"1993-07-26","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Living-Room","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
