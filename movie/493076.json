Everything and anything that hasn't been nailed to the spot winds up in her possession - whether it's a wallet belonging to a passer-by or a Jeep. But the police are on to her and the streets of Riga are becoming just a little too dangerous for Margita these days (played by rising Latvian star Rezija Kalniņa). She decides to break camp and hitchhike her way up north coming to rest at a little place called Vineeri in Estonia, where she soon finds herself looking after an entire household, including three men and a small boy.","popularity":0.727,"poster_path":"/cXLGBKAsxgHjBhNngpIFPUYKNvL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6154,"logo_path":"/5YKiuLl1qnTI3ZX5yxF8ZdtQ4GH.png","name":"Allfilm","origin_country":"EE"},{"id":112128,"logo_path":null,"name":"F.O.R.M.A","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"},{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2001-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"},{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Tragi-comedy about a girl thief, who cons her way to almost becoming a housewife in order to avoid apprehension.","title":"Good Hands","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
