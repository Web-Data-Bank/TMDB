Though officially Afro-American, he is neither continually conscious of his racial identity, nor -- it seems -- all that affected by it. Meanwhile, his Caucasian buddy Josh (Jeremy Bobb) appears to be grappling with his own racial identity by suppressing his \"whiteness\" and both acting and thinking black -- dating African-American women, aggressively and vociferously touting The Autobiography of Malcolm X, etc. Initially, though A.J. insists that his African-American heritage is neither here nor there for him, he begins to observe the myriad ways in which it impacts his social relationships.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zyDS6FOerXEjQEtswMhTuHWAkxi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"White Lies, Black Sheep","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
