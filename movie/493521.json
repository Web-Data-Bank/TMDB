This poetic documentary introduces us to her creations - houses built from clay, bamboo, slate and river stone, constructed in tribute to their natural surroundings. At the age of 86, Didi Contractor pursues her vision working day and night - dreaming her designs then designing her dreams. She sketches roughly, then proportions with pinpoint accuracy, the blueprints for economically and ecologically sustainability.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9Xf105qOmmPNrynBtzYu37CG1Pg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98662,"logo_path":null,"name":"Individuofilm","origin_country":""},{"id":98663,"logo_path":null,"name":"Xaras media GbR","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2017-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Didi Contractor: Marrying the Earth to the Building","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
