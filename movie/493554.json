I drive a taxi. Every day is meaningless to me and my few other hobbies are flying kites and squeezing my brain for words to write a novel with.  I've been having bloody nightmares for some time and one time I picked up a strange woman. She says she's a half-witted revolutionist but won't say who she really is. I give her a name: Hye-mi, and start my relationship with her in the ruptured life of mine.  I find a new meaning to life and I try to enjoy her stories, love and pain she carries. For her.  However, she disappears on me without a linger and a year after that, I get a postcard from Hye-mi without a return address. I had forgotten about her, but I began pulling out memories of her once again.  Was there an Eden for these two people who didn't know they were related? Where was their Eden?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ofGa4sF6Rcab21NT2fuuamaODn4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2013-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eden","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
