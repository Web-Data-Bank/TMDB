Getting ready to take a break from reality for a while, Officer Bob Butterfield agrees to one last job, a few hundred miles away, at an abandon amusement park on a private island. With two x Marines joining on the journey as Community Service Officers, no better way to keep the ten Community Service Workers in line, right? The owner of the amusement park, a cracked out clown, and his pal, \"a little person\", are always on premise and loves to put on a good show for the very few who find this island. The question is, will they be the ones putting on the show.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/krWdDsXLGMvdnHUDX4uqKk2WErM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98770,"logo_path":null,"name":"A Shadow in the Dark Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bloody Island","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
