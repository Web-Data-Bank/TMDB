Yvonne has lived her life on the ice: traveling internationally as a famous performer in the Ice-Capades and then coaching for nearly fifty years in her hometown of Denver.  In the her 80's, she experienced severe physical obstacles and used both muscle memory and her passion for skating to rehabilitate.
