However, when the film’s leading lady is found murdered in her dressing room, Aurora enlists her Real Murders Club members to help gather clues. At the same time, she experiences mounting concern that Aida is becoming attracted to the film’s director who, like everyone else working on the set that day, is considered a suspect. And this time around Martin is especially worried about Aurora’s safety after learning that the film’s screenwriter, who has a romantic history with her, emerges as the prime suspect.","popularity":4.728,"poster_path":"/tgvdZ03jrMIMPx1gtSCfUxlzlGR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6438,"logo_path":"/hQVRii7CRnfG0rowSEc6ibt2Pke.png","name":"Muse Entertainment","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":184816,"logo_path":"/a0Dcjk6gPSzlcC2A2K8ynJwpSVl.png","name":"iCandy Production","origin_country":"US"},{"id":48782,"logo_path":null,"name":"Head First Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-01-07","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last Scene Alive: An Aurora Teagarden Mystery","video":false,"vote_average":7.359,"vote_count":64}
