In New York, people are indifferent to derelicts sleeping on sidewalks, to a woman's assault in front of an apartment building, and to a couple injured in a car crash. A man, stripped of his identity, dies in bed with actors expressing his agony. A cheerful, innocent young man walking a city street in a time of war pays a price for this innocence. A couple talks about cinema while it watches another couple talk of love and truth on the eve of one character's return to Cuba. Striking students take over a university classroom; an argument follows about revolution or incremental change.","popularity":2.15,"poster_path":"/5Zjd6dwTpmIyg0rLZ3zCBzbpYpr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4990,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ital-Noleggio Cinematografico","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":10451,"logo_path":null,"name":"Castoro Film","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":14679,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anouchka Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1969-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love and Anger","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":21}
