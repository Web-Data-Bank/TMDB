By stripping their music back to the barest framework then rebuilding it with acoustic based sounds and delicate orchestration, creating a sonic concept that showcased the complexity and depth in their music. It was with this sound that they took on the road enthralling audiences in sold out venues across the nation. Working closely with renowned producer, composer and long-time collaborator, Anthony Cormican, who had previously written and arranged strings on the band's Day One and gold-selling Universes. Wanting the experience to be more daring and involved than merely picking up acoustic guitars and brushes instead of running with amplifiers and drum sticks; the band performed with a host of instruments - from ukuleles to 12-string guitars specifically incorporating them into an ensemble of string quartet and grand pianist.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ifVeEfTZD4YaQM84zx0dQdMNNyt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/5Va1Ie5c4sjfEYqixQ3L8qg7fKu.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2010-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Birds of Tokyo - Broken Strings Tour","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
