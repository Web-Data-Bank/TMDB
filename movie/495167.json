The 9/11 event was so beyond my comprehension – you can understand and react to a death of one, or two persons‚ but I could not react to the death of 2500 people – it was an abstraction, a fairy tale – that’s why I framed my 9/11 film (shot from my roof) with the fairytale, with the image watching this story, the story of 9/11. Like any other fairy tale coming from the past – by this girl this child dreaming, listening, and dreaming about the tales coming from the past.  ―Jonas Mekas","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2001-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ein Märchen aus alten Zeiten","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
