Equally influenced by psychedelia and analog synthesized feedback, these videos undulate, shimmer, and pulse with an electric current surging from a hyper-conductive wire plugged into a supernatural outlet. At times the content of these videos appear as analytical devices for complex, cerebral data sets. In other moments, these videos become cascading diagrams of serene and blissful states of otherworldliness. Playfully gliding back and forth between different outputs and inputs, this group of videos shows a willingness amongst the collaborators to bring together the all-too-often divide between these unique technological spaces. In doing so, this collection provides entry into a new world where the digital and the analog coalesce and fuse, creating a newborn child of saturated splendor.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5d2px1z4dRIPLS25adQqETCqPqk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spectral Net","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
