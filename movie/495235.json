It is a place that seems to have no purpose and which leads to nowhere. A presence is felt, but never seen. The house itself is alive; the walls are vibrating, the windows reflect abstract landscapes, the textures are constantly shifting. Created by mixing video synthesizers and 3D animation, this piece is a collage of different rooms slowly scrolling from right to left. The seamless juxtaposition of these interiors generates the illusion of a cohesive space while creating impossible perspectives.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/apBKuHhZfLeF1liFVSiADeU5xst.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aires","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
