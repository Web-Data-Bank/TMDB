Loosely acting as a prequel to the LA-based All Ears documentary, The Unseen provides rare insights into a scene that has remained distant from the public eye, while giving birth to some of the culture's richest and most influential sounds. The film [provides a] glimpse [into] the hidden and elusive characteristics inherent in a city often depicted in a one-dimensional light.\" - Gus Sutherland","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qcFpF5RxzrlmdZd9YprDEeWfeyj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Unseen: Detroit Beat Tape","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
