A certain refinement is the framing of the whole story with a puppet show that moves into the played scenes. The film carries out a folk tale of a stupid castle lord who lives in a ruined castle, a fraudulent painter and a lazy shepherd.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":12508,"logo_path":null,"name":"Štúdio hraných filmov Bratislava","origin_country":"XC"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","name":"Czechoslovakia"}],"release_date":"1960-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pán a hvezdár","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
