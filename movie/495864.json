A big feat in Armin van Buuren's impressive career. What made this extra special, was the amount of views the track received on YouTube. With more than 33 million views, 'In & Out Of Love' is the most viewed video all time on the Dutch YouTube, in all categories.  But the rest of this number one DJ's catalogue of music videos is at least as impressive as this mega-hit. With almost 15 years of music involvement and an ever-growing passion for music that's been there from childhood, Armin van Buuren built himself a solid discography. 'Blue Fear', 'Shivers', 'Yet Another Day', 'Serenity', 'Sail' and 'Never Say Never', to name a few.","popularity":2.667,"poster_path":"/6w1SBms56X0M3aH1n1j8rChMxer.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":67042,"logo_path":null,"name":"Armada Music","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Armin van Buuren: The music videos 1997 - 2009","video":true,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
