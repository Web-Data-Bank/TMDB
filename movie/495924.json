In this investigation, scientists embark in search of the micro-plastics. Small, mostly invisible, toxic, they are home to the new ecosystem:  the plastisphere. But where are they?

And what is the impact of them entering the food chain?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rqCOf4YDqXQQeFMvpFy1pi2juHj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80404,"logo_path":null,"name":"Via DÃ©couvertes","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"99% of the plastic that should be floating in the oceans is missing.
