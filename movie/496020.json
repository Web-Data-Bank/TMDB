Fabio and Alain are teenagers with widely differing backgrounds and philosophies. Fabio is a rebellious Stalin quoting, left-winger from a lower middle-class family. He dreams of being a rock star even though he can't play a note. Alain, a soft-spoken boy from a middle-class family prefers to quote Plato. Alain is attracted to Fabio's enthusiastic talk on political activism. When the local press accuses them of terrorism after they toss a rock through a window they are initially delighted. Their delight is short-lived when they realize that may be blamed for some of the real terrorism the town has been experiencing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/r1WkbyC0OVlKmaoaRLkdMXMC6Uz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11332,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Sept-Arte","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":4790,"logo_path":null,"name":"IMA Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1994-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paix et amour","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
