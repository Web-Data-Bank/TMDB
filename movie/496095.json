Wallenberg had saved tens of thousands of Jews from the Holocaust in his role as Sweden’s special envoy in Budapest. Tireless filmmaker Rodnyanskiy searched across the globe for traces of Wallenberg, from Moscow and St. Petersburg, to the Russian interior, to Hungary, Israel, and Sweden. Featuring interviews from subjects as far-ranging as Ronald Reagan, Simon Wiesenthal, and Yelena Bonner, the film passionately confronts the shadowy circumstances of Wallenberg’s fate.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mission of Raoul Wallenberg","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
