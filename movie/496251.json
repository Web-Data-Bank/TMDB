On the streets of our own neighborhoods, an immigrant is lured into a fake job that turns out to be a trap; a child is sold by her relative to sexual predators during weekend visits; and a teenager is forced by her boyfriend to turn tricks in motel rooms. After conquering their tragic past, Maria, Miriam, and Michele offer voices of hope for those still in captivity today, and a call to action for us all to create awareness and eradicate modern-day slavery.","popularity":0.805,"poster_path":"/3dvA8OShoDpd2b9mXIrzez6rJhE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":99011,"logo_path":null,"name":"innerlens Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":199474,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cari Lutz Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-01-16","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Modern-Day Tale of Sex-Slavery","title":"Sold in America","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
