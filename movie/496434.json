With the help of a washed-up psychologist (Ray Medved), he reluctantly unearths a number of odd habits which can only be described as unnatural and bizarre. Meanwhile, a strange woman, Maggie (Kat Reichmuth), awakens in Golden Gate Park with no recollections of how she arrived. Enlisting the aid of a friendly social worker (William McMichael) and local gypsy (Selenia Mason), she slowly begins to recall her true identity. With an increasing and unexpected desire consuming her, it becomes clear that Griffith and Maggie's new obsessions may be more than just memory loss as they become a dangerous and deadly threat to the city and each other.","popularity":0.665,"poster_path":"/eT7KhzqCrIWSANZfmsJ17u6SD9C.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Apocrypha","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
