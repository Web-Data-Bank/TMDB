Whilst seeking the truth to their present and past behaviour but driven by self-obsession and malevolent denial, far from leading to salvation, the road they actually travel leads them to a place from which they may never return. A place where the truth is more horrific than the lies they tell themselves. One person from a past that connects them both holds the key to their new place of captivity and that person is in no hurry to leave.","popularity":0.827,"poster_path":"/2tZfUD0pwpYU3US8fRyxCCTcail.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":104121,"logo_path":null,"name":"AMP Media","origin_country":""},{"id":104122,"logo_path":null,"name":"Thin Place Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":127,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Thin Place","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
