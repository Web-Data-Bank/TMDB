As the film unfurls, it reveals an astonishing and colorful truth: a number of the women subsequently formed a singing ensemble during their golden years, and decided to tour Italy in that outfit, regularly performing the folks songs of their youth that majestically re-evoke that time. As the women congregate and talk on-camera, revealing their colorful, magnetic personalities, they tell detailed and evocative tales of the past and of the emotions they initially experienced.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/f4mIodyUVeClcs5tDlAeIeJAflM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From Mother to Daughter","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
