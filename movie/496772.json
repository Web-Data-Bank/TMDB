Carlos Martins gives in his presentation on relics, in addition to other content.  This is the same teaching he has given all over the world.  Among the special features that are included:  1) A complete biography on St. Maria Goretti that Fr. Carlos recorded within the kitchen of her family home (i.e., the place where she was attacked) and within the hospital room where she died (the place where she forgave her attacker).  2) A virtual exposition in which over 160 relics are individually zeroed in on the screen.  This offers an opportunity for individuals to venerate the saints right from their own home.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/q6fcUDuifLMyymr3T9jwGTFyxHB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sacred Relics of the Saints Treasures of the Church: Saint Maria Goretti","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
