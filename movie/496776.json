South African naturalist Mike Rutzen is crazy about great white sharks. He never saw Jaws, so he doesn't share the terror that makes these sharks the world's most feared predator.  For ten years, Mike has swum with great whites without the protection of a cage. He has spent so much time in their company that he has learnt to read their body language and to think like a shark. It is this knowledge that keeps him safe.  Mike's quest to understand them better now takes him into the heart of a seal ambush site, where he hopes to witness their hunting behaviour underwater.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/s9StNNYxp173DCbBQjhU9WkhBox.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8090,"logo_path":"/ktzmUmVCQPjQGblWfDPBLKsIWKA.png","name":"BBC Earth","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2009-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Great White Shark: A Living Legend","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
