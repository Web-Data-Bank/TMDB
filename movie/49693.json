This is what she does for «La Lectrice», a novel which tells the adventures of Marie, a young lady who likes reading so much that she decides to make a profession of it. Selected texts, Provence in wintertime, different neighbourhoods. Deviations from fiction, secret itinaries. An imaginary space penetrates the space of the town, whose streets Marie stries along, while Constance devours novel. The unknown lies behind each word.","popularity":2.202,"poster_path":"/oElAqwPGT0FQVoZ6UZyoyL5BYcW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14498,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ciné 5","origin_country":""},{"id":6998,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eléfilm","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":468,"logo_path":"/42mtaDQPu1OTmfrvmwq6OsnHLPG.png","name":"AAA Production","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":69639,"logo_path":null,"name":"TSF Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1988-08-17","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Lectrice","video":false,"vote_average":5.846,"vote_count":26}
