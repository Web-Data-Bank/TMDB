The young man ostensibly wanders into a time-warp in which aspects from his childhood and adulthood mix together. In this never-never land he comes across a beautiful woman/witch who is lost inside the labyrinth of her mansion, just as the young man is lost in the labyrinth of time — and on some levels, perhaps the labyrinth of his subconscious.","popularity":1.343,"poster_path":"/xZoSucIT1j9YwS51eZGrIh7ePam.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12797,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jinriki Hikoki Sha","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grass Labyrinth","video":false,"vote_average":7.333,"vote_count":27}
