Anxiety, paranoia, violence, and murder follows.  Sex, conspiracy and violence explode in GLASS, the second instalment of Vince D'Amato's neo-giallo series. Tirra Dent plays Zarana, a woman consumed by paranoia and rabid nightmares after she finds herself relentlessly stalked by the enigmatic killer. Set in the \"glass jungle\" of Vancouver's gentrified neighbourhoods, Glass is a scathing critique of social media and the society of middle and lower classes.","popularity":0.869,"poster_path":"/cdS6cAFnnG3c4kSm0kbt3UIxdwE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2015-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Who's Watching Who","title":"Glass","video":false,"vote_average":1.3,"vote_count":3}
