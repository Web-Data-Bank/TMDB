The director’s decision to leave the family’s faith results in an ultimatum from her mother, a devout Jehovah’s Witness: either return to Jehovah or never see her again. As the choices are revealed, the film discovers what has been lost and questions why subsequent generations often repeat the past.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nqeiXr5mLtyr0WGmCeLZEbvsX9Z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last of the Last Days","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
