She is constantly frustrated by what she sees as institutional bias against women in soccer. One day while watching her beloved Palmeiras, she is struck by a handsome man, Romeu, that she sees rooting for the Palmeiras' chief rivals, the Corinthians. After meeting the same man again in the middle of eye exam, Julieta and Romeu quickly become a couple. However, in order to avoid incurring the wrath of her parents, Romeu is forced to pretend to be an adoring Palmeiras fan, an increasingly difficult task for the die-hard Corinthiano.","popularity":2.508,"poster_path":"/rZeUkq6ztgrtIOQqAawMDYiydcV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8508,"logo_path":null,"name":"Labo Cine do Brasil","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":93230,"logo_path":null,"name":"BMG Models","origin_country":""},{"id":13931,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmes do Equador","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":93182,"logo_path":null,"name":"Geração Conteúdo","origin_country":""},{"id":13969,"logo_path":"/bEpiJ2zXGIH70JT16asjWNFtOEv.png","name":"Globo Filmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2005-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Romeo and Juliet Get Married","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":60}
