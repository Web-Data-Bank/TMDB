They each draw on their own style and own language to prolong the life of a nameless hero. The aromas of cultures, the taste of words and the perfume of travelling carry us from one storyteller to the next. Like an epic story, this film oscillates between imagination and reality, the inner world and the outside world, documentary and fiction.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wgwkZwqdOsFbiLRGPq8HEuzDn9D.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Surya","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
