The Larry Sanders Show was ahead of its time, becoming an immediate critical and audience hit for its satirical, tongue-in-cheek look at Hollywood. The series that combined documentary-like camerawork with a clever blend of fact and fiction set the standard of quality for HBO and influenced the development of shows like Sex and the City, Six Feet Under, The Sopranos, Curb Your Enthusiasm, and The Office.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Not Just the Best of the Larry Sanders Show","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
