Jaroslav Kvapil’s libretto inspired Dvorak to compose a masterpiece, a compelling opera full of poignant lyricism and dramatic twists. Ádám Fisher and Stefan Herheim masterfully presented this ‘lyrical fairytale’ at La Monnaie in 2008. In this widely acclaimed interpretation, the fairytale elements sometimes assume frighteningly realistic dimensions so that one might see this enchanting production as a psychoanalytical study of male fantasies and female archetypes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/VtP26bthUPEVs85YPAexo7Loje.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":99460,"logo_path":null,"name":"Oper Graz","origin_country":""},{"id":82718,"logo_path":null,"name":"De Munt / La Monnaie","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":152,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rusalka","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
