With a sleazy manager taking advantage of his workforce, and friends and colleagues ready to get what they want from him, Lucas still holds out hope for something more serious than just sex. Could a hot new stop on his paper route risk distracting Lucas from what he really wants and might just happen to be in front of him the whole time, or does he need to make the mistakes in life in order to see what’s really been there the whole time.","popularity":0.952,"poster_path":"/zuoBbJBXqNJlVqAF4k73Tc0VHZg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32455,"logo_path":null,"name":"DreamBoy","origin_country":""},{"id":19755,"logo_path":"/73BIyXqVgJsDWtgTCqeKsf1afVy.png","name":"Eurocreme","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2016-08-23","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"PaperBoy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
