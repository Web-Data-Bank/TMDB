One is a bride to be, hoping her ex-addict brother can stay sober long enough to walk her down the aisle. The sibling is a sexually obsessed dope fiend, desperate for any kind of psychosexual release - and lots of wacky white powder. Locked up in a hotel room, freebasing his sordid memories and many erotic needs, he slowly comes unglued. Soon, we are witnessing rampant mood swings, murderous hallucinations, and the world's most misguided nuptials, complete with dancing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lzi8ur1QJpFgW24VJ22dyzkXwec.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Golden Embers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
