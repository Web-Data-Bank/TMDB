I first met Mark at SUNY Binghamton in the fall of 1973, when I took my film production class. Over the years we became friends and colleagues, film/video makers and teachers. In the aftermath of his death, I decided to record unedited monologues by people who knew him from Mass Art--recounting their dreams or apparitions of Mark. I used an old black and white Panasonic studio camera similar to one he had been playing around with; I wanted a different quality to the image from HD and the Panasonic ghosted the image. I had thought it would be a web based work and nonlinear, but Erica Beckman's section, which we edited according to her instruction, changed my plan--it was a definite ending and a surprise to me. I found the piece worked as a projected linear experience. I urge you to watch it once that way.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/meSJrxnexHjAM1joEGUHReUWER.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dreams and Apparitions of Mark LePore","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
