But the mainstream medical community says Morgellons is not a disease at all, but a delusion propagated and reinforced by social media. “It’s all in your head,” they say. The Pain of Others is a found footage documentary about Morgellons, a mysterious illness whose sufferers say they have parasites under the skin, long colored fibers emerging from lesions, and a host of other bizarre symptoms which could be borrowed from a horror film.","popularity":0.999,"poster_path":"/tnJJKOJnpRvdcCrxrQ4JC5CZm97.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":99769,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wishful Thinking","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When suffering has no explanation, what fills the void?","title":"The Pain of Others","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":4}
