Human hands must individually open the flower, pick the petal, place it under the lens, press the shutter, and upload the image to the cloud. Then again, and again, and again. Computers document the signals generated by humans. When computers were human, they were often women.  In August, 10,000 roses were placed in the atrium of Bell Works. The work of photographing the individual petals and turning them into a dataset was performed by sixteen men. The photographs, a sequence of petals, reenact the rose. Beauty compels the act of replication.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1i4qFMrklDjXKQ5xVjpuTc1l8HF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cloud of Petals","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
