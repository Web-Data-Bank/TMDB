One band reigned supreme and toured far and wide across the eastern earth, but never even left Russia - until now. They only have once chance, to not only rule Russia -but to become the best band in the West. The strategy is simple - get on the boat, create an album - and make new friends. All with hopes of finally becoming a household name in the United States. But sometimes fame is harder than just toppling a government.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pytduz3R1erUGTsW6LdCt78iLeM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vladivostok Vacation","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
