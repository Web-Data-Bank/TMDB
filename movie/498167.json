After all, the sun had shone on the previous Sunday, Mr. Mon visited him on Monday, and on Tuesday he was on duty as usual. That would be so far admittedly still nothing special, just as little the middle of the week on Wednesday. On Thursday, however, there is thunder. And when Mr. Taschenbier then also has Friday off, he goes into town on Saturday, curious about what might await him. In fact, he encounters a creature that none of the other passers-by can make sense of. Only he logically suspects that it must be a \"Sams\".","popularity":1.192,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":4488,"logo_path":null,"name":"Augsburger Puppenkiste","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1977-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Augsburger Puppenkiste - Eine Woche voller Samstage","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":3}
