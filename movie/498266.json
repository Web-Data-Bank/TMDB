A shoe shiner Ayoub, a bourgeois couple, Jad and Ines in a loveless marriage, a wealthy but ailing art collector, and a young medical student Aida moonlighting as an escort, each interaction forever changing them and setting them on an irreversible trajectory towards catharsis or total collapse.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/inROkqQ4q2oMet9eR8Ol0xbVe6H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102480,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nelfilms","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MA","name":"Morocco"}],"release_date":"2017-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Burnout","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
