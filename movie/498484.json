With a script inspired from the life of the Romanian community in Cyprus, the film tells a painful, personal story in a world in which we use only numbers to talk about emigration, prostitution and suffering, as an unfortunate statistic.  Abused by her step father, then driven away from home, Eva, a Romanian teenager, becomes a victim of human trafficking. She ends up prostituting herself in Cyprus. Years later, the young woman creates her own web of relations and becomes a full-fledged \"courtesan\" for influential men: politicians, diplomats, business people. Her life takes a dramatic turn when she is diagnosed with AIDS.","popularity":0.952,"poster_path":"/yViEnddpbcFsBL7CKPNXcp27JT8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CY","name":"Cyprus"},{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2016-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Very Last Morning","video":false,"vote_average":9.333,"vote_count":3}
