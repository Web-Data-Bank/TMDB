The girl in his reverie is stunningly beautiful, a blithe spirit who taunts him with her smile, her shapely figure, her sensual persona - all that a man would want as a companion for life. The real world, however, offers him someone entirely different. Anna is sweet, attentive, down to earth - all that a man could wish for in a normal marriage. The right decision, it appears, is made. And then it happens: Yannis's dream comes true - on his wedding day.","popularity":0.665,"poster_path":"/u8Ih9ptnOLXdAVlkybR9246JgYR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12994,"logo_path":null,"name":"Regina Ziegler Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"1999-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dream a Little Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
