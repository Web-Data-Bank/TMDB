It has also been used in Utopia, Malani's first multiple-screen installation, wherein this film is projected adjacent to the film Utopia, shot after the artist moved to a basic apartment building in a suburb of Bombay. This format allowed her to juxtapose the idealism of the sixties with the later dystopia of urbanism in the seventies.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hraZfWIAQlx9owJsMWfYFa0EGl7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dream Houses","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
