On the fluid border between reality and fiction, Touch Me Not follows the emotional journeys of Laura, TÃ³mas and Christian, offering a deeply empathic insight into their lives. Craving for intimacy yet also deeply afraid of it, they work to overcome old patterns, defense mechanisms and taboos, to cut the cord and finally be free.  Touch Me Not looks at how we can find intimacy in the most unexpected ways, at how to love another without losing ourselves.","popularity":5.023,"poster_path":"/tcz5rD4ChAqNiYDwmoa8yVyRsOY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109365,"logo_path":null,"name":"Manekino Film","origin_country":"RO"},{"id":18485,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rohfilm","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":15608,"logo_path":null,"name":"Agitprop","origin_country":"BG"},{"id":88412,"logo_path":"/zXlsf6gUwDdZnYMHlbGeJnMaSkp.png","name":"Les Films de L'Etranger","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":24701,"logo_path":"/jA4X5Pggj8L4FijoqzXmFOFA4gs.png","name":"Pink Productions","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","name":"Bulgaria"},{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2018-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Touch Me Not","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":44}
