He faces the eternal challenge of all actors - how can you bring joy to other people when you yourself have none? Played by Toby Jones, one of Britainâ€™s best character actors (he played and voiced Dobby in Harry Potter films, starred in Captain America: The First Avenger and Captain America: The Winter Soldier, as wells as on television drama Sherlock), this sad character becomes a hero of a story that resembles an ancient tragedy about being not needed at the feast of life of other people.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/1IKlpfdF1Vl9OCX7TE4Oerk8odh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Entertainer","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
