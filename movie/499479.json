Since 2002 the international community has injected more than a trillion dollars into Afghanistan. What went wrong? This film examines the counter insurgency/ culture campaign that the US government [and others] waged. Told through the eyes of Afghan youth, who start the country's first ever heavy metal band and an adventurous Australian, who created a Western style music scene in the capital - Kabul. Will head banging, disenchanted Afghans win the hearts and minds of their peers or will the Taliban come back from the grave?","popularity":0.706,"poster_path":"/an2uGY3A7sgb5fOVnTs7fPIQM4q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116916,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rockabul","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":116917,"logo_path":"/zRsEcawanLB5GWMfRs2IZFnRRNr.png","name":"No Thing Productions","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":116918,"logo_path":"/2y61ovYR4mybNQKSHVhF03pDyLj.png","name":"Argus Productions","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":89231,"logo_path":"/m1ZkgePPUfLOoaaEsAeCyG9tWAf.png","name":"Tiger Nest Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2017-07-20","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"RocKabul","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
