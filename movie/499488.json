Meanwhile, some workers in the anthill plan a strike so they can have their old ministerial positions back. Faniquita still does not work and does not think about charges. She just wants to go out and play. Already Talento lives another dilemma: he feels he can be faster in his activities and thinks that Tolero, always stuck in him, is the great culprit because he is so slow. Smilingüido is more agile, but distracted with some friends involved in various situations and ends up forgetting Forfo, who is in trouble.","popularity":1.154,"poster_path":"/9YCBpbPbKrWJFmCTPnjbWWrT2mq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":99815,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sonopress-Rimo da Amazônia","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2008-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Smilinguido em Histórias de Formiga 2","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
