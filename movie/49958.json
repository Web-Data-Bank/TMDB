Their excitement vanishes when Mel becomes delirious after skinny-dipping in the waterhole. Feverish, bleeding, confused, she physically and mentally regresses to a vicious predatory state. Mel has gone primal. Melâ€™s lover and friends realise they are the prey as she savagely hunts them down. Before they can escape another one of them starts to regress, posing a hideous choice; kill their friends or be killed by them. Their only hope of survival is through a cave, where Anja learns too late the meaning of the ancient rock art they came to study.","popularity":4.857,"poster_path":"/mXq7G9GcemHVDpxDmwWDoVULdnQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":197440,"logo_path":null,"name":"Primal Films","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2010-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Evil Lies Within","title":"Primal","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":90}
