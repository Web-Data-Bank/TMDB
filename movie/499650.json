But at some point, the 19-year-old has had enough of this gang of boys, who are too busy getting high and drunk to do anything with themselves. Survival must be secured. The next time money for food runs out, Maki crosses paths with the much younger Acha. This newcomer is a fresh arrival in Kinshasa, and doesn’t yet know the rules. Spurred on by Acha’s beginner’s luck as a thief, the pair set off on an adventure together, which soon arouses Mbingazor’s jealousy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/r6c0EllN6A9ZFTveWVXoPOrgVaK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15433,"logo_path":"/9nnaDAbuHwbikxAV1t1BC2Z60GC.png","name":"Orange Studio","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":182773,"logo_path":"/r2RsiJ0PaIwPM2H07kLcdfinTdV.png","name":"Cl1 D'oeil Studio","origin_country":"CD"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"CD","name":"Congo"}],"release_date":"2018-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Lingala","iso_639_1":"ln","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maki'la","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
