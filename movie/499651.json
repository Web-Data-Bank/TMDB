At the age of 86, he still fishes alone on a small boat to make a living, dreaming about his retirement. Kumi-san is an 84 year old villager who wanders around the shore everyday. She believes a social welfare facility “stole” her disabled son to receive subsidy from the government. A “late - stage elderly” Koso-san runs a small seafood store left by her deceased husband. She sells fish to local villagers and provides leftovers to stray cats. Foresaken by the modernization of post-war Japan, the town Ushimado's rich, ancient culture and tight-knit community are on on the verge of disappearing.","popularity":0.963,"poster_path":"/9sAiOVqyWaYwBC3hctOhqkeihq0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12457,"logo_path":null,"name":"Laboratory X","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2018-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":122,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inland Sea","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":9}
