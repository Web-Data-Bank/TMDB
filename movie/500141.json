Ready to embrace his traveling experience, he misses his train and finds himself in a small village region. Viewed by the villagers as 'an eccentric in a white Stetson', he finds himself settling into an unfamiliar world of very strange people. Here the people really do drown newly-born puppies, eat the fish they catch in the river and even smack their children. But it only takes a few days before Joe begins to understand the villagers and, after accepting them into his heart, he falls in love with Liza, a beautiful local girl.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1y517IK2ddGRPxpnNBe1hXm7V0H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":104250,"logo_path":"/6BF18oLINXIs1FZCZBAV1JOJx5h.png","name":"Star Media","origin_country":"UA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2013-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Poor Liz","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
