But only they always cursed because their things somehow disappeared. The kitten lost milk from the bowl, the puppy lost his bone, the kid lost a carrot, and the chicken, almost had hardly been eaten. But one day the friends accidentally found a rat-thief, who they then all together amicably caught in a mousetrap and she paid for her theft.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sRDK1vMJvItywu1jNXN0pqnPXP4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14599,"logo_path":"/hz8piJ9Np1MswUyav0JDNGf42pO.png","name":"Soyuzmultfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1967-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Four from the Same Yard","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
