Telling tales from a grand menu of culinary temples as well as digging into the greatness and flaws of Guide Michelin in this golden age of gastronomy. Because we share a great love for the industry that also includes a realistic understanding of things behind the picturesque scenes of the--perhaps--greatest, most creative and dynamic industry in the world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sDV9Se6BjCpaWrAaGTJPoPXrX2E.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2017-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Michelin Stars: Tales from the Kitchen","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
