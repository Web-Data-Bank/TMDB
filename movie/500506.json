Madvo’s films document a moment when traditional military celebrations began to appear against the backdrop of modernizing Canadian cities. The incongruity between modern cityscapes and military marches reveals the coexistence of two vastly different expressions of statecraft. The residue of this unresolved juxtaposition continues to this day, and is taken up in new footage which builds upon the themes identified in Madvo’s images.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2B5yFwe8bVmNlfHXhrRMS9235do.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2018-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fanfare","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
