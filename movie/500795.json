The city, art, his regular, middle-class existence and his marriage to Ana are all behind him. Now he is alone. Giorgi goes into isolation on a small barren island in a simple hut by the sea. In an inhospitable environment, surrounded only by a handful of strangers, between chicken farming and duck hunting, he is trying to pick up the pieces of his life. But his wounds are deep, and the shadows of his happy past repeatedly catch up with him.","popularity":0.689,"poster_path":"/ydRBqlz9fwxTrpYOcWmzZSGn1qU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94802,"logo_path":null,"name":"Artizm","origin_country":"GE"},{"id":94803,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gemini","origin_country":""},{"id":143406,"logo_path":null,"name":"Georgian National Film Centre","origin_country":""},{"id":51654,"logo_path":"/qTkVCfQFiM0q9sYn9pXKOsZdH2B.png","name":"Momento Film","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":2302,"logo_path":"/rPXEdpqwFycAY9ZgrAJXv13qcWW.png","name":"Svenska Filminstitutet","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GE","name":"Georgia"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2018-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Horizon","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3}
