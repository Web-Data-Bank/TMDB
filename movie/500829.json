Obvious question would be why didn't the cameraman warn him? The film tells the story of two explorers, George Breakston and Yorke Coplen, setting out to make a photographic record of animal life, and the lives of the tribes they encounter along the way. It is broken up into three segments---the journey from Nairobi to the Land of the Pgymies; the trip from there to the territory of the Masai tribe; and the Masai tribe itself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/io99xFmh9T12U4L4ZftSId0Arbr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1950-07-28","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jungle Stampede","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
