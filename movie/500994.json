Titled Hane’elam (The Disappeared) in Hebrew, the original film was intended to address a contentious subject in Israeli society and one of the military’s absolute taboos – the rising number of soldier suicides. The ambitious production was of a scope rarely seen in the local film industry at the time and included hundreds of soldier-extras, an entire armored brigade, military helicopters, and special operations personnel. With a lavish budget and a cast of leading Israeli actors, shooting commenced in multiple locations around the country, among them also a top-secret missile base. Soon after editing began and preparations for its commercial, nation-wide distribution were underway, The Disappeared disappeared.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yDHHvmazPUN1zt6PEejORlGkHRi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2018-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Disappeared","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
