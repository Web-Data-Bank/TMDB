With Prohibition still a relatively recent memory, many thought advertising beer on TV would be in bad taste. Commercials of this type were initially restricted to evening showings only, with Sundays completely off limits. However, with television sets quickly becoming a fixture in bars and taverns, advertisers realized that they had a unique opportunity to market directly to their customer at the barstool. So beer commercials became a fixture in the landscape of 1950s and 60s television, with companies scrambling to sign up beloved celebrities to pitch their product.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beer Commercials Of The 50s & 60s","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
