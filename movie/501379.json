She has since become a total hermit and spends her time creating art out of rocks from the nearby creek. It is a never-ending project. Ingrid peels off the layers of this woman's persona, questioning what would drive a successful Texas fashion designer to leave her profession and family to immerse herself in nature and become an entirely self sufficient woman of the woods.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/d1Fk3fCQkuztF57lJK3UzPypmov.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ingrid","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
