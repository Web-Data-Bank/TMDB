In Sanrizuka, people were weary of the violence and the airport was well under construction. As for Ogawa Productions, they invited criticism by pulling out and moving to a quiet village in northern Japan. But when protesters back in Sanrizuka erected a tall tower at the end of one runway, they sent a crew to document what happened. This became the final film of the Sanrizuka Series.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jeQIERlSKvfE20N4E3yX0n8C70a.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84096,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ogawa Productions","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1977-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sanrizuka: The Sky of May","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
