But something isnâ€™t quite right. Soviet troops, the Wehrmacht and American soldiers in Iraq seem to be co-existing in the same peaceful woods. They speak awkwardly about war memories that could never have been their own. And yet they know them by heart. A lighthearted film connecting imagination and storytelling to the reality of war.","popularity":0.7,"poster_path":"/7872d6BpMwtR4M8nYWcnpeJtB3x.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2018-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Remembered Film","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":11}
