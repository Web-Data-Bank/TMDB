Jimmy Story is the name of a fictional character that Billy Yeager created for the film Jimmy's Story (Billy Yeager's first feature film), in which a musician ponders the meaning of life.  Billy Yeager began to realize the negative side of the music industry and began to loathe what he had once desired.  Understanding the significance of producing a film and presenting it to the public, and infused with a sense of purpose as an artist, Yeager decided he wanted to challenge the audience's perception about fame and success, and society's celebrity obsession, while also exposing the media, which promote sensational news and trivial matters to the public.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nL6R9FAfxkb9gUvFdKsQovfkO6J.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"To everything there is a season, A time for every purpose under heaven.","title":"Jimmy's Story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
