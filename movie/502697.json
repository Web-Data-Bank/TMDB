Britain's top rock climbers Jerry Moffatt and Ben Moon take you on a rollercoaster road trip from the classic gritstone crags of the UK's Peak District to the mecca of European and World climbing in Fontainebleau, France. Also starring climbing hero Sean Myles, the late and great Kurt Albert and French climbing legend Marc Le Menestrel. A must watch for all boulderers, with an unforgettable pumping soundtrack. The climax of the film is Moon's ascent of Fred Nicole's Karma (V11) - other highlights include Moffatt's 'hair-raising' drive, in his Lancia Evolution, from Sheffield to Stanage and some amazing training scenes; all great fun and reminder of how climbing used to be.","popularity":0.62,"poster_path":"/6KpQ40xbmZpdwKDeLYAIhrpsmqo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100503,"logo_path":null,"name":"Positive Power Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Ben Moon and Jerry Moffatt on the ultimate bouldering road trip...","title":"The Real Thing","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
