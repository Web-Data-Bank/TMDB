PHOENIX, in her 40s and an unmarried writer, wants a child via IVF; BUTTERFLY, in her 20s, entangled with a man of power, aborts one. Viewers walk along the chilly interiors of the nightmares of the two women haunted by the spirit of the crushed fetus who lives on. The film is a eulogy of life lost. Defying genre conventions, C/O BUTTERFLY is a hybrid of styles of documentary, psycho drama and animation. Poetic and sometimes surreal, the film explores the core issues of human dilemma all associated with womb, the source of life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oJ745FwczYeZqN9RMHnMX4ilI58.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"C/O Butterfly - A Rhapsody of the Womb","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
