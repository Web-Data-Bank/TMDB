Four boys are trying their hardest, and as the list goes on they start to struggle, it even looks like someone is losing his breath. In the end they have named 879 players.  The short film Dream of Championship is a story about fandom. It depicts the kind of passion that motivates school children to memorize names in such numbers that would impress any history teacher.  Dream of Championship is Sophia Ehrnrooth’s directorial debut. She got the idea for the film from her 8-year-old son who recited nearly one hundred exotic names in the backseat of the car.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iPmw280fxMM0K2vwy2HorPeEPXi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2018-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dream of Championship","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
