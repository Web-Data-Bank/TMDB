In the first, the painter Gigliola Carretti is engaged in an action with a series of sexually explicit props, making the activity resemble the brushing of teeth; in the second, the director herself is seen from behind, seated on a toilet. The film ends with the almost abstract view of cascades of the fountains of Turin.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bdYYuCZqgfF1dUITcoBYojIrae7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1970-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dissolvimento","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
