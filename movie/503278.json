Rather than mount a traditional tour to promote a book's publication, Atwood conceived and executed something far more ambitious and revelatory--a theatrical version of her novel. Along the way she reinvented what a book tour could (and maybe should) be. But Atwood wasn't selling books as much as advocating an idea: how humanity must respond to the consequences of an environmentally compromised planet before her work of speculative fiction transforms into prophesy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ybhBQ3UhlD9Vh1ABvRWWhwWiiLW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109947,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sphinx Productions","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2010-08-02","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Wake of the Flood","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
