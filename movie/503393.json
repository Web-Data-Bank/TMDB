A long monologue goes on, while the images of the casting, of the rehearsals, of the set, flow. Lead actress Paloma Calle and the whole crew are accused of destroying the deep artistic and personal bind between Salani and his actress. In doing so, they helped in making the two drift apart. The film is now over, but emotions and feelings felt don't seem to fade out. The frames become the background of a love letter which is violent and desperate, the sign of wasted time, of the bitterness of what is and what could have been.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xvsiNDLreLNjM6hoR3kWSrXiqtK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2006-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Il peggio di noi","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
