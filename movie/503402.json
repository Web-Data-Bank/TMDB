Digging in inside. Ink spills: spilt nothing or at least no thing that I was fast enough to film. Light shines on mangled legs, basking like a cat, working on a cut. Sixteen bi-packed, rewind knob, winding back for density; covering the singular moments of time that have already unwound out of the room. Thought in images: ideas and images for a film that will never be made but I make in my head as I check to see if the stove gas is secretly on over and over. And over again. I will not go outside today. It is simply time for an afternoon in to myself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A6lQ1Luv9WBeBQbYKouXxmheY2U.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Afternoon In","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
