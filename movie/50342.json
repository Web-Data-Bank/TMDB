Seeing this, her best friend Yvonne encourages her to go out with Hou so she can forget her misery and start over. As time passes, Winnie realises that the relationship with Ray is so alike her previous relationship with Seth, and when things seem to be running smoothly, the relationship begins to sours, just like with Seth. She begins to doubt his feelings and the lines between reality and fantasy start blurring again for her, leading her to question: did this all exist in the first place?","popularity":1.882,"poster_path":"/ckdO48tEcCqeohkglioyYnDcgyy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78213,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universe Entertainment Limited","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2006-10-26","revenue":749981,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Diary","video":false,"vote_average":6.068,"vote_count":22}
