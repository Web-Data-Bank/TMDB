One example of his tireless search and research are the Geschichten vom Kübelkind, which he co-directed with Ula Stöckl in 1969/70, 22 absurdly funny, subversive and anarchistic short films of different lengths, which consciously oppose all conventions, with incredible success. The films remain unrivalled in their Dadaistic inventiveness.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2lHfUBx1rBxSKjOAvg8oPMsiiKE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20121,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fiction FACTory Filmproduktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2018-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Film Beyond Cinema: The Dumpster Kid Experiment and Other Utopias","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
