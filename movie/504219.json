Two weeks before the name NOAH echoed, the band experienced the toughest moment: Ariel should be languishing in jail due to his alleged role in the case of the nasty video. Their beliefs are tested. They crashed out whilst at the top glory.  The presence of David and the verdict of his illness makes Noah unite and become stronger than ever. They are convinced that the missing piece would go back and have another chance to make the band big, even bigger than before.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4NWorX6huVYHS6h6yTOLZVL1XU0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100816,"logo_path":null,"name":"Musica Studio's","origin_country":""},{"id":77606,"logo_path":null,"name":"700 Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":100817,"logo_path":null,"name":"Berlian Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"2013-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Noah, The Beginning","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
