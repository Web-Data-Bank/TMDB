We start out at a casting call, but before long we're firmly in the grip of hallucination, shedding our anxieties and evidently regressing to the animation era, a time when stunt chickens were mere chicklets. Friendly archetypes float in and out of what seems like our bedroom. The red-headed Jenny has returned, but this time she's squeaky and trusting. Unlike in Center Jenny, here our perspective is literally centered. The camera seems to be the in middle of the room, which is good, because we're too blissed out to move. Luckily, our hallucinations look directly at us.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6y0o3gA3oeCEHq19Vs3PUdbvXCj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Item Falls","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
