Chiao-Dahn might be a low-level gang member, but he's also a first-class goofball-more likely to break out dancing than to break the law. Ordered to kidnap and bring the beautiful but slightly spoiled Yumi to San Francisco, the seemingly hapless Chiao-Dahn soon finds himself at LAX, with no idea how to get to S.F. and saddled with a kidnapping victim who would rather go shopping than cooperate.","popularity":0.841,"poster_path":"/8yYbUxTSK1Cb10fVFiI1QGhcuri.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Egg","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
