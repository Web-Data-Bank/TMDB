He deserts his tiny village to pursue his dream, but when his voice breaks he sheepishly returns, resigned to attending but not singing at the Yom Kippur services. Upon his return, Oysher is informed that his son has died. Out of grief is wrought a miracle: Oysher's voice returns, more powerful than ever. After performing the Day of Atonement services, Oysher suddenly collapses, peacefully joining his son in death. If you wish to see the touching Overture to Glory, by all means seek out a decent print; many extant copies are so washed out that, not only are the English subtitles unreadable, but it's extremely difficult to tell one actor from another.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5av9X94viPNW5pnlJFBUjDrTdfv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":144262,"logo_path":null,"name":"Elite Productions Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1940-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Yiddish","iso_639_1":"yi","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Overture to Glory","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
