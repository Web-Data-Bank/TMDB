Blackstar sees Joslin and partner Mark Massi fleshing out their enduring commitment and obvious love for one another amidst the insecurity that a self-conscious documentary lens instills. As interviews with Joslin’s mother, father, and brothers attempt to break down the legitimacy of Joslin and Massi’s romance, the pair use everything at their disposal, including inspiration from gay revolutionaries and painfully honest conversations, to hold up their ​“abnormality” as a point of pride rather than shame. – Shayna Warner","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bSGw71AKaLrdtTa5MrUUgf7qeaJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":193949,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alchemedia","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1976-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blackstar: Autobiography of a Close Friend","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
