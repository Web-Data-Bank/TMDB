That is what the Grail is: the achievement's completion.","popularity":0.672,"poster_path":"/6PLPVVTHb6m2LWVy7PN9U5IPnGp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1980-07-25","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Graal","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
