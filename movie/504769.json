Hercules faced 12; they take on 13.  Emotions run high as a throng of Australian athletes rise to the top.  By the end of the competition, some learn tough lessons - that all that glitters isn't gold, or even bronze - and some learn that they're even stronger than they realized.  The best among them enter the pantheon of the CrossFit giants and earn the right to call themselves the \"Fittest on Earth\"","popularity":3.14,"poster_path":"/6sMjf473wpucvBGnjUyavzeNcAe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":64596,"logo_path":null,"name":"CrossFit Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":119,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Redeemed and the Dominant: Fittest on Earth","video":false,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":26}
