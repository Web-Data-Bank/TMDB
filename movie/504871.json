Based on a stage play, this DV feature traces the poignant trajectory of a rebel whose dream of world revolution first landed him in battles against British colonialism in the 70s, and later on his deathbed in the mid-90s, in agonies over the uncertain fate of a revitalized China. Revealing a little-known chapter of rebellion and idealism, THE LIFE AND TIMES OF WU ZHONG XIAN is a timely, resonant docu-drama for today's Hong Kong, China, and our ideologically-disillusioned era.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cAo7u6795H7kyvZQzXQutR4yfFf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100938,"logo_path":null,"name":"Riverdrive Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":100937,"logo_path":null,"name":"Asian People's Theatre Festival Society","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2003-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Life and Times of Wu Zhong Xian","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
