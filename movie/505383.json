Featuring John Thaw as the irascible Detective Inspector Regan and Dennis Waterman as his loyal 'oppo' Detective Sergeant Carter, Regan was an immediate critical and ratings hit, resulting in four series of The Sweeney and two successful feature films.  Jack Regan is a good copper, but his tough, intuitive style is becoming unfashionable in a Scotland Yard seeking a new image. When a policeman is mysteriously murdered, Regan breaks all the rules to find the killer - but he finds there are men in the Flying Squad prepared to break him.","popularity":1.177,"poster_path":"/8xGqjLnWavShNOCb4yF8wRjCRLH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5645,"logo_path":"/bKcQzzCVVeqgby86hAqKm5iVuzi.png","name":"Talkback Thames","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":26554,"logo_path":"/8KCY7SFDapSTQhEVH6jQMaabCmV.png","name":"FremantleMedia","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1974-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The original armchair cinema pilot for 70's UK TV series THE  SWEENEY","title":"Regan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
