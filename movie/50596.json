Bootleggers have long repeated a fictional claim that done in Paris, but that has long since been debunked.  In any case, this is the earliest footage of a complete concert of Black Sabbath in existence.  Here they perform many songs from their most recent album at the time, PARANOID, as well as several from their debut.  Interestingly, many of the songs from PARANOID feature their original pre-album lyrics - or Ozzy had simply forgotten the new ones!  The original show was split into two halves and includes some behind-the scenes clips of the band before the show.  Set List: Intro -> Paranoid , Hand Of Doom [alternate, improvised lyrics] -> Rat Salad , Iron Man, Guitar Intro -> Black Sabbath, N.I.B., Behind The Wall Of Sleep -> Jazz Improvisation, Walpurgis [a.k.a. War Pigs - alternate, improvised lyrics], Fairies Wear Boots.","popularity":1.187,"poster_path":"/8PrQawlizzCjApVEDpL4ivW700s.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1970-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black Sabbath - Live in Paris","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
