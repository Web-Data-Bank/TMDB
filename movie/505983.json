An immobile ferryboat. The characters are lonely passengers unconsciously seeking the feeling of belonging. Through what seems to be a moment of accidental physical contact, a new language starts to form between them. The film replaces words with gestures and it navigates around the structure of a relationship. The minimum amount of contact that takes place, becomes an alphabet. All the fragments of their encounter get mentally amplified by each one of them and end up forming a game.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tactilis","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
