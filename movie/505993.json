We rarely get to see her, maybe she likes her privacy. The narrated voice tells us something but not much about the main character. What we know is that she lived under bridges and has left a destructive life behind her. The film explores intuitive editing and the transcendence of meditative sound scape. The film was filmed in the last days of summer.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mokum Meermin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
