Technology became an essential part of our life. The development of haptic devices increases direct interactions leading to new gestures, where hands have a central role, involving the body and the skin. The distance between the user and the device gets closer, there is nothing in between anymore. This transition is mainly visible on the new generation, children learn very fast how to use tactile devices through sensitive, visual and playful interface. The aim of this project is to show the omnipresence of screens and visuals along with the speed of consuming them in a choreographic dance in between the body and a glass ball.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To be seen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
