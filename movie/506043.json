They lead us in their wake, from Rome to Paris, from Lisbon to London, from Parma to Venice. Always followed in the shadows, for obscure reasons, by a suspicious-looking Calabrian and a troubling cardinal, they make us explore the dark intrigues of the Vatican, the pangs of a fatal passion, a gruesome duel, banter at the court of Versailles and the convulsions of the French Revolution.","popularity":1.353,"poster_path":"/zlvEyMhwdmuYcJ66ve6wsVkcKnS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":44106,"logo_path":"/v4Wwng5Bgmp5HqgYIJXJLpChS7k.png","name":"Leopardo Filmes","origin_country":"PT"},{"id":3061,"logo_path":"/gseYJDkfTwGKG6qHbAa4SY9w1UV.png","name":"Alfama Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Black Book of Father Dinis","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":13}
