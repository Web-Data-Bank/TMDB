All typical New Yorkers: a Korean from Australia; a Belizean; a Jew from Brooklyn; a beach boy from California; and an Italian of Polish descent from Long Island. All in the New York state of mind: desperately in search of love--in all the wrong places. They make: three couples, five flings, four breakups. ER's boyfriend Joshua romances Karen's boyfriend Teo. Teo meets Frederic, whose boyfriend John romances ER. Frederic and John split then reconcile. ER and Joshua reconcile then split. Only Teo and Karen maintain their commitment to each other--he's gay, she's straight! Hey--nobody's perfect!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xK9myssjFwpa7WA3Zrp8RPg5m2q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nobody's Perfect","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
