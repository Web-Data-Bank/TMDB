Co-writer of the book \"Devant la recrudescence des vols de sacs à main\", Pilippe Roger has filmed Serge Daney confronting him with four major stages in the evolution of cinema : by screening extracts from films by Chaplin, Stevens, Eustache and Truffaut, adding rhythm into this vivid and intelligent, strict but piercing documentary. Serge Daney takes risks : he rushes forward, plying between ethic and aestheticism, destruction and salvation, past and present, Europe and America, fantasy and reality, cinema and psycho-analysis, literary and technical languages, watching and showing. There's enough material here to reconsider the video.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Du cinéma à la télévision, propos d'un passeur Serge Daney","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
