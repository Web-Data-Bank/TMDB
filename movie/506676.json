It is told entirely out of their self made videos which were posted on YouTube. They aren't Youtube stars, just teenagers talking to themselves and to anyone who is willing to listen. They all chose a camera rather than a notebook to record their diaries. These intimate documents of their formative years follow their journey from childhood into adulthood.","popularity":0.657,"poster_path":"/qJqYdeCumq7Atmdidl6gLKenIEg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In My Room","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2}
