Throughout the movie, the viewer gets to see a world of metalheads that is unlike the Hollywood movies.  Mainstream movies about metalheads are actually showing you posers, not metal people.  Hollywood only understands the mainstream, so their idea of metal is the faggy, pop and glam garbage like Motley Crue.  In the words of Bill (a character in this movie) the only time that a song should have the word “baby” in it is when the song is about killing babies.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sA8Nm2cSudNRUWMjixzjQRLPUYI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-08-26","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The ONLY metal movie that you'll need to see!","title":"Metalheads: The Good, the Bad, and the Evil","video":false,"vote_average":2.8,"vote_count":4}
