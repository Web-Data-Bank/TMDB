Exploring the company through archive film and photographs, as well as a reunion of the original members after 35 years, it climaxes with a vibrant performance of Pasuka's They Came by young black dancers. The film's fragmented style and lack of traditional talking heads can be challenging, but its historic value and rhythmic blend of sound and image reward the persistent viewer.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A4Slakn6W4h3ro75Os4hz2WRbas.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27901,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arts Council of Great Britain","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ballet Black","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
