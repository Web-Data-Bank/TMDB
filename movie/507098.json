Director Julia Ostertag, camera in hand, takes us through a tour of unusual (and some not) clubs throughout the city during a period of a few months. We encounter known personalities, drag queens and other night creatures, all a tad peculiar. Sexuality without borders, and breaking taboos are the main themes addressed. The documentary, above all, questions the concept of 'normalcy' and the many prejudices established by society as a whole, and the different segments of society shown on film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ssOmnWCHuALAUVVywKV3B988y34.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gender X","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
