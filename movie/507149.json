Faced with the modern injustices of work visas, checkpoints, harassment and prejudices, these brave individuals resist oppression and take small steps each day to build a sense of peace, mutual respect and hope. Filmmaker Elle Flanders draws on her own story of growing up with Zionist grandparents who were intimately involved in the founding of the state of Israel. Their haunting archival home movies evoke an idealized Israel of the 1950s and summon larger questions about humanity, conflict and nationalist aspiration.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/iTKXuH8JeHD26K6nN6ZrNOyuIQm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zero Degrees of Separation","video":false,"vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3}
