Trying to find a job in a recession-plagued economy proves to be the least of his worries. Apprehensive about his attraction to his best friend and roommate, Steve, Michael seeks refuge from his confusion in the arms of beautiful Julia Hencock, a model with a dubious part-time job-and an even more obscure past. Julia has her own problems. Her precarious romance with Michael soon turns into a balancing act: she must satisfy both a boyfriend-whose true sexual proclivities she suspects-as well as her nightly clients, while evading a killer who knows that her testimony could land him in the electric chair. And, sensing Steve's jealousy of her attachment to Michael, she fears that Steve might betray her ultimate secret. Both Michael and Julia must eventually conquer their respective demons.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iOenPwbpJQCUcJDwCo8i8r7eEb4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Limits to Ambition","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
