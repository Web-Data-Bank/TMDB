Rev. Perry is perhaps best known as the founder of the Metropolitan Community Church - the first church to recognize the spiritual needs of the gay community - but his \"firsts\" don't stop there. He was the first openly gay person to serve on the Los Angeles County Commission on Human Relations. In 1969, Perry performed the first public same-sex wedding in the U.S., and in 1970 he filed the first-ever lawsuit seeking legal recognition for same-gender marriages. From presidential advisor to outspoken advocate, Perry has been on the front lines leading the charge for equal rights and protections for gay men and lesbians the world over as well as providing a place for all people, gay and straight, to worship side by side. This film celebrates his life and his legacy.","popularity":0.902,"poster_path":"/sjKdArbslcstnD8LWPnaVDzbB5C.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Call Me Troy","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2}
