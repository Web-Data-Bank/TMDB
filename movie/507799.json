Upon entering the nearest town to cash in, they quickly become entangled with a dangerous outlaw who has eyes on their fortune. After the rock and child go missing, Jorge teams up with a conniving Chinese immigrant to find his son and get back what is his, but not before running into a surplus of outrageous characters including an unsavory hunting party...or killing each other first in this wacky adventure!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/h7hTwozRuZMwHD3bNviLp8QYccY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98904,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wild Dogs Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gold Mountain","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
