Stephen, 23, a young actor, David, 30, a commercials director and John, 33, a once famous soap opera actor now doing very bad fringe theatre.  Stephen and John are both struggling young actors who live in a very open and proudly gay section of Dublin. When not calling upon their manager to find them acting work, Stephen and John enjoy the ups and downs of the single life. While John pines for his super-masculine imprisoned lover, and flees from the advances of a scatologically-obsessed admirer, Stephen gets the opportunity to kill two birds with one stone. He's started dating a charming, very cute commercial director named David who wants to work with him in both a professional and personal sense.","popularity":0.988,"poster_path":"/g5PcSAxjrXWTX5nex6b725kImEj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fur Coat and No Knickers","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
