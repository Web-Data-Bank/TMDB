In a country that has become increasingly fundamentalist, many regarded the couple with hostility. Allegations of drug use, pornography and rent boys circled. Shortly before his death, Scott came to international acclaim helping hostages during the 2000 coup. Was his murder a political assassination; the result of a soured love affair or an act of insanity? This award winning documentary uses the murders to examine Fiji’s history over the past 50 years. Narrated by Scott’s brother, it’s a moving tale of colonial privilege, evangelical Christianity and a country still deeply divided.","popularity":0.823,"poster_path":"/beHgsv3z5kaqGTQYNIaE4VrkA1Y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Coup.
