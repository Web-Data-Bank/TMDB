The idea of producing European films financed by American funds, in fact, originated in Italy with Paramount Pictures. Masterpieces such as Nights of Cabiria, Romeo and Juliet and The Conformist, to name just a few, were created precisely thanks to the work of these two men. The exclusive testimonies of Gioia Levi and Tony Luraschi, the children of the two executives, describe how their fathers were not only businessmen but how their lives were dedicated entirely to cinema.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3GFCSfU2LKi9HbVTmXNObBACPfe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Italian Jobs - Paramount Pictures e l'Italia","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
