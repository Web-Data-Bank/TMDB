In the geometric part of the film, Hultén works with the rhythmic displacement of contrasts and patterns in bright primary colors. Geometric images are intertwined with jazz to illustrate analogy of form. The photographic part consists of family sequences of various persons. The catalogue of Arbetsgruppen för film of 1960 lists the work as unfinished.
