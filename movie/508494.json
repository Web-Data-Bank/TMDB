The husbands are all for this as they think it will cure their wives of being infatuated with this man-about-town. And they might run into some fun in Paris. Actually, the philanderer is the one who put the idea in their heads to go away so the coast will be clear for his marauding raid party, with no intentions of curing anybody of anything.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wwyJSybpKs2vLys39nPdxN8bIYs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":65204,"logo_path":null,"name":"Richard Wainwright Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1937-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Gay Spicy Farce","title":"School for Husbands","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
