The length of each filmstrip is determined by the distance between points on the artistâ€™s body, such as from fingertip to fingertip between outstretched arms, and bisecting the body along a posterior/anterior axis. During our experience of these moving images, the length of a strip of film becomes a measurement of time as the static marks incised into the black 16mm frames are perceived to be lines of light in motion.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/t50xBSTcUcrAYNBhxn3angIgvOm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":101674,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sundog Media","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Measure","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
