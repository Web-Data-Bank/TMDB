This peeking into their homes begins when Shir, Noy's younger sister, comes to visit him from the Kibbutz, when he'd rather throw her onto Mike - the perfect host. At his apartment, she is introduced to his anonymous blog on the Internet - an ongoing story in the first person, about a special air-hostess who lives in the shadows of the city, a bit like the author who invented her. Shir suggests giving her face to the storyteller, thus forcing Mike out of his self-afflicted anonymity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/586QJKI6oAHbBUYFQemb2j0ZRNA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"AirTime","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
