The film is divided in two parts, with the protagonist, a young woman – Jagoda – connecting them as a ghostly presence, bringing hope and reconciliation within the two narratives. She is a student visiting family in the summer, living in the declining villages of former Yugoslavia, overlooking the Adriatic coast. In the first story she bonds with a cousin in his mid-thirties, who is building a house in the village, but has no one to marry and live with him. In the second, she helps a teenage cousin understand that his nation is no better than others, and that they all have to learn to live together on the recently established borders.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cIXgtQHdSWkz07LaHZt4Tkchkrv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":68318,"logo_path":null,"name":"All Inclusive Films Belgrade","origin_country":"RS"},{"id":3252,"logo_path":null,"name":"Balkan Film","origin_country":"RS"},{"id":101749,"logo_path":null,"name":"Balkan Kino","origin_country":""},{"id":68799,"logo_path":null,"name":"Drina Film","origin_country":""},{"id":6108,"logo_path":null,"name":"Media Plus","origin_country":"RS"},{"id":101750,"logo_path":null,"name":"MediaPlus Belgrade","origin_country":""},{"id":101751,"logo_path":null,"name":"Montenegro Max Films","origin_country":"ME"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BA","name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"iso_3166_1":"ME","name":"Montenegro"},{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"}],"release_date":"2018-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Borders, Raindrops","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
