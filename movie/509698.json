When his father-in-law falls ill, Chanda and the children travel by boat to see him, but the trio perish when the boat meets with an accident. Devastated, Kashiram turns to alcohol but still continues to sell toys for a living. Four children, Ram, Rahim, Tom and Rani, decide that the only way Kashiram can be happy is by becoming a father, so they select the village's naive flower-selling belle, Lajwanti, to bear him a child. Then when Kundan attempts to molest Lajwanti, Kashiram comes to her rescue and warms Kundan not to molest anyone or else he will be killed. Shortly thereafter, the Police find an intoxicated and blood-soaked Kashiram over Kundan's lifeless body and arrest him. Unable to recollect what actually happened, amidst rumors of a haunted house, Kashiram may find himself in for life in prison or even the gallows.","popularity":1.09,"poster_path":"/uLQHphhCIL8m34P9RexzGgkIjiD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1970-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":133,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bachpan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
