Central to this is the Marowijne River with its villages, and how the rich society of Creoles (Afro-Surinamese), Hindustani, Javanese, Chinese, Boeroes (descendants of Dutch farmers' immigrants), Indians and Maroons live together. Wide rivers flow through the jungles of Suriname, mostly peaceful, but sometimes furiously against the rocks. Indians hunt for fish, while Marons prove that they are masters of driving their narrow boats. The Surinamese are sensitive musicians when they play their flute, which is shaped like bamboo. The jungle is a vibrant sea of green and there are flowers of every color that you can imagine. This is the interior of Suriname. The majority of the population lives on the coast, where the capital Paramaribo is also situated, a city that is lively and contains many different population groups, with their own clothing and language.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rjRzFEpv3b5M8GvqkrThmCbjI1H.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1961-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Faja Lobbi","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
