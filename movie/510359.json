With myriad images and his trademark candid narration, Yang leads us though this beguiling era of sexual discovery, politics, love and loss.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3JSAN75XFF14ngEWeaMb0nFw0nb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-02-19","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"William Yang: Friends of Dorothy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
