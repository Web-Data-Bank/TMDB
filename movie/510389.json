Emma is now a pop culture loving, rom com obsessed, Zen seeking Wiccan lesbian living in New York City and working in a magic shop called Enchantments. In this re-telling of Jane Austen's classic we see bi-racial families and relationships and lgbtq relationships and realize that love is love. It doesn't matter how one loves, as long as it's true. It's a shiny, happy, campy love story like you've never seen before.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mcpIUD2VquZYIxBdvl9EPN28knY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Enchantments","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
