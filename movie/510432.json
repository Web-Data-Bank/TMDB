It tackles issues of identity, displacement, the spectre of comparison, 2nd class citizenship, nationality and the privileged position of belonging in the academe, all disguised in the everyday struggles of sustaining a long distance relationship. Seen from the point of view of the one who writes to a lover left behind, (Mahal, 2017) serves as a reference to the daily battles of a scholar who is burdened with the choice of reconciling the need to find solutions to the social problems of her country and the desire to live a reactionary life with the person she loves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/c0cw11vQasqMqxcy30yTStbvRtd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-03-09","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love, 2017","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
