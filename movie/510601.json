Watch JT Holmes, Seth Wescott, Caroline Gleich, Steven Nyman, Marcus Caston and more as they pursue turns on the mountains of our dreams: Chamonix, Alaska's Chugach, the Chilean Andes, Utah's Wasatch and the mightiest range of them all: the Himalaya. These athletes are masters in their element, and with every cliff drop, perfect line and neck-deep powder turn, they motivate us. Warren Miller once said, \"A pair of skis are the ultimate transportation to freedom,\" and this year, we're chasing storms, snow, lines that live on the world's highest peaks, and the freedom that these things grant us.","popularity":0.651,"poster_path":"/jvnI8uHjdUQIbx3qIHOUZKQlR16.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17183,"logo_path":null,"name":"Warren Miller Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chasing Shadows","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
