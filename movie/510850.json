In between a young ingénue cast in her first big role, the Hoffmann rehearsals, the theatre director and his stage director exchanging cynicisms, a budding love affair. Gründgens at his most repulsive, trying to woo both lovers. And a hair-raising finale. Add to this some snappy dialogue and \"pre-code\" scenes that make you sit up and stare.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yhVcuhxgaj377CU8I41sUvp5040.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89292,"logo_path":null,"name":"Carl Froelich-Film GmbH","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1930-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fire in the Opera House","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
