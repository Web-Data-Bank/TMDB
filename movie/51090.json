The letters tell her what to do if her life hasn't turned out the way she thought it should, when she was living in poverty with her mother and brother in a small village in southern France. She decides to go back to her birthplace to get the lawyer to stop the letters, but also to visit her childhood sweetheart and her long-forgotten brother, in order to find peace within herself.","popularity":5.945,"poster_path":"/gRCiYeVgQS9OBdCu6nigeqcqUuO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2908,"logo_path":"/8TnTh3wLfwCHMryk1ujHdxEG2Kc.png","name":"Mars Distribution","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":11773,"logo_path":"/8fCjsqh43LbPV6pm3SfR5Jx64GU.png","name":"Artémis Productions","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":83,"logo_path":"/9OQ0rm55xtlgX7KcAKMUePJSrQc.png","name":"France 2 Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":57752,"logo_path":"/2k3j1B8TEbZPQgckP6zh75pIb4s.png","name":"Nord-Ouest Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":109756,"logo_path":"/sudlIoNIIrKmVWaYD2ZVo9HGogW.png","name":"Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2010-07-28","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"With Love... from the Age of Reason","video":false,"vote_average":5.529,"vote_count":105}
