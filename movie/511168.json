The audacity of Federico Moura at the head of the La Plata's band exceeded the limits of rock and is still a source of art-pop knowledge. Imágenes Paganas explores that tension and rejection in times of dictatorship, a scourge that the Moura family paid with the disappearance of Federico's older brother. The documentary by Costantino inaugurates a time of historical reparation with Federico Moura as a warrior of modernity.","popularity":1.204,"poster_path":"/wNgRY67A7fIcDvfjUmUqqmNumPV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102040,"logo_path":null,"name":"Buen Día Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2013-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Imágenes paganas","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":12}
