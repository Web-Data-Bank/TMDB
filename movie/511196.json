The title is a play on the French quatuor, meaning quartet, but the chorus is not the usual alley-cat variety. The cat in this film is talented indeed. He is both pianist and piano, trumpet and trumpeter and, if need be, even becomes the music--a pulsing rock and roll--or a whole swarm of alley cats.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/v2veCHSp153XhGdzNha4mddnV8Z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Catuor","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
