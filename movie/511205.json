Sometimes they move against backgrounds, sometimes they incorporate them. Electro-acoustical music further heightens the other-worldly atmosphere of this experimental dance film.

Film without words.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wsBvDkK7IAtXyUgS6so4Lwd9oFA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ni scène ni coulisses","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
