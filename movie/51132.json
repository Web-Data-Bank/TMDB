It deals with every historical and contemporary aspect of hemp usage and cultivation (mainly in the U.S.), which turns out to be a lot. From describing the production of a fiber much more durable and economic than wood, the documentary discusses hemps multilateral uses as e.g. food products, as a non-polluting fuel and as a pharmaceutical product with much less grievous side-effects than chemical pharmaceutical products. The film also investigates why America went from a country which produced vast quantities of the non-narcotic industrial hemp, to the complete ban on hemp production in 1938. This story in particular is interesting, and it points out that the large oil-based industries actually had a key role in the aforementioned ban. Food for thought! The conclusion of the documentary could be that hemp may prove to be a valid alternative to both oil and wood in the future.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4SI0pZ9RSHB4u3VxZmS2g1WZx52.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hemp Revolution","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
