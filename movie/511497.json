Like the dance beat pulsating throughout the film, the bully's intimidation of a smaller victim is unrelenting; no one stops the dance until serious harm is inflicted. While Bully Dance offers no simple solutions, it does compel viewers--teachers, parents and children--to take stock of their actions and to find ways to end peer abuse.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vt9rqvX5OcjnDFd8TiG5Tn2VILK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bully Dance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
