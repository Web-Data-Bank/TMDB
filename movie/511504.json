Once the men arrive, they all look for work but find nothing. When opportunities finally arise, Kwan Ming lets his friends have the best jobs: tailor, shoemaker and baker. Kwan takes a lowly position as helper to a mean store owner. His cruel boss makes three impossible demands: that Kwan Ming find him a woolen suit that never tears, boots that never wear out and bread that won't go stale. Kwan Ming's generosity of spirit pays off when his friends come to his aid.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/yvk0HYfUqg8UTC2CcuCEdwsyaE8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Friends of Kwan Ming","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
