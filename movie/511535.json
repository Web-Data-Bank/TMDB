Proud of his work, the boy wants to impress his grandfather and journeys through the woods to find him. Along the path Maq meets a curious traveller named Mi’gmwesu. Together they share stories, medicine, laughter and song. Maq begins to care less about making a good impression and more about sharing the knowledge and spirit he's found through his creation. It is only when Maq joins his grandfather that he understands who Mi’gmwesu really is.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vVDjtjGpUnprq14TyppTNHm7T9S.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maq and the Spirit of the Woods","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
