Oma's home for half a lifetime is brimming with memories that warm her heart yet bring tears to her eyes. On this day, her house stands empty, all the fragments of her life packed neatly into boxes. Oma is moving from Maple Street, where she lived for most of her life, to a senior's residence where she doesn't know anyone. Watching these events unfold is granddaughter Emily, a young girl full of wide-eyed enthusiasm. She senses that her grandmother isn't sure she will like her new home. Wishing to help, Emily does something to ease the burden of such a momentous change in all their lives.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bYE2dM0Zg05XCMjPJiMURiFhOdU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oma's Quilt","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
