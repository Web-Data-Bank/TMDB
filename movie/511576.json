Excerpts from family films, interviews, and clips from some of Jutra's well-known works are seamlessly intertwined with these sequences, forming a portrait of a man whose life was devoted to creativity. Jutra is simultaneously a homage, a love letter to cinema, and the dramatic story of a brilliant artist whose life was all-too-short.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5UNYiGKHqNc0h8EHMaMkTTBD4NU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2014-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jutra","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
