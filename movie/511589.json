Back in the era of the Walkman, Pac-Man, and Wayne Gretzky, Hart finds himself lost amongst his pubescent peers. He lacks the confidence to ask the girl of his dreams out on a date, and he’s just discovered that he’s required to take shop class, when he’d been hoping to register for Home Economics instead.  Hart dreads shop class and his terrifying teacher, Mr. P. Threatened by the school bully, and lectured by Mr. P. on the horrifying consequences of using industrial power tools, Hart wants nothing more than to follow the scent of freshly baked cookies all the way back to that Home Ec. room down the hall.  Try as he might, Hart just can’t succeed in shop. He fails assignment after assignment as Mr. P. continues to break him down. But he perseveres, and discovers a few things about himself along the way.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gs1wKKzQcg7N8ew1vbP2zlygBtZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shop Class","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
