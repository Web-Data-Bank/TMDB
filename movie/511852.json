He wants to find out if Judaism is more tolerant of his sexuality than his Catholic faith, but is it a case of better the devil you know? Simon is a Roman Catholic, but became disillusioned when he realised that being gay he could not marry in the eyes of God. His religion didnâ€™t seem to impact his lifestyle until he met his Jewish boyfriend Matthew, whose synagogue allows same-sex marriage. In this one-off documentary Simon goes on a personal mission to discover if, as a gay man, he could convert to Judaism and whether it is worth sacrificing his Catholic upbringing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hSdl3Y82G0mcIH6GOEQsQtFFtsW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Big Gay Jewish Conversion","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":4}
