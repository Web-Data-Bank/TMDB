Rachit is an urbane guy and Shikhar has a 'small-town' rustic charm - the differences between them are evident during their interactions. But as the evening progresses, Rachit recollects some forgotten memories from a distant past. Together, they revisit the roads not taken; and, the lines between the past and the present get blurred. Set in Mumbai, India, this romantic drama is a contemporary take on the life and relationships of a single professional gay man - his understanding of his identity, missed opportunities, and personal choices.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3uUhtuhXrlZ91KgyJvtPvQpcWgE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2017-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Opportunity","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":4}
