As a combination of fiction and documentary, the film could be classified as a ‘UMO’: Unidentified Movie Object! On the one hand: a comedy about a female director who plays with fire by testing out polyamory on her own relationship. On the other hand: a serious, poised, and thought-through documentary with speakers who have reflected on the topic or who live it everyday.  Between the two, a grey area in which fiction gets entangled with reality. Will her sweetheart rise up to the challenge of polyamory? Will she finish her film?","popularity":0.659,"poster_path":"/21XfQYtClgs9bvtbkdWFxBHifjG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lutine","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
