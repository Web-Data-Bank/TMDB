Bodies, objects and natural features are shown from different perspectives and angles, proposing a sort of visual harmony within the silent film. Through geometry, texture, movement and stasis, Patella animates, creating a sense of communion with nature on a similar wavelength to Ana Mendietaâ€™s actions, and with a stark difference to the comparative coldness and objectivity that the work of land artists of the contemporary era would reflect.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iwMXO8N9ikqJIGM5QiIGuuZRG2h.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1967-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Terra animata","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
