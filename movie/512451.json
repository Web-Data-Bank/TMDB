In July 2009, Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Gerard Martinez walked into a Tampa Bay museum with a gun and killed 10 people - men, women and children - before turning the gun on himself. In the days leading up to the murders, he was making a documentary on what had become his obsession: Proving the existence of Mon Protecteur, a mythical French super hero. This documentary uses his footage, police evidence and interviews with his friends, family, colleagues, historians and others to paint a clear picture of the obsession that drove Martinez to the edge and to try to figure out if Martinez actually found the mythical hero or if he simply found a con man.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jY3eRSHg75QbjIxB67MgvD5pNEo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"What if you found the man who could save the world, but he didn't even want to save himself?","title":"Delsin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
