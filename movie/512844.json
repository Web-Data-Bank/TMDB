The film was shot but never finished. The incompleteness of Ruizâ€™s film is the starting point for Double Ghosts, an ongoing project seeking to think through divergent cultural, social and geographical contexts. Considering the echoes of unrealised political histories from the legacy of the short lived socialist government in Chile to life under martial law in both countries, Double Ghosts attempts to use the space of cinema as a site of projection between the past and the present.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wFhJynfMgjB85paVGvAYUTyv7a4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Double Ghosts","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
