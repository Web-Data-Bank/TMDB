The sportswomen chosen for this film compete in one-on-one sports, a metaphorical duality which expresses the two sides of the women’s identity – the dark and the light. This film is a visualisation of human duality, of the internal personal struggle, constant in both art and life. The documentary paints a portrait of each woman as a contemporary heroine fighting against adversity while at the same time tenaciously working towards their dreams and personal legends.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":27193,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fralita Films","origin_country":"LT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"2010-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"7 sins","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
