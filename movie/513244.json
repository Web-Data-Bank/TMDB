With trippy lyrics, a middle finger raised to all genres, and a tightly knit bond thanks to many years of friendship, the band is aiming to fly even higher. The film moves with the group from sold-out concerts to isolation in a bunker and a long trip to the Danish island of Bornholm. It depicts a band that tries to find a foothold in a time of unrest and upheaval – both internally in the band and the world in general. The front figure and perfectionist Niels Brandt balances between his own ambitions and a person who in essence is just 33-year-old Niels. But just as the five friends are on the verge of fulfilling the dream that they have harboured since childhood, Niels's creative driving force – his darkness – has suddenly disappeared. Does Niels have to look for his darkness again to be able to formulate his visions?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/d4BmA83SHo8sbWf8zkNQszTo9bB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Big as a sun","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
