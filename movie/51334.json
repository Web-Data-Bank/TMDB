While trying to get used to life in the big city, Aydın stumbles upon Mehtap, a young woman who works at a candy shop in Beyoğlu, and he falls for her. But there is no way that Aydın can make Mehtap realize that he even exists, just as Şevket, a young man who has dropped out of law school before starting to sell toy trains on the streets to make a living, cannot make Dilek, another girl who works at the same store, realize his feelings for her. When Dilek and Aydın meet, Aydın diverts his uncontrollable feelings toward Dilek.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/5uQNaElLbuHXZ1qHZq1y6uHozAZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14477,"logo_path":null,"name":"efLÂtunfilm","origin_country":"TR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"2009-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Five Cities","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":17}
