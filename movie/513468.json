Pourquoi?) is the last film of the 'K' series. Each frame of film was placed individually in the printer; the film consists in fact of individual frames, developed one by one (rather than a conventional camera roll), and placed at random on the printing stock. The question posed by the film is: how can one describe the position of the Algerian administration vis-a-vis Kabylie, which has been completely abandoned by central government? It's like a game of poker, is it not ... with the only possible response one of desolation and incomprehension. An original composition by Mr. Djamel Tareb will form the musical sound-track for the film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/y9shnes7Ecf0qmMV5WUOmzpS7Rv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"K (Acugher/Acimi)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
