With the decadence of 1920's Berlin, but all in a muddy field. A film of the dark, self-destructive side of creativity and the personal trauma behind it.","popularity":0.955,"poster_path":"/oN7CtIAxKrmFEJ4L1dUt82pm6Fr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lost in Vagueness","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
