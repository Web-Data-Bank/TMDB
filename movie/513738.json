The Saturday Nights songs are upbeat, pairing subtle but expressive lyrics with fast-paced, brazen electric guitar; the Sunday Mornings selections have a more reflective, subdued tone. Lead singer Adam Duritz starts the night off right with a raucous version of the CD opener “1492,” then sings of loss in the moody “Washington Square,” accompanied by piano and acoustic guitar. His no-holds-barred emotion also resonates in slower songs like “Le Ballet d'Or” and “When I Dream of Michelangelo.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Counting Crows: Live at Soundstage","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
