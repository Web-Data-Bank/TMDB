Heliopolis Heliopolis was created by an insurgent priest (whose name has been lost) as a tool to train students in the design of a revolutionary city meant to surpass the ancient city of Heliopolis. This in spite of the fact that the priest and his students appear never to have visited Heliopolis and based their model exclusively on texts and secondhand knowledge. Eventually this became a source of pride within the school and descriptions of Heliopolis gained a fantastical nature, becoming both meticulously elaborate and wildly implausible.  Heliopolis Heliopolis is a cinematic interpretation of the simulacrum and the hypnotic, trance-inducing ritual connected to its use.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kpq579vDZO2RseTI3ADwtSAieAx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heliopolis Heliopolis","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
