And a poet. The phenomenon of a rockstar stands outside of normality – is bigger than life. Recognizingly what we can say about Freddy, is that he is not normal – not on stage, nor in life.  Freddy’s creation and life are equivalent – he puts everything out there.  What makes Freddy interesting is not the social or textual play, but the ammount that he puts in. Possibility of total loss of self-control and the depth of a predictable human or metaphysical agony.  This is the story of the last real rockstar and poet, his work and of a punkbands anatomy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qkOI3v33g8zCN6r94PDVw4W9wNk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6154,"logo_path":"/5YKiuLl1qnTI3ZX5yxF8ZdtQ4GH.png","name":"Allfilm","origin_country":"EE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"2018-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"More than Life","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":1}
