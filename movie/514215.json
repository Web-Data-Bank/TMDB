It is a synthesis of liberated imagination and stringent structure; cross-medial concepts that embellish and enrich our existence, illumination and clarity, order and playfulness. But Bauhaus was never just an artistic experiment. Confronted with the social conditions of that particular time, as well as the experience of WWI, the movement concerned itself with the political and social connotations of design from the very outset. Hence, Bauhaus history is not just the history of art, but also the history of an era that stretches from the early 20th century to the modern day.","popularity":1.231,"poster_path":"/d9zne2Gca4WBlpxpNKGeSStqlEE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1235,"logo_path":"/lrS9d6tT20guiyUb279dLkmNwm0.png","name":"Neue Visionen","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2018-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bauhaus Spirit: 100 Years of Bauhaus","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":11}
