Likely the first, and only, 3D documentary of any Radio Hall of Fame recipient, this documentary was filmed in stereoscopic-3D four years before Herb Kent's death in October, 2016, bringing to an end over 70 years on air as a Chicago radio personality. Mr. Kent was the first African American inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame, the first African American employee of NBC network serving as intern to Hugh Downs, and holds the Guinness Book of World Records for the 'longest on air radio personality/male'. Herb speaks to the camera in his own words, and we are allowed to document the life and times of this radio legend. Using specialized film processing techniques referred to as Ultra-3D (U3D), anaglyph glasses can be used with virtual elimination of typical color distortions that have previously made anaglyphy 3D less desirable.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6CBtGKxAQe6ytM4LVR80InO69lz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Froze in My Clothes: Celebrating a Radio Icon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
