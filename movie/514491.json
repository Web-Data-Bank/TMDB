The parrot, seeing this, can't stand it, so he pulls out his copy of Mein Kramp, where the first tip is to sow suspicion to divide and conquer. If that wasn't obvious enough, the parrot does a quick Hitler impression. He suggests the dog bite the cat; the dog just goes back to sleep. Next, the parrot claws the dog and whispers to both - still no fight. He feeds Myrtle the Cat a bowl of catnip and they finally start fighting, until they knock the book down; when they realize what the parrot has done, they turn on him.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":3287,"logo_path":"/bz6GbCQQXGNE56LTW9dwgksW0Iw.png","name":"Screen Gems","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1942-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cholly Polly","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
