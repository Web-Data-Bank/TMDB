It is also Maria's home. One day, the burden of keeping lives together and the hotel standing falls on her shoulders. A young man who left Macau two decades ago returns, intent on revenge and reclaiming his mother's fortune – half the hotel. Inside the casino, Maria sings Fado and exotic dancers perform. It is against this illusory backdrop that the man lays eyes on Maria for the first time; they’re both mesmerized. The film cuts back and forth between film noir-style scenes of Macau’s past and present.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vEWuNs1E4fYN2qIZXVlf7ynqhw3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9020,"logo_path":"/qAcfiiC2WPGrfotZPnoHkDtQ6lr.png","name":"O Som e a Fúria","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"},{"iso_3166_1":"MO","name":"Macao"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2018-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Empire Hotel","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":4}
