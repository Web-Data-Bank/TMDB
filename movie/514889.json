These are the planes that were involved in aerial combat at every stage of the RAF's story, from the biplanes used in the early days of dogfighting in World War I to the beautiful Spitfire of the Battle of Britain, the plucky Lysander and on to mighty Vulcan nuclear bomber, as well as the Chinook helicopter and supersonic Typhoon that are still in service today. It is a story of amazing machines and epic battles, but above all it is the story of the men and women whose courage and ingenuity have been at the heart of the RAF for 100 years. On their journey Ewan and Colin meet an amazing cast of characters.","popularity":1.523,"poster_path":"/7zbn93Qq8nf8W3ia5MQ8NQ680r1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7710,"logo_path":"/iJQIjE9g4FqCDPLzxqoOfQ0e4Xx.png","name":"BBC One","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":12746,"logo_path":"/mnEp5e9oNxWy87BIwTpBDSEW5BZ.png","name":"Lion Television","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"RAF at 100 with Ewan and Colin McGregor","video":false,"vote_average":4.9,"vote_count":5}
