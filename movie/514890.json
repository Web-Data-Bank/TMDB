Over the course of a single season, director Zaheed Mawani gracefully captures delicate sequences such as a child interacting with a snake, or sacks of walnuts being laid gently across an attic bed. Stories attached to the forest are told and retold over the fire at night, adding a mythic dimension.","popularity":0.689,"poster_path":"/tLUsT6WUgTuGULY4zjYl0kk6pPE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"KG","name":"Kyrgyz Republic"}],"release_date":"2018-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kirghiz","iso_639_1":"ky","name":"??????"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Harvest Moon","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
