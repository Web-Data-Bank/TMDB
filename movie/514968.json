Three grandsons embark an anarchic journey into the past â€“ a complex road movie about intergenerational dialogue in Great Britain, Germany and Hungary. Granny Project is a seven-year-long investigation of three young men coming to terms with their heritage through the extraordinary lives of their grandmothers: an English spy, a dancer from Nazi Germany and a Hungarian communist Holocaust survivor. The film deals with classic values and taboo-like historical topics, and the method used is equally important as it gives an insight to the zeitgeist of the young today.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6DUzObTPzmIfx7ZESrM3T9jE2Me.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97123,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gallivant Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Granny Project","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
