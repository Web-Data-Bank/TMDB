Though an interrogation of two tough police detectives isn't enough, the guy, who has a doctor's degree in philosophy which makes his mind mingle with remorse, must find a way to get rid of this dirty money. Only the help of a prostitute and a former biker who came out of jail might get him out of trouble, especially that a gang leader is very weary to get his cash back or kill whoever is responsible for this mess. However, even the two bumbling detectives are monitoring the case as well.","popularity":8.989,"poster_path":"/3DXja79jYCmWxs2hWNIgLXl4F3n.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":280,"logo_path":"/1rwkrpgsc0pWmkvEOabbPzEsGLi.png","name":"Cinémaginaire","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2018-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":127,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fall of the American Empire","video":false,"vote_average":6.601,"vote_count":164}
