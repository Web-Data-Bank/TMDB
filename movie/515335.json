Steve opens his heart as he tells of childhood ridicule in the 50's, coming out and living openly gay during the decades of the 60s to the 80s- a period rife with homophobia- finding true love, dealing with tragedy and loss, loneliness and aging. His gradual evolution includes embracing sobriety, connecting with a long lost relative and discovering his spirituality only to find that he is in danger of losing his home and business. His entertaining reflections stimulate argument and offer us a refreshing appreciation of life, love and living.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3adQ9fHNOi9VDgMkQ1mV9PddDN3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Not a Still Life","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
