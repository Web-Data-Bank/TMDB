A woman searches an inner landscape, a space that closes it up and encloses it. Her dress, a projection of femininity, becomes her means of expression. The film silently moves to the point of confrontation by means of rhythmic editing; the woman opens the door to the outside world. This shocking moment of violent interaction is reinforced by the only sound in the film.","popularity":0.804,"poster_path":"/5McgEbh5INghp9FOz1etXowEwOb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chameleon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
