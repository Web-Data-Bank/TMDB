Central are three pedophile men. One of them was a board member in youth and youth work for many years and thus came into contact with boys. Another portrays boys in Norway and the Netherlands and has a lot of success with his work. The fact that pedophilia is often misunderstood and tolerated less is shown by the story of the man who, after he told his environment of his or her nature, is absolutely no longer accepted. Actual sexual contact remains a rarity, but a visit to a performance of the Noord-Hollands Jongenskoor offers all three possibilities for the development of their feelings.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":73348,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lagestee Film BV","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1993-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Bach Virus","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
