The sun shone on this rot,\r As in order to cooked to perfection,\r And to give back to great Nature a hundredfold\r Everything she had joined together ...  - And yet you will be like this garbage,\r To this horrible infection,\r Star of my eyes, sun of my nature,\r You, my angel and my passion!  Yes ! such you will be, O queen of graces,\r After the last rites,\r When you go, under the grass and the lush flowers,\r Mold among the bones.  Amors, oh my beauty! tell the vermin\r Who will eat you with kisses,\r That I kept the divine form and essence\r Of my decomposed loves!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wOoCaJSb0RcjCIOjCimyk6vhzIH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le tombeau d'Aphrodite - Version 2","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
