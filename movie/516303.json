A thorough interpretation of the period as a reference note to world-famous French philosopher and sociologist Jean Baudrillard’s notion of ‘simulation’. The film’s title is an ironic extension of Sigmund Freud’s famous quote, \"America is a mistake, admittedly a gigantic mistake\", which implies the Austrian scientist’s disappointment from empty American life in which money is the utmost value.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","name":"Bulgaria"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"BULGARIA IS A BIG MISTAKE TOO","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
