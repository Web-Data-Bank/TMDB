A much-needed portrayal of biracial trans and gender-nonconforming lives in America, this documentary chronicles the transition of Zo Thorpe and the sympathetic response of his family. But CHANGE IN THE FAMILY is about so much more than the transition experience; it speaks to the complexity of young adulthood, being a person of color, having a biracial identity, and coming out as trans and gender-nonconforming. Zoâ€™s story provides hope for a time when portraying this type of experience is no longer so unusual.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/8KOKrisRxYBkzS906akA7yuYm6k.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Change in the Family","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
