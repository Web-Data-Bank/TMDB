Focus is on the three kids thrown into extraordinary circumstances, which brings out best and worst in their relationship to themselves, each other, death and having to be/become an adult. Mum's corpse only appears briefly in the first episode, and the morbid aspects of the story are undertoned in relationship to the subtle humor.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hUJaSPnsLLJsxZq2m6IGVlphXjb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2012-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The secret","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
