At least the unemployed Maria Kowalke thinks after her break-up and when the \"strange\" father re-enters her life. Instead of teaching art education, Maria, who urgently needs work, has to step in as a music teacher in a secondary school. The lack of concentration and insubordination of their 10th graders quickly push them to their limits. It could always be worse! But Maria Kowalke is a teacher who advocates for her students, and her father Max Schellinger a pensioner who is far from the old iron.","popularity":0.668,"poster_path":"/hJyfQhTcFKdP566zuhwkBEckiBv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":40788,"logo_path":"/ydsYNksXNi0NzkCDSjnpsPRUCGI.png","name":"Wiedemann \u0026 Berg Television","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2018-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wir lieben das Leben","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":2}
