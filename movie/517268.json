His one-man show asks of the texts, “Who is transgressing and transcending gender?” with creativity, humor, and thought-provoking results. Director Samuel Neff bolsters Toscano’s performance with footage of the actor’s own lectures reflecting on his work, producing a film accessible to audiences both familiar and unfamiliar with the Bible.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dc6ujGNlfXypi0cYwh8s27RjZ24.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Transfigurations: Transgressing Gender in the Bible","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
