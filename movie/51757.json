Volume three is mostly comprised of live material, with five full-length concerts included. One of these shows is a real treat for collectors, as it dates back to 1973, and is the first time the band was ever captured playing in full make-up. Also featured is an appearance on MTV's popular UNPLUGGED show from 1995, which saw the original line-up of the band performing together for the first time since 1979. With a total run time approaching 10 hours, this collection should keep Kiss fanatics more than happy until the next volume in the series arrives.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mx43l2FfDYQMCV0JLcFyS4ErG8e.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-12-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kissology: The Ultimate KISS Collection Vol. 3 (1992-2000)","video":true,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":2}
