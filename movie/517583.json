Frazer and Svetlana provide in The Temporal World a most unusual and unique short film. It’s about a chance encounter-two total strangers meet and make love in a contruction site, only to find out later that it was all part of an arrangement by somebody else. The Hitchhiker: A hitchhiker finds sexual heat in the back of a van. This is another imaginative short film. Eric Edwards plays the surprised hitchhiker – and surprised he is. The man who gives him a ride has his wife and daughter from a previous marriage getting it on in the back. The man encourages the hitchhiker not only to watch, but to participate. It’s every hitchhiker’s dream come true!","popularity":1.177,"poster_path":"/mRoaZW0lWPlLuDpzzlTkynAySg8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1985-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jubilee of Eroticism","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
