The libretto is comprised of passages from “The Bhagavad-Gita,” India’s greatest philosophical epic, and perfectly complements Glass’ ravishing score, mysteriously transporting the audience with a serene power and an all-encompassing sense of peace.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lrZd6EowdUwxOzWHnTQmo7o4lhp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38242,"logo_path":null,"name":"RM Arts","origin_country":""},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":168,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Sanskrit","iso_639_1":"sa","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Philip Glass: Satyagraha","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
