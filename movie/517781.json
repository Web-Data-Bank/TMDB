During their forest experiment Alex, the director, is haunted by disturbing dreams where Artaud appears and mocks his ambitions. When these strange nightmares persist, Alex stops sleeping in an attempt to regain control over his mind. Sleep-deprived and with his sanity pushed to its limits, he seeks help from a Psychotherapist who suggests hypnosis as a means to uncover the source of his problems. What follows is a psychic journey through the internal landscape of Alex's subconscious memories and dreams, a sojourn that leads us to a place beyond belief, beyond words, and beyond the mind itself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8cnsPYArqYjL9B7mATzIVI9z0lZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Invisible Forest","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
