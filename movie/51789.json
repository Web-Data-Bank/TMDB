It is one of his more suggestive and emotive works. It beat all the records of sale of the Spanish market on having reached the 1,000,000 copies in the first week.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jBSqK3ItHzHaxgTDy9WINQ2x10.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12700,"logo_path":"/4Bw5eCs1SdRXDmTI84kfuqk6Gqm.png","name":"Warner Music Group","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"El Alma Al Aire","title":"Alejandro Sanz: El Alma Al Aire - Live - Vicente Calderón Stadium - June 28th 2001","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
