Through their voices we'll present their points of view on Gabriela Blas, a local pastor imprisoned for the lost of her three years old son, while looking after her Llama herd. Days go by as we listen to their reflections on motherhood, life and death, in this abandoned land, were grazing Llamas and Alpacas is the sole breadwinner in a world in retreat, abandoned on the Andes mountains.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ck5Xt3s4oYJ7qx2PLLSSCXjZZRv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103299,"logo_path":null,"name":"Precario Cine","origin_country":""},{"id":103300,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tetrapodo","origin_country":""},{"id":82537,"logo_path":null,"name":"Maltrato Films","origin_country":"CL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"},{"iso_3166_1":"PE","name":"Peru"}],"release_date":"2016-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Andean Sheperdess","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
