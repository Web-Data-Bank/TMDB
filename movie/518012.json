Even though the cycle is coming to its end, they inhabitants refuse to leave their land. The landscape of San Rosendo: the mountains, the river, the trees, the roads, the houses and the railway ruins, retains traces of the past and the history of those men. The Noise of Trains portrays a several villagers, mostly old people, that carry out small actions during a day. These characters are defined from their gestures, movements and looks. They are closely related with the place they live in and they are another element of the landscape. This is a film about spaces, atmospheres and distances, where the framings talk about the mood of a place that is disappearing slowly. It has no interviews or voices in off, but the ambient sounds transmit the sensations of loneliness and abandonment that surround to the characters.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eDw887saqQI9O538ASjkAdqtqh1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2015-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Noise of Trains","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
