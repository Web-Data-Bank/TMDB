The film of the image was shot before the film of the voice. The film of the image is the reproduction of 160 photographs (of films, advertisements, news ...) filmed in variable durations (more and more slowly, then more and more quickly). What do we see? Looks. Hand gestures. The film of the voice is not a comment. Neither a voice-over: in no way does this voice have such a status and even less the character of an exhibit for a better understanding of the film. On the contrary, she perverts, disturbs, worries.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/m1rXvgWQYvexBBKR8eFOy64szW8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103303,"logo_path":null,"name":"Groupement de Recherches et d’Essais Cinématographiques","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1979-08-21","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Un sanglant symbole","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
