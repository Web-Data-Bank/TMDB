However, while watching the news, Sylvia will learn about Kasia's gruesome death, so without hesitation, she will decide to leave the convent to settle things once and for all with the monstrous Fantom Whipper. But unbeknownst to Sylvia, the Fantom Whipper is also looking for her to claim what used to be his, intending to exact his typical kind of inhumane discipline to all those who foolishly stand in his way. As a result, Sylvia, armed with a big gun and an even bigger desire for revenge, will soon discover the Whipper's house, unaware that, inevitably, she will get a deserving strict punishment for her rebellion, sadly, in more ways than she could ever have expected or hoped.","popularity":0.7,"poster_path":"/7WSOwNVIe6lfRm5awVRjZwdCayG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mark of the Whip 2","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":2}
