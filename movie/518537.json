The cameras captured this moment by scandalizing public opinion. This kick allowed Ossamah, famous soccer coach in his country, to arrive in Madrid and resume his profession. But the rest of his family did not have the same luck. The story of Ossamah allows us to reflect on the survival of thousands of Syrian families trapped in Turkey but also that of Moatassam, Youssef and Muhannad, three promising Syrian footballers who were robbed of the best years of their lives by war.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6CHItv163ZUAtoKDA9OW7FqqKee.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":54706,"logo_path":null,"name":"Boogaloo Films","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":5085,"logo_path":"/mPuVc7m1Ki7OQQvAYwYfIlEI3vu.png","name":"TV3","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":7847,"logo_path":null,"name":"Escándalo Films","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":130159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films d'Ici Méditerranée","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":76921,"logo_path":"/dkPpGhEL2uQ5bmNDAqSZRFp894g.png","name":"Les Films d'ici","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"2017-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hayati: My Life","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
