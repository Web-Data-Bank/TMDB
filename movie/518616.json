Based on Gary Null’s ground breaking book on the hundreds of thousands of injuries and deaths caused by conventional medicine, the documentary looks at the medical industrial complex, the pharmaceutical industry’s usurpation of the nation’s medical schools, research, falsified drug clinical trials, peer reviewed scientific journals, and the complicity of federal health agencies to permit this to happen. The result is a medical system unfounded on sound science. Why is there a lack of oversight by government regulatory agencies and private interest lobbyists call the shots for national healthcare? The result is the American medical system is broken and corrupted by money rather than scientific fact, and the answer is to create a new medical paradigm that addresses the health of people rather than raising of stock prices, careers and reputations.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eofZkrtx3fZ0xtyQDkC3dQ5rGWq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Death by Medicine","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
