Filmmaker Evan Neel captures the events of that time along with the spirit that ties Detroit to its sports. A perfect companion piece to 2018's opening night film The Russian Five, The Joe serves as a fitting elegy for a building that housed the hopes, dreams and victories of Detroiters for three decades, and that now bows into the feted halls of sports history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wJ7c5Rt6XoXOPy5XQuUs2SvDytT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Joe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
