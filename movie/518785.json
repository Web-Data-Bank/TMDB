Unable to cope, her uncommunicative son chooses to tune out of his parent’s arguments. Ki feebly refuses divorce to keep the family intact, but her husband is already eagerly anticipating a new marriage with a baby coming on the way.  Ki has her searing anger building up behind the façade of normalcy. On the verge of a breakdown with pleading fallen on deaf ears, she takes matters into her own hands.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Silence","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
