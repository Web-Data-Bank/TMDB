It's going to be the first celebration since the latest war. Amal, Fuad, their brothers and cousins have lost their parents, their houses and their olive trees. The neighborhood where they live is being rebuilt. As they replant trees and plow fields, they face their most difficult task: piecing together their own memory. Through these young survivors' recollections, Samouni Road conveys a deep, multifaceted portrait of a family before, during and after the tragic event that changed its life forever.","popularity":1.045,"poster_path":"/AelOUJJzX2Ut3Ye5wTMxm1yhRmM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111953,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dugong Production","origin_country":""},{"id":102928,"logo_path":null,"name":"Picofilms","origin_country":""},{"id":30056,"logo_path":"/pCcVg35wQOaAdClPp10IdVSvys4.png","name":"Alter Ego Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2018-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":129,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Samouni Road","video":false,"vote_average":6.846,"vote_count":13}
