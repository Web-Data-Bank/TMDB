HALF MAN, HALF GHOST is the latest exploration by Davi Pretto after his first feature-film CASTANHA. Pretto shows us an old man’s slow disappearing process, in a far and remote area in the south of Brazil. A man that represents an old style of men that inhabited this region, but no longer exists. Somewhere between an ethnographic documentary and a fantasy, a journey into darkness and oblivion.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xh36atvWZsftnVkzFYFPUgWdoMq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53286,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tokyo Filmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2015-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Half Man, Half Ghost","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
