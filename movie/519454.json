The main character is torn apart by internal contradictions, leading him to the path of Evil. Bans on self-identification - philosophical, existential, sexual, and then permissiveness spawn a monster that is not aware of its true nature and genuine desires. Throughout the film-trilogy, the protagonist goes through a series of temptations that ruin his soul and lead, after all, to a madhouse. In a general sense, the film allegorically shows the tragic path of the Russian lumpen intellectual, lost between the past and the present, not finding the strength to accept and comprehend the unexpected changes that happened in our country twenty years ago. In the global sense - the tragic circle of Russian history.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/rA5kzzEK3lygsb7GYCx0IWsmo3p.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1991-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Bigmoon Nights","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3}
