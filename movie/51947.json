Irish-American medical student Kerry O'Shea hopes to stay aloof, but saving a wounded friend gets him outlawed, and inexorably drawn into the rebel organization...under his former professor Sean Lenihan, who has \"shaken hands with the devil\" and begun to think of fighting as an end in itself. Complications arise when Kerry falls for a beautiful English hostage, and the British offer a peace treaty that is not enough to satisfy Lenihan.","popularity":1.939,"poster_path":"/2jN4KfZK0XX8q58PeRp4XQP4Cv4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31267,"logo_path":null,"name":"Troy Films","origin_country":""},{"id":10568,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pennebaker Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1959-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A story of love and hate...and the sudden sound of guns!","title":"Shake Hands with the Devil","video":false,"vote_average":6.722,"vote_count":18}
