Now a teenager, Kevin suffers from a form of autism so severe that the majority of so-called specialised institutions have long refused to take him in. Clémence Hébert followed him with her camera, from one place to another. She, who is gifted with speech and he, who lives without, tamed each other as peers with a lens as the only medium of recognition, which captures what palpitates, appears, withers, and recommences. A discontinued but living link.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lny3Gi0RiaKFkoagR6Pb2OXGb1g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":67421,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dérives Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":80154,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films d'Ici 2","origin_country":""},{"id":74735,"logo_path":null,"name":"CBA","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":792,"logo_path":"/cRhBQP1FFNugNxKkO1pUgeD2Rkr.png","name":"RTBF","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kev","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
