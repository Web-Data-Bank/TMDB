Given its geographical situation, it is a place that opens wide the doors of imagination. A Girl from Ouessant is an invented and, at the same time very documented, cartography of the island. This methodical statement starts as the diary of Éléonore Saintagnan, the resident artist-filmmaker at the Créac’h semaphore station, an ideal site for observing the surrounding area. Then, the account shifts towards a playful mise en scène, peopled with sailors’ wives, kelp burners, stories of little black sheep or countless shipwrecks… Drawing on the regional archives filmed in black and white dating from a time when the island lived mainly from fishing, the game begins.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ps3ov6Jt5gdvJF6QIG4JV8bnUd9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":87031,"logo_path":"/lXqLNf7ttr1AIchNgDh27ueMsPf.png","name":"Michigan Films","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Girl from Ouessant","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
