Originally from High Wycombe, they set about tearing up the local scene before before spreading their disease across the UK, Europe, and beyond.  Three parts loose 'n loud garage rock, one part grungedelic progpunk, Thee Hypnotics produced the kind of uplifting vibe that most of the big-league rock 'n rollers had lost years ago, and most of the newer bar-room gutter rock and tripped-out psyche revivalists could only dream of.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/cKeAEfOlNqmN3xyCjO1eQSrmWLO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103652,"logo_path":null,"name":"Phil Smith Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A sleasy, swaggering, soulful, absurdly and gloriously self-conscious trash blues thing, all sullen struck poses and tough attitude.","title":"Thee Hypnotics - Soul Trading","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
