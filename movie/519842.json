She's wild, irreverent, and horny -- a natural for the United States Army. Once enlisted, Puss does her best to get out. The military life is just not for her. She meets Jack, the local stud, but her bang-up job falls short. Puss tries other stunts in order to shorten her too-long tour. She fakes insanity, joins a weird religious cult, gambles, and carries on, but whatever she does backfires. Looks like she's doomed to a career in the military. Yes, Puss is in action, mobilized, and ready -- the bawdiest hi-jinks this side of Fort Dix.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/v78zrCdTOz9zpOfpJC9Dism8BrU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":68785,"logo_path":null,"name":"Video X Pix","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1982-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"READY, WILLING and ABLE to serve...
