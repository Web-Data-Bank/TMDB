It's about family and the memories we leave behind, a story that began 80 years ago in 1937, when eight-year-old Xia Shuqin witnessed the murder of her family in the horror known as the Nanjing Massacre. In just six weeks, 300,000 people were slaughtered at the hands of Japanese soldiers - victims of mass rape and murder. Xia Shuqin and her 4-year-old sister hid from the soldiers for ten long days, concealing themselves under the corpses of their parents and siblings. Madame Xia, now 88, shares her legacy of loss and survival.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ohIEgWu0f7chTfDBKfVJhsKatSH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94793,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cause \u0026 Affect Media","origin_country":""},{"id":80563,"logo_path":null,"name":"USC Shoah Foundation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Girl and The Picture","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
