He starts to struggle though, hitting a creative block, and he seeks ways to push through it. Looking for inspiration around him, he presses forward with his work, but the harsh, punctuating sound of a leaking sprinkler behind him leads to a terrifying realisation. - What he types seems to actually happen, and, unable to stop his hands, he starts to dread whether he is a creator, willing other worlds into being, or a character with no real choice at all.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1myFt3VFG6HAoT7f98XsHv17hi8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Am God and Severely Underqualified","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
