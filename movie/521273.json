Spanning several decades, Christina D. King and Elizabeth A. Castle's documentary charts Thunder Hawk's lifelong commitment, from her early involvement in the American Indian Movement (AIM), to her pivotal role in the founding of Women of All Red Nations, to her heartening presence at Standing Rock alongside thousands protesting the Dakota Access Pipeline. She passed her dedication and hunger for change to her daughter Marcy, even if that often meant feeling like comrades-in-arms more than mother and child. Through rare archival material—including amazing footage of AIM's occupation of Wounded Knee—and an Indigenous style of circular storytelling, Warrior Women rekindles the memories and legacy of the Red Power movement's matriarchs.","popularity":1.466,"poster_path":"/vRMo1nGxLR1zqmZP7MGWoK9YnTL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10943,"logo_path":"/9jd9RFYraPpPCz7rpqp5KhrwfAH.png","name":"ITVS","origin_country":"US"},{"id":24488,"logo_path":"/qR7gDm9nMYdrqnVpksmNMhwI1ZI.png","name":"Women Make Movies","origin_country":"US"},{"id":93092,"logo_path":"/6bzhNe066LzwT14dvYmtKNHUK8F.png","name":"Sundance Institute","origin_country":"US"},{"id":75170,"logo_path":"/AiDruPS1BWcXNke9nuS4qxq9vHh.png","name":"Chicken \u0026 Egg Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":72654,"logo_path":"/qAGfpZE53RKgPWyiWYnIUdzpPrb.png","name":"Lardux films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Warrior Women","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
