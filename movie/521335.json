Worse still, Handel has lost his inspiration to compose. But when he overhears the singing of famous actress Susannah Cibber, Handel is moved to once again write some of the greatest music ever heard. King George II tasks him to create an oratorio to celebrate the new Irish Viceroy in chaotic Dublin.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":33616,"logo_path":"/sXCFMaQ9pE44wv3cxhGAejIsmga.png","name":"Sprout Pictures","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":163,"logo_path":null,"name":"Revolution Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Hallelujah!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
