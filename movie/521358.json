They were only trying to help when they answered the desperate calls of a stranger in need, but by the time they realized the trap had been set it was already too late. As the night goes on, the blood begins to flow, and a murderous ghost rises from the grave to deal out death to any living soul who dares to turn their heads and face that darkness that lurks in the shadows.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gQExDSHWmvYpAOhQYFUjh7FsQso.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103951,"logo_path":null,"name":"Central Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don't Turn Around","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
