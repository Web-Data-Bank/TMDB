As the story opens, the very name \"Angus Valley Farms\" has become synonymous with carnage and horror - something of a contemporary urban legend. A group of student filmmakers travel to the site to shoot locations and reenactments for a documentary of the events. In the process, these innocents unleash an eviscerating horror that transcends their most depraved nightmares. Jeremy Isbell directs from his own original script; the film stars Isbell, Zuriel Noveskey, Tosha Jennings, Sara Shoulders, Travis Azbill and Nicole Bassinger.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/l0VErjvffWiMNoBspDkCFbVrtcd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103951,"logo_path":null,"name":"Central Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Angus Valley Farms","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
