Scotch spies a creepy yet interesting character stealing luggage, who then offers Scotch a ride into town if he will assist in dropping dirt and a frog-shaped flower pot into another man's car. Scotch, who is clearly several cards short of a full deck, complies and immediately earns the wrath of the car owner McDunley, a bearish sourpuss who runs the local video store and who has a mysterious long-running feud with Anderson, the luggage-thief who quickly becomes Scotch's new best friend.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zvpFf1s9oNU7Oey8aAfKeTYJhbI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25683,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hale Manor Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Living, loving, and stealing luggage.","title":"Everything Moves Alone","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
