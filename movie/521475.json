Everyone seems to fit into this perfect puzzle except the main character, G-O, a man who does not match the rest of his world. G-O finally finds his perfect match – another man – but the City Authority try to stop this uncommon union. It is up to G-O and Ico to show their city that every connection is after all part of the same energy - love.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4UvqIRE26cST2ZAJ4xDoPTVIpKU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2014-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Plugin","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
