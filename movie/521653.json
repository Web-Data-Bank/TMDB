Two twin brothers are walking down the road carrying a pail of water, they fight and come to blows, and a bemused older man intervenes and sets them back on their way. It's that simple and it's that lovely.  A graduate of the Art School of Kyrghyzstan, Aktan Abdykalyko (or Abdikalikov) first worked as a set designer for Kirgisfilm. After several well-received documentaries and short films, his first feature-length fiction film, Beshkempir, won several awards including the Silver Leopard at the Locarno Film Festival.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uIPfLlCSkCL3UUM1IY3eiTDaMlI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KG","name":"Kyrgyz Republic"}],"release_date":"1997-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hassan Hussen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
