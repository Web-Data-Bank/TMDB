Rankin (not Rankins) shoots Tug, who is unaware of Rankin's lawless activities, in an argument and Jim is accused of murder and also stampeding the sheep. Believing Jim is guilty, Tug's daughter, Ruth, aids Buck in capturing Jim, but he escapes. Ruth gets help from Sheriff Hank Bosley, and a sheepherder, Sanchez, reveals Rankin's responsibility for both the rustling of Bledsoe's cattle and the killing of Wilson.","popularity":0.621,"poster_path":"/33wp35OP2nddSuITblZ0wb36RS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17986,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tiffany Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1930-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Latest of Bob's Wows!","title":"Near the Rainbow's End","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
