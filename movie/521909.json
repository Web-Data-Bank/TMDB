Here, though, the studio is not simply the location of the artwork’s genesis; the artist uses the artwork itself to dissect the space—and ultimately destroy the site—of its own production. In the video, Larson uses a turntable apparatus to inscribe circles onto paper, eventually perforating it. He continues the action until he breaks through the floor, creating a disorienting passage into unexpected new spaces.  — Whitney Museum 2014","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heavy Rotation","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
