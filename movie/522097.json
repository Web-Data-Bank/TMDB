His mind is set on nothing but nonsense and practical jokes. Nothing is more fun than to fool the clumsy bear or farmer Alfred’s mean watchdogs.  Only once Wabuu goes too far and Wuschel, the small squirrel is missing. Of course Wabuu has not intended that, but this time the other animals are real angry. Wabuu is terribly sorry. He starts looking for his friend Wuschel.
