Embracing low budget Hi 8 video to conduct informal street interviews and investigate the origin of the name of Blissville, and the character(s) of the town, the video takes the experimental form of a docu/poem. Not in the traditional sense with words but as a lyrical visual odyssey.  The video is not so much a mourning of things past, nor a nostalgia, although both these elements are present. It is more about the quest for, and resilience of community.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blissville…An Investigation","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
