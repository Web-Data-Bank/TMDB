He had it all - until a 2008 injury forever altered the course of his career. Late Life: The Chien-Ming Wang Story - named after the late sinking action on his signature pitch - follows the rise and fall of the international icon as he fights his way back into the Major Leagues through endless rehab programs and lengthy stints away from home, carrying the weight of the world on his battered shoulder. A poignant and intimate account of Wang’s steadfast quest, Late Life tells the story of a man who is unwilling to give up and unable to let go.","popularity":2.656,"poster_path":"/nGlgzkO3WNjkCfVoLBg82BYa7HS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":104197,"logo_path":"/mCy3rCmOQMk3GUTY0zEgel4VXfa.png","name":"WYC Motions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":104199,"logo_path":null,"name":"EBOS International","origin_country":""},{"id":15544,"logo_path":null,"name":"408 Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":107179,"logo_path":"/6nl5OkcInmcrvQ5F2rpmT2r3YD0.png","name":"Activator Marketing Company","origin_country":"TW"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Late Life: The Chien-Ming Wang Story","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":5}
