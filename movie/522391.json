When the danchi is scheduled for demolition, Shizu and neighbors must say goodbye to their homes, and move into newer danchi that are too small to hold all of Shizu's mementos. This intimate documentary captures Shizu's sense of humor, and profound nostalgia, as she sorts through relics of her past, and chooses which memories she must fit into her new home, and which ones she can let go of.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/do0fECRaGi7R5MS1vUzLGy2Bzkr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108886,"logo_path":null,"name":"Impleo","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":79847,"logo_path":null,"name":"Assemblage","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2018-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Danchi Woman","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
