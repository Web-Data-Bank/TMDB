The body of work in this exhibition took its starting point from Feyrer and Henderson's collaborative 16mm film Bottles Under the Influence (2012), made with bottles from the collection of the Historical Museum of Wine & Spirits in Stockholm. The bottles are documented, staged, positioned, studied, projected on, tucked in bed, drunk from, and shot at. Like bodies made of glass, they appear headless, armless, and footless, with lips and necks. These vessels hold the contents of the film.  Bottles Under the Influence is an exhibition of interconnected film sets: a pest detective's office, a dream-world press bar, a sleep-inducing herb garden, and a cinema. A 16mm film of the same name as the exhibition plays in the cinema, shot and researched by the artists at the Historical Wine and Spirits Museum in Stockholm.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bottles Under the Influence","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
