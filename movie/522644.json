The bitter irony is obvious here -- Allison is at the peak of his powers, and yet at the same time, it could be said that he's playing like a man with only weeks to live. Performers include: Luther Allison: lead guitar, vocals; James Solberg: rhythm & lead guitar; Mike Vlahakis: keyboards; Ken Faltinson: bass; Robb Stupka: drums; and Memphis Horns (Wayne Jackson, Andrew Love).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Luther Allison: Songs from the Road","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
