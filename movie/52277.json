She moves in with an aunt and socialist uncle: finding a new husband is high on her agenda, and she's mistrusted by Agga, a pre-teen who's our eyes and ears. The social order and Freyja are more complicated than they seem at first, and so may be her prospects. Class divisions, families ties, pride, the onset of puberty, and the power of Eros sliver the ice.","popularity":0.798,"poster_path":"/yjwf3Do2T700dFa3tBUarpU9Max.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14935,"logo_path":null,"name":"IsFilm","origin_country":"IS"},{"id":1471,"logo_path":null,"name":"Archer Street Productions","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":14998,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hope \u0026 Glory Film Productions GmbH","origin_country":""},{"id":14999,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hope \u0026 Glory Pictures International","origin_country":""},{"id":15000,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hope \u0026 Glory Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"2001-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sometimes it's not about whodunit... but why","title":"The Seagull's Laughter","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":13}
