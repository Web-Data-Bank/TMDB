Using a quirky Wes Anderson–inspired aesthetic, Snowbirds examines their hibernation destination: the French-speaking community of Hallandale Beach in Florida. There we meet characters like Agathe, affectionately nicknamed \"Aunty\" by the other seniors, an 88-year-old Quebecoise who eats chocolate bars and drinks Pepsi for lunch. Her secret to a pill-free old age? A fanatical worship of the sun. Many others come for the same reason, and together their days at this campground community are dictated by English conversation classes, jaunts to the beach and afternoon lawn bowling. With lots of tenderness and good humour, the film considers the joys and woes of aging, the importance of community and American-Canadian cultural differences.","popularity":1.099,"poster_path":"/zXOODpuPIbVHTSMV7HI6Uf6o7qk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38201,"logo_path":"/fYolDp6ajIDXiMsXYXHXcWyNIYe.png","name":"Colonelle Films","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2018-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Snowbirds","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
