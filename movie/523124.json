As a defender of his people's culture and traditions, he was known as \"Spudwrench\" during the 1990 Oka crisis. Offering a unique look behind the barricades at one man's impassioned defence of sacred territory, the film is both a portrait of Horne and the generations of daring Mohawk construction workers that have preceded him.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u3QhO6dB1ixOmOsaX0chG8kuJHH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spudwrench","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
