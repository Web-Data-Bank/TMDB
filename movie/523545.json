The film is a contemplation without any people or moving machines in it, focussing on the built and designed. The narration is fragmentary and works with calm frontal, raw tracking shots. The film is also a narrative of “city-becoming”.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jxJw2bo8Cnn4TTU7RnKdPvqvC6z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2017-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Transitions","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
