The film takes place both ashore and at sea, and sketches an image of the fishing district through a poetic glance at Marnix’ life. The East Shore in Ostend is the neighbourhood in which fishermen dwell: they weave nets, play cards and kill time. Now, this district is being demolished: high, white residential blocks are rising up instead. East Shore, the film, reflects this fragmented composition in its form: ashore, Marnix’ life is enacted in scenes impersonated by him and his fellows; at sea we look more indirectly, through shadows, silhouettes and reflections, at how life goes on.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oosteroever","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
