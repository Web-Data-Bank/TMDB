It records the sounds and movements of a “sonic digger,” whose bucket has been replaced by a large cast-iron bell that destroys the interior of the building. The modified machine is thus transformed into a “counter-memorial” instrument that marks the occasion of the closure of this significant workplace, a site associated with progress and health. Through music, it excavates the historical connection between medicine, sickness and cure, and the neocolonial framework of US-Puerto Rico relations embedded in the very fabric of the building.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ycwGNUgnaB4jlr3EFK3VjDpQES7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Bell, the Digger, and the Tropical Pharmacy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
