A debate, that mirrors the moralism and bigottery of a generation that seems to think, that the world is a moral playground.” Emil Nolde’s relationship to the Nazi-regime in the Third Reich has given rise to immense discussions within the last months. For decades the broader public had a picture of Nolde being one of the “entartete” artists as well as being prohibited painting by the Nazi-regime. Though this on the surface is true, it was the result of a great disappointment to Nolde. For years, he had strived to become “the” artist of the Thrid Reich, praising his own art as true, German, anti-French and anti-Jewish. Possible competitors within the German art world like Max Pechstein he actively denounced to the Nazi authorities.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/t2FBGZWZgUEVPNkqi0rLYOGMKhV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52811,"logo_path":null,"name":"Louisiana Channel","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2014-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Daniel Richter on Emil Nolde","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
