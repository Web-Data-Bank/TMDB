Kendall Elizabeth Katrine (Jordan-Paige Sudduth) has gone through a lot of her life with her best friend, Zander Cordova (Cobin Bugni), by her side. He’s stuck by her through thick and thin. Whether she's at school or in the hospital, he's there. But when Zander starts to go off the wrong path, Kendall is ready to jump in and save him, just as he’s done for her, but someone else beats her to it.
