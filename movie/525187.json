Founded in San Francisco by renown activist, drag queen and performer Jose Sarria, the Council has helped shaped LGBT life and social history in San Francisco and beyond throughout the last five decades. Sarria was also the first openly gay man to run for political office in the United States in 1961.  From its genesis as a critical public space for the community and capacity building of LGBT San Franciscans, to its vital role in the advocacy for LGBT human rights, 50 YEARS OF FABULOUS documents the full scope of the organizationâ€™s historical evolution up to its contemporary struggle in finding relevance -- both in the wake of social progress it has helped foster, and in light of a newly empowered political coalition committed to rolling back a half-century of civil rights achievements.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/s19OZZVebtmzGAMEUvA5D93eaJg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-05-17","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"50 Years of Fabulous","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
