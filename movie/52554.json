Eighteen songs, performed in December 2009 at the Hammersmith Apollo, with an absolute minimum of onstage chatter and dollops of stylishly grainy, MTV-like filler: Ms. Spektor on the plane from New York, driving through London, applying makeup before the show. It’s perfectly tasteful, a fine showcase for her music and, more important, a fine promotional tool for the accompanying CD and DVD (which — surprise — contain four additional songs).","popularity":1.583,"poster_path":"/aHUr6IWmalVNr8tAYmCxOfHekim.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88121,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sire Records","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Regina Spektor: Live in London","video":true,"vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":4}
