The life story of Dragica Srzentić casts light on a number of events and people relevant to Yugoslav history before and after the Second World War. The film’s look at the century-long life of this woman-hero provides insight into the rarely mentioned segments of the ex-Yugoslav intellectual and ideological maze that traverses all the states in which this Istrian-born woman lived (Austria-Hungary, Kingdom of Italy, Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, NDH, FNRJ, SFRJ, Croatia, and Serbia).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rhbeFadza9PMao0zlt2MIG3Iasm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":93353,"logo_path":null,"name":"Playground Produkcija","origin_country":"RS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"}],"release_date":"2011-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":158,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Woman – One Century","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
