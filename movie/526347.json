Still, his (somehow) charismatic personality, witty lyrics, and infectious beats have made him a supremely popular hip hop star. E features several of the director's cut music videos for his hit songs, including \"The Way I Am,\" \"The Real Slim Shady,\" and \"My Name Is.\" In addition, the long form video of \"Stan,\" Eminem's creepy dramatization of an obsessive fan gone of the deep end, is also included.
