Responding superbly to the role, Swedish soprano Nina Stemme – she of the richly clear voice – offers an Aida vibrant with love and emotion.  Heading a magnificent cast, she makes a poignant couple with talented tenor Salvatore Licitra as Radamès. Luciana d’Intino is nothing less than brilliant in the role of Aida’s rival Amneris and Juan Pons imbues his Amonasro with enormous humanity.  Conducting the Zurich Opera orchestra and chorus, Adam Fischer brings out all the score’s musical and dramatic majesty.","popularity":1.095,"poster_path":"/gLfpI0X3Q3BHSEc4wKWREV5YtHO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":152,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aida","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
