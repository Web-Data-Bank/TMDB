Larry Richards, a black man running for the Senate, is one of Matt's best friends. Larry has become the target of The Pentangle, a racist organization led by a man named Glastenbury, and Glastenbury doesn't want Larry to be elected. In an attempt on Larry's life during a Mardi Gras parade in New Orleans, The Pentangle kills one of Larry's sons. Matt lets Larry, his wife Daisy, and his other son move to the remotely located farm so they can hide from Glastenbury and the Pentangle, but the Pentangle strikes again, setting the farmhouse on fire. Matt and Sara escape as the only survivors. Then the Pentangle kidnaps Sara, sending Matt on a mission to rescue Sara from Glastenbury and the Pentangle","popularity":5.796,"poster_path":"/nR2SSO740LzAAL43l8iDdik5flP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13549,"logo_path":null,"name":"Golan-Globus Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":1444,"logo_path":"/1848gsFuV3EGewKg8xWADAyJUVy.png","name":"Cannon Group","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1986-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Avenging Force","video":false,"vote_average":5.289,"vote_count":57}
