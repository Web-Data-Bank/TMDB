Tale-telling to some children is the realization of creative instincts, to others the performance of self, or it's simply a tedious pedagogic vessel. My research-creation completes with adult women transforming the usage of Cinderella-objects into agents of their own stories, however fragmentary or elliptical. The event of tale-telling woke up the child in them; children language was appropriated to perform unarticulated subjectivities. Gender is a complex system, most revealing in language-in-action. The coda is a grand finale celebrating the magical power of objects and their own unlimited lives. Story-telling is the most primitive form of play. Harmless it may look, it is also the most sophisticated embodiment of ideological workings.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fOxswxeaGkhpmfqbvw74kCmKEIP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Excitable Speech: All About Cinderella","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
