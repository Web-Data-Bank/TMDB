Instead he got cops, rabbis and missing money. But Neil and Nick’s beloved Australian – and Kiwi – band Crowded House has always been a little bit different. It seems like only yesterday they first sang their way into our heads and hearts, but in fact they’ve been writing and performing their hit songs for 30 years. So to celebrate the milestone, Neil and Nick took Charles on a nostalgic journey back to where it all started.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nDLs6bjTren3g6zi0drEAPPbYUe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78589,"logo_path":null,"name":"Channel Nine Entertainment Ltd.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2016-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A nostalgic journey back to where it all started","title":"House Proud","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
