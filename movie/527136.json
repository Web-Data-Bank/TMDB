The music video was inspired by the film \"Tudo Sobre Minha Mãe\" (1999), by Spanish filmmaker Pedro Almodóvar. It is different from the traditional format, as it presents a long narrative, in which the music appears more as a complement to the story told in the video. It was shot on 16mm cameras and became a short film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9C6yBO021E0LGOqLr6hSFH6LikT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92048,"logo_path":"/bEHvtPu7mCoSPbbvGC1czOcITqt.png","name":"Spray Filmes","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":127573,"logo_path":null,"name":"Casablanca Video","origin_country":""},{"id":9339,"logo_path":"/hwEpOrIYH7G4Rolt7s2thYquJnD.png","name":"Universal Music Group","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2006-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sandy & Junior: Estranho Jeito de Amar","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":3}
