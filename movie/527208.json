And who would say that these same kids literally from the other side of the world, influenced by those artists, were starting to create a strong and lively hip-hop culture in Porto, Portugal? In a journey that begins in the late 80s when the first echoes of American hip-hop began to shyly arrive in Portugal through television (MTV), movies (\"Style Wars\", \"Beat Street\") and radio, the documentary takes a deep look at the history and memories of Porto's rap culture until today.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vBY3ieE9FUiUW4a3s7uv0cdVr1t.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2017-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":155,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Não Consegues Criar O Mundo Duas Vezes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
