Philipp surprises Katrin with a marriage proposal. But the disappointment of her last marriage has not yet been overcome. And promptly, the events turn over. Julia, her ex-husband's new wife, moves in with her unasked and with children. Not only her pointed-tongued ex-mother-in-law Diana, but also Katrin's own mother Renate, come to help. When Philipp takes her by surprise with a spontaneous surprise wedding, Katrin bursts the collar. A marriage now seems a long way off.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/g94v31fQcxP9oFDL88DB32Uk104.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84794,"logo_path":"/1a4b2NW2rqBJQx5hcnxEOqvZXvp.png","name":"Ariane Krampe Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":1251,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2018-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trauung mit Hindernissen","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":4}
