This piece of art won worldwide fame as a Manifesto of Suprematism, one of the brightest areas of the Russian avant-garde. Black Square was painted in 1915 as scenery for opera performance. From that moment and for the next 100 years Suprematism defines a new language of art, in its various forms: non-figurative painting, modern architecture, industrial design, fashion, book graphics and scenography. The film is dedicated to the 100th anniversary of the Black Square, the main content of which is energy. A replica of this masterpiece of non-objectiveness is the energy of dance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2017-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black Square","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
