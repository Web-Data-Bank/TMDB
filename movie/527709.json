Nicholas is forever at odds with the city, its tourists, and the Thomas Jefferson impersonator who continually steals his reenactments no matter how historically inaccurate the circumstances. When Nicholas's affair with Isabelle is discovered, his job as Hamilton is compromised. An affair that bears an uncanny likeness to Alexander Hamilton's infamous Philadelphia sex scandal with Maria Reynolds.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/id2KveKCAgoc6sx47qnltJpwl75.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Man Full of Trouble","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
