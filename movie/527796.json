Simon Keenlyside’s riveting performance as the tortured Prince of Denmark in Patrice Caurier and Moshe Leiser’s starkly brooding production had critics raving that Keenlyside’s superb singing, coupled with his deftly delineated three-dimensional Hamlet, was one of the greatest examples of operatic drama of our time. The cast includes Marlis Petersen as the long suffering Ophélie, who brilliantly shows why her mad scene is so justly famous, along with Jennifer Larmore and James Morris as Gertrude and Claudius.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mL0TBeYvKNxnZnc3mL11m2N1GHJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":178,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thomas: Hamlet","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
