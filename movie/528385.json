So the material, while mostly generated as a diary, is heterogeneous enough to include just about any kind of footage. At one point, a baby cries inconsolably, in another, a boy in a baseball uniform is playing Bach while his mother sits next to him putting on mascara. The 18 minute video montage of impressions has a cumulative effect, accessed and read differently depending on the mental connections the viewer makes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pPPru5zVIMqYDzAini9tMZTfnSf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"54 Days this Winter 36 Days this Spring for 18 Minutes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
