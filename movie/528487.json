Harsh temperatures, volatile weather and nine-month winters mean the area is normally devoid of human life. But each summer, this frozen landscape flourishes under endless daylight, revealing a spectacular ecosystem. Join Darren Berrecloth, Carson Storch, Cam Zink and Tom Van Steenbergen as they embark on an expedition to the top of the world to explore this relatively unknown land. In doing so, they discover a changing environment steeped in history along with challenging terrain unlike anything anyoneâ€™s ridden to date.","popularity":0.711,"poster_path":"/hFBTyjrbdpPSJ1Try9stZE3Se14.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9286,"logo_path":"/pT1nP1IVtabim8LSXP5qNZk6pYY.png","name":"The Orchard","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"North of Nightfall","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":2}
