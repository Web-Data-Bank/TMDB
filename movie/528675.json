But they would not be deterred. For decades ten thousands of women in Germany, Great Britain, in France, the U.S. and many other countries fought for their right to vote. Some used the institutions, others turned into media savvy politicians, and still others turned to terrorism, went on hunger strike, or died as martyrs. 100 years later we tell a multi-perspective and emotional story of the international fight, against all odds, for women’s suffrage as an important step towards equal rights.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/fus4tRquYP8wod5y5ESuiurXEF6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8197,"logo_path":"/viR0A6jRF6fz6zcrET7nRAlHG49.png","name":"Gebrueder Beetz Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2018-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Are Half The World","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
