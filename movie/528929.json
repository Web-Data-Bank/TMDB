He was already the voice from the void; he was James the Boptist, a hard-partying rock ‘n’ roller that pioneered a new genre of Afrikaans rock music (despite being English) that sparked and fired a revolution. He was working with heavy-hitters William Kentridge and Warrick Sony on Faustus in Africa, staged in Grahamstown in 1995.  This is a rollicking musical ride through all these incarnations, with frank insights from 80’s and 90’s musicians and leftie luminaries – from Johannes Kerkorrel to Lloyd Ross, Pieter-Dirk Uys to Zapiro by way of the Radio Rats’ Jonathan Handley and Vusi Mahlasela.  It’s an intimate portrait of a wildly talented poet painted by those who knew him best.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/AjkwGs33GDMGjSXnJwoOT4EfYiY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Afrikaans","iso_639_1":"af","name":"Afrikaans"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fun's Not Over: The James Phillips Story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
