Tommy Hull wrote this song \"You\" and I shot this Super 8 Movie to go with his great melody. In this movie, you will see band members Chertow, Tommy Hull and George Reineke. You will also see my wonderful sister Dana Sachs and great friend Kathy Steuer. I too have a small cameo you might catch. Some of the film is shot in the Fairgrounds in Memphis and some in the now long gone but dearly cherished MUSEUM OF THE UNKNOWN in Marin County, California.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3XDyaSM4tUUNM7xZcDz49Myy2lu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Randy Band Film","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
