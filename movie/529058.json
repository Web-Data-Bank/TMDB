With her typical serious humor, Bromberg explores both the claims of science (we can improve human life) and the claims of religion (God made perfect beings) and implicitly asks the question, “How do we know when we’ve gone too far?’…There’s no voice-over and the argument is made by an athletic juxtaposition of imagery and testimony.” – Helen Knode, L.A.
