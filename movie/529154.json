For me, the combination of visual and aural abstraction is sublime, a means of forging pathways without a path, journeys devoid of compass bearings, invoking mysterious and unearthly transports. I am interested in making work that has no points of reference, where scale replaces structure and time is experienced rather than counted. Glide of Transparency is a film in three movements, an exploration of color and light. Ultimately, it is a film about love and transcendence.” (bb)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/AgzPQv353tWltdWL5UH3XngubNG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Glide of Transparency","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
