Sekss un Padomju Savienība","overview":"When Lyudmila Ivanova made her infamous claim during a US-Soviet TV programme in 1986 that ‘There is no sex in the USSR!’, her comment – although roundly mocked at the time – revealed a certain truth about Soviet attitudes towards sex and the ways in which it was controlled by the regime, rendering it largely invisible. With this documentary, the director takes us through 70 years of Soviet history to highlight the interplay between sex, politics and society and the changing meanings attached to sex and sexuality under different General Secretaries.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qm6Ktmr7THiKWtfMryalVDiAS7m.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":59209,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Studio Devini","origin_country":"LV"},{"id":20618,"logo_path":"/yGDXyW0kQUMpraYo3f1egJSkxh4.png","name":"Les Films du Balibari","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2017-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Double Life.
