In the film, the dogs are honest and loyal like Khun Thong Daeng.  The puppy Tonglor dreams of being a great bodyguard and protecting his boss like Khun Thong Daeng, so he always guards his owners — a blind girl and her grandma — very well.  Stray dog Jon is grateful to a monk who feeds him and looks after him. When a group of theives break into the temple, Jon risks his life to protect it.  Little Copper’s story was inspired by the story of Khun Thong Daeng, who was a street puppy adopted by His Majesty the King. Set in a futuristic world, Copper is a metal robot dog built by a girl called Sanim. Because he was built from trash, Copper doesn't operate properly and is a bit goofy. However, Sanim still finds him loveable.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/ej6kdgtrpB5UTQ0OVhN40ZmLl6O.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4207,"logo_path":"/v5BSFwIXQmZEO16bClILNrbv4Kl.png","name":"Sahamongkolfilm","origin_country":"TH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"2015-12-03","revenue":500000,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Inspirations","video":true,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
