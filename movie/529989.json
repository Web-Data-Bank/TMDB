Still, alternative versions reached other countries – including a different, early version in Italy – and pieces remain. Together with the rushes, outtakes and on location footage of Vigo during the shoot, Young Devils in School helps us to better understand Vigo’s original vision.","popularity":0.659,"poster_path":"/ysDr1PU2YwcjMJ3bRkvYZZA1c06.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9,"logo_path":"/nda3dTUYdDrJ6rZqBpYvY865aDv.png","name":"Gaumont","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Young Devils in School: Zéro de Conduite — Rushes, Sound, and Images","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
