Following short speeches by Schum and Jean Leering, the director of the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam, the artists' contributions are shown with no commentary. The eight artists from different countries (Richard Long, Barry Flanagan, Dennis Oppenheim, Marinus Boezem, Robert Smithson, Jan Dibbets, Walter de Maria, Mike Heizer) co-operated closely with Schum. The filming concentrates on the works of art that are created in rural sites, and there is none of the usual TV portrayal of the artist in a ‹studio atmosphere.› The elaborate productions were shot in Europe and the USA. Schum expanded the message of the emergent Land Art movement, which avoided the conventional ‹studio – gallery – collector› distribution channels.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1969-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Land art","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
