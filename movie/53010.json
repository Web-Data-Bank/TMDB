Though he's a brilliant couples counselor, he can't keep a woman in his life for more than two weeks. Indeed, ever since his childhood, Julien jinxes every woman who falls in love with him. But it's not just any small jinx. It's the kind that sends you to the hospital several times a week, that destroys your professional life or that turns your friends into enemies. Julien is strictly speaking a true black cat for women. Joanna Sorini will soon learn this at her expense the day she meets him. A career that's just taking off, a love life that finally seems to be taking a good turn, all that may just change.","popularity":6.966,"poster_path":"/19D673Z1ZlRUWsbqaHBtbzeaBI6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2927,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fidélité Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":11199,"logo_path":"/ursSXLOZaDxiZ84sEgfXbiFnYaa.png","name":"SCOPE Pictures","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":19491,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jerico","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":856,"logo_path":"/z0vTTWBhZggM09oZWSY3hbXgPKv.png","name":"Wild Bunch","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":819,"logo_path":"/cEqVIluQuO1ubtID8RvOem4ZiIg.png","name":"Mars Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":356,"logo_path":"/tSJvuFaLIp7l0ONLUiAHA61GbXu.png","name":"TF1 Films Production","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2011-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"This guy is a disaster or...","title":"Second Chance","video":false,"vote_average":5.734,"vote_count":237}
