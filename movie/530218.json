Paula and Emily are doing just that. Single hotel owner Paula Atkinson and her impulsive friend Emily van Garden have known each other since high school and have always been able to rely on each other. In a love crisis, Emily therefore moves into the \"Seaside Hotel\" and supports Paula. When Emily catches her fianc√© Frank with someone else a few days before the wedding and Paula realizes after an upsetting visit to the doctor that no one will be there for her nine-year-old daughter Lucy in an emergency, the two spontaneously order the posse in a two-girlfriends-against-the-rest-of-the-world moment.","popularity":0.659,"poster_path":"/et54adkUXciHS5Y4IP48mPgMmyN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2018-06-03","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Katie Fforde: Ziemlich beste Freundinnen","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":2}
