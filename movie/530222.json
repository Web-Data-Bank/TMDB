While they are looking for the simple, good life in the countryside, the locals are sceptical about the new neighbours. To bridge the gap and overcome stereotypes Lola sets up a project to bring the old garden back to life, growing and breeding their own food. More and more people from the city and the village join in and the project becomes a reflection on how we are living our lives today. How does the modern urban, individual define work and love? And how does this change our relationships?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qeue15AlQQODOGy4qJctfetnjl3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48663,"logo_path":"/6JAGPbWGuRWAREs0XKhyHa17EZD.png","name":"Detailfilm","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2018-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Bees and the Birds","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":6}
