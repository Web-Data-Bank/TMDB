But in seeing Afghanistan as a problem, the people of the country, and their desire for self-determination, are often overlooked.  From the Soviet invasion and the mujahideen resistance to the Taliban and the American occupation, A Darkness Visible: Afghanistan examines thirty years of Afghan history. It is the story of ordinary citizens whose lives play out in the shadow of superpowers. There are tales of violence to be sure, but there is also love and even romance.  Based on 14 trips to Afghanistan between 1994 and 2010, A Darkness Visible: Afghanistan is the work of renowned photojournalist Seamus Murphy. His work chronicles a people caught time and again in political turmoil, struggling to find their way.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/z0RnCoA0xTAYDvzpkJC9FbODrWq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Darkness Visable: Afghanistan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
