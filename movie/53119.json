The war deprived him of his family, and afterwards he endlessly turns over the soil of Antwerp to find the suitcases, which makes him look obsessed. He keeps checking old maps and keeps digging, trying to find, in fact, those he lost. His daughter Chaya is a beautiful modern girl looking for a part-time job. She finds a place as a nanny in the strictly observant Chassidic family with many children, although her secular manners clearly fly in the face of many commandments. One of the reasons she is accepted is that mother of the family is absolutely overburdened by the household, so she stays despite the resistance of the father, normally - an indisputable authority in the family. She develops a special bond with the youngest of the boys, four-year old Simcha, so far incapable of speaking.","popularity":1.835,"poster_path":"/8ZKh1Msebabhf48HGGt4rNPKXXo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7434,"logo_path":null,"name":"Favourite Films NV","origin_country":""},{"id":1259,"logo_path":"/6a5XUQ1c8h8dJragfFs1fpd7SqW.png","name":"Shooting Star Filmcompany","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"1998-03-30","revenue":100544,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"english_name":"Yiddish","iso_639_1":"yi","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Left Luggage","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":24}
