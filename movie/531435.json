In 1973 concerts, the band left the stage after Act Two and a filmed version of 'The Hare...' was shown.\r A spoken-word comedic interlude (narrated by Jeffrey Hammond with an exaggerated Lancashire accent) backed by instrumentation. Presented as an absurd fable, the interlude details (with much wordplay) the failure of a group of anthropomorphic animals to help a hare find his missing eyeglasses.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eTDRIEH5OUJYolrzYrssNqTaC1E.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1973-07-13","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jethro Tull: Story of the Hare who Lost his Spectacles","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
