Faced with racial discrimination, deficient community services, and poor education and job opportunities, Puerto Rican communities began to address these injustices by using direct action. This film focuses on the community of East Harlem, capturing the compassion and militancy of the Young Lords as they implemented their own health, educational, and public assistance programs and fought back against social injustice. An excellent portrayal of inner city organizing in the late 60s.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yQLgcGdcJaxp45IOOX2eIhhhkow.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El Pueblo Se Levanta (Newsreel #63)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
