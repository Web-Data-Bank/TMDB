Ambitious and slightly off-beat, 9191 mashes stop-motion animations with out-of-this-world footage and combines it with a haunting soundtrack by Baron, famed for his work on Flip's Extremely Sorry film. If you're looking for a snowboard flick with more meat than potatoes, you've got your hands full with 9191.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6CJHNLocEWfnjf6dY4kqlsgPLCn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"snowboarding","title":"Volcom 9191","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
