Alex stands to land the creative director position if she can photograph the pearl for the magazine’s 30th anniversary issue, and Colin hopes that by writing a guest article about the long-lost gem he can boost sales of his failing other books and not lose his publisher. As the two head off to their search, neither is aware yet that finding love could be the rarest adventure of all.","popularity":6.84,"poster_path":"/A19g63NzdhCrgk8s8Oa3SVhEQux.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13404,"logo_path":"/4F5RxvJgbVT0vFQHs3IYRPfJvo3.png","name":"Incendo Productions","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":96467,"logo_path":null,"name":"The MrG Production Company","origin_country":""},{"id":36152,"logo_path":"/gcpuz9w1jnAhvwkvFpNeYGOFQUc.png","name":"Cartel Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pearl in Paradise","video":false,"vote_average":5.94,"vote_count":50}
