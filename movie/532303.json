The view from the dock is, on one side, the Island of Vieques, and on the other; Vieques Sound--a passage that connects the Caribbean Sea with the Atlantic Ocean. The film is shot through a mirrored object, a formal experiment in order to transform and collapse the monumentality of the view, taking cues from shore fisherman who transform the base's use and meaning.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lTpcc08xroqVturFZP8wC72oVlE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Otros Usos","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
