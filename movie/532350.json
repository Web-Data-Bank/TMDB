Unsure of what to do with his life, as well as a penchant for medieval philosophy, Alexander rambles across the land of enchantment over one normally ablaze summer in search of something bigger than himself. Or maybe just something to do. Whether it be venturing out to find illegal substances with a sensitive burnout or visiting his glump of a younger brother, Alexander makes it his goal to live in the past as presently as he can. What transpires is a journey into the mindset of an unquestionably difficult young man, an aspiring thinker who believes there is little to no purpose in his life - other than to declare his superiority among everyone he meets. The General Specific is an aggressive comedy that ponders the kooks and silliness, as well as the loneliness and resentment, that plagues one modern day picaro.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dgBK3j3suikj7bZip0gOT5drqlz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The General Specific","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
