A woman sits at her desk typing. Outside, the Canadian winter holds the land in its grip. Snow flurries drift past the window. The woman makes coffee, waits for the mail to arrive, sits in thought. We wait for the disaster to strike. At the end of the day, another woman enters the apartment and asks how the day went. The end.  The accumulation of non-events gradually strips us of all the clich√©s of dramatic action, and we are made aware that our actual lives are always like this.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/z28C27CMgtoEY3HohYpTkIZD3zD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1991-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Interference","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
