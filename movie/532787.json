This bleak portrait of loneliness and social exclusion is set on the edge of a desolate swamp where an aging clown and his daughter are struggling to survive. The location could be the end of the world, a place where hope has vanished along with a belief in the afterlife and the existence of God. The two unfortunates live together without the likelihood of change, as fear, aggression, and anger take hold of them – but they also experience sudden moments of tenderness.","popularity":1.183,"poster_path":"/qYIMiVtlTI0YZgcf1y0ooHbxZtO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80721,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sonder Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2019-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A chronicle of the relationship between a paranoid schizophrenic clown and his blind daughter.","title":"Reflections in the Dust","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
