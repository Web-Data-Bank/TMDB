The film’s ride on the bumpy road to equality in Utah offers a glimpse at the Mormon church’s influence in state politics and the squabbles inside the gay community that nearly derailed a chance to make history.  Church & State is a story of triumph, setback and a little-known lawsuit that should have failed, but instead paved the way for a U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized gay unions nationwide.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/i6NieNz1By25uFE5md1M94ZtAFr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Church & State","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":8}
