Told as a series of texts between two friends dreading their plan to hang out, “On My Way” directed by Mary Dauterman is a 90 second comedy about not wanting to leave the house. We watch in split screen as the two young women — one snacking and watching TV; the other, lounging comfortably in bed — prep for their supposed night out, “what should I wear?” “idk something cute.” Perfectly capturing the low-key lies and excuses we employ to avoid our friends, the social maneuvering and indecisiveness on display is a telling time capsule of millennial relationships and a hilarious bit of self-deprecation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1KkbKykY0Sp6GXbzd4tzyJhtZvi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On My Way","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
