As his family comes together to celebrate the holiday, the combined forces of the suffocating Chilean heat, free-flowing drinks, and repressed desire contribute to the eruption of long-held secrets. Both an enticing family melodrama and an explicit erotic thriller, this is a story about the ways that passion and desire control our lives - from pop-culture tastes to sexual fantasies.","popularity":2.273,"poster_path":"/UgBqOs9lUkrvE3huMky3I6ttdP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60367,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinépata","origin_country":"CL"},{"id":116246,"logo_path":null,"name":"Masa Madre","origin_country":"CL"},{"id":116247,"logo_path":null,"name":"Matrriarca Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2018-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Drink responsibly","title":"Cola de mono","video":false,"vote_average":4.9,"vote_count":24}
