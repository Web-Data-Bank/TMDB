Indeed the place is almost deserted except by four faithful patrons, Francis, a garage owner, Pivois, a man with a modest private income, Loulou, a radio technician and Boudoux, an undertaker. Now, the Robustals employ a fanciful but gifted waiter, Hippolyte. This one happens to be infatuated with Liliane, so much so that one day he takes out a life insurance in her favor. The four regulars' reaction is instant: they offer Robustal to execute Hippolyte, in exchange for a commission. But the trouble (at least for them!) is that Hippolyte is indestructible.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/j0sODlMUuJq7cRvxx4gDkdK0cCw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1959-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Indestructible","video":false,"vote_average":0.5,"vote_count":1}
