Learn the ways of the force, or use his wit to diffuse situations. That wit would soon lead to winning first prize in the, ‘So You Think You’re Funny Contest’ and the beginning of his stand-up comedy career. He was no longer the shy introverted kid, drawing cartoons in the corner. He had finally found his voice. A voice he would later use to direct and voice over twenty Saturday Morning cartoons. This former mobile disc jockey, who used to play songs at weddings, now sings song parodies on nationally syndicated radio shows, like the Bob and Tom Show. Take his Obama Man, sung to the tune of Candy Man, which has racked up over 4 million hits on YouTube.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9Bardx7hBE9ACYdWJMkBCdRUU1C.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91789,"logo_path":"/vewmadL3CfwSGtwszA1Y58cVmyg.png","name":"VidAngel Studios","origin_country":"US"},{"id":141791,"logo_path":"/QDpxxoQKLQEya7mJWtFLQt7Mm2.png","name":"Dry Bar Comedy","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Greg Morton: I Started Out, as a Baby","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
