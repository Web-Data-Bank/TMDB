When I was a child, there was a book I always used to read when I went to the hospital. One day as I was reading it as I always did, suddenly the ending had changed. Sometime later, when I read it again, it had returned to normal.  —  In our everyday routine, there are moments when suddenly we feel like something is different; this unexpected change, like in my memory, feels like it has a kind of reality. This impression is at the core of “KiyaKiya” and the related painting and drawing series.  —","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rEmCg9pgN2PPSsLkAADrrP3Kl35.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"KiyaKiya","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
