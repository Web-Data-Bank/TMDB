Never allowing itself to be fully comprehendible, the film maneuvers through the unknown with a bizarre, darkly comedic vision. To begin, the man receives a message from an ominous visitor (himself?) suggesting he have a party. Agreeing, he goes upstairs to get ready, and that's where an immortal soul (embodied as a single pea on the floor) catches his attention and leads him on a voyage through time and space. The gloriously strange conceit is delivered with enigmatic visuals and atmospheres and leaves a haunting impression.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"His Heart Lived in Lonesome Valley","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
