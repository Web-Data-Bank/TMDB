Seven Irish revolutionaries have taken over a post office, totally evacuating the building. Or so they think. They missed Gertie Gertel, who was in the bathroom at the time. By the time she is discovered, they are sufficiently besieged that for her own safety, she must stay with them. Gertie, it turns out, is about as pro-British as it is possible to be, and the seven take it on themselves, in the midst of battles and gunfights, to win her over to their cause.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/38yvfnv3alkfbOq5nB5bjq2CqVr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Is Always Too Good to Women","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
