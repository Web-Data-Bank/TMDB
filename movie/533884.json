Among the sketches performed is one with Jean Carmet playing a man from the sticks woefully burdened with the challenge of getting through a dog food commercial on less than one tank of intelligible French. Another skit shows a silent duel between an airport custodian and an automatic door, while another with the renowned Michel Galabru sets up a strange teacher-student exchange.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3pHuZ6lpMmBC1qxL2C1HXEvSTrJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Follow My Gaze","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
