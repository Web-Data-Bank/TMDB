Not such a remarkable event in itself, but Petula touched Harry's forearm during the duet and made TV history. It was the first time a white woman had touched a black man on US television. The sponsor insisted the touch be cut from the programme, the programme makers refused. In the decade’s “year of revolt”, Clark found herself at the centre of a media controversy involving race, censorship and endemic bigotry in a newly desegregated yet depressingly divided US.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uiGeRuqmCbQtEtdWKpwrbbGiFK5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5253,"logo_path":"/cxgRBXMNcbcE0dIaeCc4tbDa4KI.png","name":"NBC Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":108198,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rodan Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":36635,"logo_path":null,"name":"Steve Binder Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1968-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An infamous television special with Petula Clark, which is remembered for what happened off screen.","title":"Petula","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
