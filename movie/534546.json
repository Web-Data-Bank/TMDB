If not for a young woman named Mērija Grīnberga, the exhibition halls of many museums in Latvia would be empty today. Grīnberga was the only volunteer who in 1944 went along with the train carrying the treasures of Latvian art in order to return with them back to Riga. The German occupying forces tried to take them away; the Soviet occupation forces brought them back; Mērija completed her duty. As gratitude for her journey, Mērija was sacked from her job at the museum and incessantly viewed with suspicion.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/swWfltlFR24QiVbSg0IoPYqpfUq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":146136,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vivat!","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2018-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mērija's Journey","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
