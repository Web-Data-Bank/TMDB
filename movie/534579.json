Ann tries to get a bashful hotel clerk to marry her in name only, and then get a divorce, but he refuses to because he is in love with her. Her cousin then brings in another clerk and Ann now has two men on her hands. Ann now wants to marry the first clerk, having discovered she also loves him, but the aunts object. She then hires two gigolos to charm her aunts into a compromising situation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jkZhP04SqrKfJnPYAE1Vo0qJ3Le.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3245,"logo_path":"/9dBTQp9XitrHkx20i1r9HhZ3Q6B.png","name":"First National Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1926-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"1,404 sure laughs! 1,293 sure thrills! 1926 on the laugh pan - it's a knockout!","title":"Ladies at Play","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
