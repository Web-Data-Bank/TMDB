Apart from that, he has been a member of the Taiwanese parliament since 2016, sitting on the committees for National Defence and Foreign Affairs. He is a member of a coalition working closely with Taiwan's first-ever female president. The film accompanies the rock star politician for his first year in political office as he opposes China's policy towards Taiwan and Tibet. As an activist fighting for human rights, he meets with the Dalai Lama, but also takes part in Donald Trump's inauguration even though he has many reservations about him. Freddy Lim is on the front line. But he still occasionally puts on his face paint and sings in a diabolical voice at the front of his black metal band. Strangely, the two worlds are coming together.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8qZEofMJAnwbq1biQNAtKjR1O0y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2018-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Tibetan","iso_639_1":"bo","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Metal Politics Taiwan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
