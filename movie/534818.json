Why did it seem to you, before you met Him, that He was the only Prince Charming in the world, and now you cannot even remember your first date with Him? Why is it that, when thinking of the past, you believe you have made a mistake and can only sigh sadly, \"If only it would have...\"? It seems to the 35-year-old Yekaterina Kolesnikova that her life got on to the wrong track: instead of being a model on the catwalk in Milan she works in a factory making working clothes. And her husband, a once brilliant and talented musician, has turned out to be a local finance officer.
