It was conceived and employed as part of the propaganda machinery of Salazar's regime.  Screened in cinema theatres prior to the main feature film, each issue of Jornal had approximately ten minutes in length and covered a variety of official government acts, national political news, major sports events and other assorted social and cultural affairs. Jornal Português is not only an indispensable document for the history of Estado Novo's propaganda, but also an unparalleled audiovisual archive of 1940s Portugal.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nornNj7qFqFYzHXYsafICL3IOWm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":1018,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jornal Português (1938-1951)","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
