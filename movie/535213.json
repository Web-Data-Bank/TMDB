It is the story of a couple forced together, coming to realise that what they each wish for is to be one another. It is a story about the point at which life is death, love is loneliness, man is woman and dream is reality. Five weeks from initial concept to shot and made on the barest of budgets, the film is an unprecedented undertaking that brings to life a dream from beyond the grave. Ema Nudar Umanu is a romance of liberty, draped in tragedy, comic and absurd.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tNUIL0MjsXvrQQz9u3ZyCyW75jk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":141886,"logo_path":null,"name":"Malkriado Cinema","origin_country":"TL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TL","name":"Timor-Leste"}],"release_date":"2018-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A surreal, fable-like meditation on life, death and spirituality in Timor-Leste.","title":"Person Being/in the Nature of a Human","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
