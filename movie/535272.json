Don’t watch this off-beat jukebox cartoon expecting any conventional soccer action. Equal parts Disney, Dali and Duchamp, this abstract mix of black and white photos and alternative comix style animation is accompanied by a medley of doo-wop classics and documentary soundbites.  The film is certainly an extreme departure for those familiar with the more conventional output of the Halas & Batchelor studio, best known for their feature-length version of George Orwell’s Animal Farm (1954). Paul Vester was one of a number of sixties art school graduates that brought a mix of pop art and illustration influences to the company whilst it was undergoing a brief change in its ownership. As a warning, in keeping with its progressive, adult style there is some brief nudity at the end of the film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6EClR7YzQodm7oqS4wi3HFlKxQW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3626,"logo_path":null,"name":"Halas and Batchelor Cartoon Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1971-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Football Freaks","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
