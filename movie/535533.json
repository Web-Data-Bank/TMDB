He possesses a supernatural sense of hearing, so strong he can hear through solid walls and over great distances. But Babak is not the only one with bizarre, unexplained powers. A group of extraordinary individuals begin to emerge and find each other. Will they learn to use their powers for anything other than their own selfish means? With experimental sequences and innovative camerawork, director Iraj Karimi takes a whimsical look at a band of youths brought together through their abilities, but bound by their lack of purpose.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7zcncG3xuY8w6eSvFQZYm3ndcpZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2006-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Magic Generation","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
