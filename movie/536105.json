A key element of her personal life is the capacity to question and a willingness to switch tack if the answers she finds require it. This is the dynamic that roused her interest in the struggle for Ireland’s independence and then propelled her towards pacifism. It sparked her deep thirst for social justice, which eventually concluded in her exit from the world of politics.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2018-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Five Red Roses","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
