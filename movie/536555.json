The man releases all the hermit crabs in his hotel. Large numbers of hermit crabs are spread in the room. They move freely; on the bed, on the desk, sometimes they fall into the floor, and some of them get into the refrigerator. They seem like nothing was happened, and they don't even care about taking video by the man. It is a silent happening, but also paranormal.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/b0qagxDVIFwumrjNMCoO7DjnI6C.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2012-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silent Passengers","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":1}
