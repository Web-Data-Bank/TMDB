A female voice reads a mythological text on the origin of the world and sets the tone for a documentary-meditation on the presence of primeval elements – like water and flora – and their cohabitation with the natives, whose portraits intersperse the film. The stealthy camera follows a boat drifting across the calm waters of a river, as if the latter were the rings of a tree disclosing its history, in a movement that lulls us and drives us to the physical and metaphysical core. Finally, accompanied by an ancestral chant, the etching gives way to a sequence of images (which in turn emerge like a river reducing the field of action to the essential) and moves into a poetic terrain, summoning the imagination of each one.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rnuCSCeTX1Sg4hgwoTwk0qQNw0d.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PE","name":"Peru"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2018-07-20","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Strong Waters","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":4}
