The focus on the everyday activities of women (the core trope of Akerman’s masterpiece Jeanne Dielman) is a recurring theme in much of her work; Femmes d'Anvers signals a return to this motif. In it, Akerman tackles the thorny question of a person’s fundamental freedom to choose what to do with his or her body.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/39tdsVuj7EkupQuu1HOZBtKCFBp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10645,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paradise Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Women from Antwerp in November","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
