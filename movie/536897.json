The young Dekel tries pulling himself together from a painful break-up. Within the imprecision of a natural backdrop dipped into the sweetness of the moon, he stumbles upon his friend Doron whose lit-up shoes spread light visible kilometres away. Along with two other boys, they are going to spend the night talking away: talk as much as possible, in a final attempt to give life back to what they share.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4H5wfKq3XF06KRXFhLcxA9IA6sr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102903,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paradisier Zootrope Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thunder from the Sea","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
