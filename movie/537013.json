He meets a beautiful young woman and pursues her, but she dismisses his attentions because she thinks he is just a barber. Also pursuing the woman is the evil Capt. Remy, whom she also brushes off. He, however, doesn't take rejection so lightly, and forges papers \"proving\" that the girl is a \"quadroon\"--part black, which means that she can be sold as a slave. She is sold to Capt. Remy, and when Victor hears of it, he determines to rescue her.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p1SfrVYnlyN0DmHVlweiTxOW8we.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3245,"logo_path":"/9dBTQp9XitrHkx20i1r9HhZ3Q6B.png","name":"First National Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1927-12-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"She was his slave---bought and paid for---and now he was protecting her with his life.
