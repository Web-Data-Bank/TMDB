The filmmaker managed to persuade the retired artists of the Szapito group to go back to the circus arena. The spectator knows that the life, characters and their acts recorded on the film stock will soon be gone forever. It is with sympathy and reverie that Dziworski observes this world fade away.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/soo4A3oXAW8p9HiYyiOaJifdHjc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Szapito","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
