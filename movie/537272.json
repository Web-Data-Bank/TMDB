Eric shared a perspective on skiing and filmmaking with fellow pro skiers Pep Fujas, Andy Mahre and Chris Benchetler. Together, four of the world's most influential skiers decided to set out and make ski films that represent the sport as they see it. What is it about skiing? The Nimbus Independent crew tries to answer that question. This film showcases skiing that is more fun and enjoyable for everyone, more about fluidity and style than amplitude or quantity of rotations, it breaks from the norm of pro athletes hitting jump after jump with a couple contrived lifestyle segments, to producing a project that communicates what ski culture is and the community it creates through the eyes of Pep Fujas, Eric Pollard, Chris Benchetler, Ike Smith, Andy Mahre and their friends.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6AHwlmsJBt5yaZKorvoFhqUlFph.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11121,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nimbus Independent","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hunting Yeti","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
