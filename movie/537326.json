She was one of the greatest American photographers of the 20th Century. From her portraits of the avant-garde taken in Paris during the 1920's, to her documentation of New York in the 1930's, to her science photography of the 1950s, and her studies of small-town America, Abbott's genius is in the incredible range of her work. Filmed during her 91st and 92nd years, the open-hearted Abbott takes us on a guided tour of her century. The tour teaches history, perseverance, courage, and single-minded dedication to one's chosen field. A brilliant film about a brilliant American artist!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jxutJqdSJrt4AtPn3W1V5aK6vfm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":106934,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ishtar Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Berenice Abbott: A View of the 20th Century","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
