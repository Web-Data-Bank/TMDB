All suspects in crimes that strongly shook the nation - Shoko Asahara from the 1995 Aum Tokyo subway gas attacks, Masumi Hayashi from the “poisoned curry” murder case in Wakayama, an unnamed minor from the murder case of a mother and her child in the city of Hikari - have all been sentenced to death.  64-year-old Yoshihiro Yasuda is a lawyer who defends the ‘undefendable’: the death row convicts in court, while suffering slander from the Japanese public and media.  This documentary analyzes a number of death-row cases in Japan, and attitudes towards the accused and to the death penalty itself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iJvWmZ48hZzwZT9qQNc0GEYwv0F.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2012-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Defender of Death-row Convicts","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
