It clicks, pounds, whooshes, hums, and crackles around the quietly resounding basic theme of the piece. The abstract visual level emphasises the soundtrack, suggesting a digital score, and is vaguely reminiscent of music applications, the user-interface of composition software. At the same time the minimalist images suggest a continual forwards movement, gliding ahead on a parallel voyage through the virtual space: mobile geometry.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"rewind","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
