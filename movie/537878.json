Egor is a great family man, respected by his fellow villagers. He and his wife Natalia are expecting a second child. Unexpectedly, Egor finds out that he has terminal cancer and has only two months left to live. No traditional medicine or shamanic magic can save Egor. Finally, left with no other options, he decides to take the last desperate step. He attempts to completely change his identity in order to fool the oncoming death, just like Zhamba the drake, the hero of a legendary ancient Siberian epos, did.","popularity":2.038,"poster_path":"/jP6a1bKf5vmmFdxxNJoEDkoLD0T.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5630,"logo_path":"/s0mHCw53fp6EAapR7g0dwYbz0l5.png","name":"Non-Stop Productions","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":108152,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pan-Atlantic Studio","origin_country":""},{"id":6144,"logo_path":"/iarVMSGDqo8sAHPxz6duesUBRXG.png","name":"Homeless Bob Production","origin_country":"EE"},{"id":87271,"logo_path":"/tXxU8K5C9HoApztCgBb7OgmxTPd.png","name":"Arizona Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2018-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"How far are you willing to go to fight for your life?","title":"The Man Who Surprised Everyone","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":12}
