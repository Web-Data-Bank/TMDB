Remarkably, her father's epistolary accounts of his daily life as a soldier also include fantastical watercolour illustrations of his travels, which Meter incorporates to movingly amplify the emotional resonance of a father-daughter bond made fraught by distance and war.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sC7RBDPzK80Kl1ffgSMlg6qW5rl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Up to the Sky and Much Much More","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
