No matter the place or the circumstances, be it day or night, he’s on the phone, handling the cargo ships he charters for major companies. But when he has to deal with a crisis situation, Frank makes a brutal decision and gets fired. Profoundly shaken, betrayed by a system to which he gave his all, he has to progressively question himself to save the one connection that still matters to him: the bond he’s managed to maintain with his youngest daughter, Mathilde.","popularity":4.785,"poster_path":"/tM4qXipwgHeiw8mN2JyWPBCSvk8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6003,"logo_path":"/mEswQx1seYJjA2knd0lrdDGvxvu.png","name":"Box Productions","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":7465,"logo_path":"/e28RwIpRcOSFaeKkzLQBzvMXbK0.png","name":"Novak Prod","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":13668,"logo_path":"/azhapBvZ8g1UWyyQQhhcRR9bM9x.png","name":"RTS","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":792,"logo_path":"/cRhBQP1FFNugNxKkO1pUgeD2Rkr.png","name":"RTBF","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":26027,"logo_path":"/sHNTPJu0ePn5PqHRcA6nncNWN0L.png","name":"Teleclub","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2018-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Those Who Work","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":69}
