Unhappy with the existing social and political situation in Turkey, a group of military officers has planned a coup d’état to take down the government in Ankara. Meanwhile in Istanbul, their conspirators have undertaken the vital mission of taking over the National Radio station and making a formal announcement about the coup. But nothing goes to plan. Faced with a number of obstacles, including a sudden rainstorm, the absence of the radio station technician, a betrayal, the lack of feedback from Ankara and their very own inefficiency, the conspirators scramble to keep their plan on track and announce the success of the coup – that is, if the coup in the capital has taken place at all.","popularity":1.103,"poster_path":"/8ur9dDGZpjrzxfiOl68AuBMAeil.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72961,"logo_path":"/dB3hzWWWBSK8U6M4ZLEBUOQj4UE.png","name":"Chouchkov Brothers","origin_country":"BG"},{"id":25350,"logo_path":"/cVSmWXOANMlHpDObhi2nOJ83PDf.png","name":"BKM","origin_country":"TR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","name":"Bulgaria"},{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"2019-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The night long journey of the 4 soldiers discharged from the army.","title":"The Announcement","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":14}
