Call it a colony. Call it a village. Call it one-world. Mainly call it a futile exercise in changing human nature, mores, culture and attitudes at any altitude. For t'ain't no time before clashing personalities, petty jealousy, violence and---that old demon---love create havoc. And isn't much longer before they become re-united in the face of an avalanche that threatens to destroy them. They all return to whence they came, sadder and wiser.","popularity":0.627,"poster_path":"/pszb0XvJWj0L2o0GzGlNd8ZWl1H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1723,"logo_path":null,"name":"Transcontinental Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1938-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Youth in Revolt","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
