For example when there is a masquerade ball. Indeed wearing flea-ridden rags might just mean having donned a costume. This is what happens to two resourceful Brussels bums, La Cloche and Picolard, who manage to gain entry in a fancy-dress ball. Once there, La Cloche is mistaken by an oriental prince for a respected doctor. His mission will be to give care to a music-hall diva. Even more exciting, he is asked to vaccinate a whole troupe of showgirls. Trouble guaranteed.","popularity":0.841,"poster_path":"/AqF2GZElw5vrAiAjT1gPQLzq4Ua.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":173014,"logo_path":null,"name":"Agence Centrale Cinématographique","origin_country":""},{"id":173015,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Exclusivités Artistiques","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"1938-01-07","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Precious Fools","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
