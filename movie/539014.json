The traditional roles within their marriage have given them 30 years of routine stability. The opening of a family business and the discovery of dance effect a radical transformation in Núria. At 56, Núria looks back reflecting on her past… and she decides to reinvent herself. Joan, sensitive and introverted, feels more and more distant from the Nuri of his youth, and misses her. She is not willing to go back to how things were. This documentary project, wrenched from the heart, gives us the inevitable reflection on the harsh human condition.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bvSYCtENQy67Qr09ispVxDXLNJD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Since You Dance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
