An intimate portrait of her songwriting process and personal struggles—depression, insomnia, and an eating disorder—the piece follows her journey from hospitals and rehab to a triumphant performance of “Praying” at the 2018 GRAMMY® awards. “It’s called Rainbow because after the storm, there’s a rainbow,” she says in the film. “I wrote it as a message to myself that I could make it through.” The film includes music video clips, live performances, and footage of the singer writing and recording with Ben Folds, the Dap-Kings, and Sandra Williams.","popularity":1.189,"poster_path":"/h0eGoASfTwBSHOnaiNQamLjzyJr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73205,"logo_path":"/ofXzr1e3jX164dIWWpWQQnZaJBP.png","name":"Magic Seed Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":14801,"logo_path":"/bnlD5KJ5oSzBYbEpDkwi6w8SoBO.png","name":"Apple","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"You.
