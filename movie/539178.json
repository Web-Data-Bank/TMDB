The film intertwines these images with excerpts of his oeuvre, thus creating a fluid and cinematic continuum. In his score for Living the Light Jim Jarmusch gives this wide raging scale of life and art an additional musical voice.","popularity":1.284,"poster_path":"/zVoDODhgItHovC11TOdTASRqRYz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107166,"logo_path":null,"name":"Moondocs","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2018-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Living the Light: Robby Müller","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":4}
