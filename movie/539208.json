Now his quatrains are predicting our immediate future and it would seem the end times are truly upon the world. According to the new interpretations, Nostradamus predicted that a mighty Islamic army of terror would rise up and set in motion World War III. China would conquer the entire East and much of the globe, and then a complete collapse of technology would spin the world into chaos like never before as the Antichrist rises in the West. Explore the prophecies and decide for yourself.","popularity":1.232,"poster_path":"/mwvv7S3UExVpx34yCEX6GnBXFVk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12885,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reality Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-07-30","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"2020 Nostradamus","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
