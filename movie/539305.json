In 2006, in honor of the 50th anniversary of the creation of Candide, the Théâtre du Châtelet in Paris produced a new production under the direction of Robert Carsen. The production transforms the proscenium into a giant 1950s-era TV set, and has Voltaire, appearing as the narrator, changing channels between certain scenes. Carsen sets the action in a 1950s/1960s world, with an American slant commenting on contemporary world politics. This production was filmed and broadcast on Arte.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/loPxTl9gHCFvIUff44yq0ux70iZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Candide","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
