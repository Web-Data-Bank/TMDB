He hurries to tell Venus, Goddess of Beauty, that her loveliness is surpassed by a mortal. The jealousy of Venus is aroused and she orders her son, Cupid, the God of Love, to avenge the indignity. One glance at Psyche and Cupid revolts. He beseeches his mother to relent, but Venus is deaf to his pleading and swears to destroy her rival's powers. While joy reigns in the court of Psyche's father, Venus strikes at Psyche by inflicting an illness upon the king. His malady baffles all, and in desperation the queen consults the oracle. The oracle decrees that when Psyche marries a mortal her father will be saved. However, Psyche's husband will be a monster who will devour her.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1913-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le mariage de l'amour","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
