Using the five-part structure of both the poem and the composition to reflect on the key moments and events which have shaped postcolonial histories, Transfigured Night mirrors the relationship between postcolonial subject and state with that of Dehmel’s lovers – speaking to the fleeting promises and ensuing disappointments of the post-colonial state.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4W3Xfj5MscvXMelM8wWyVEt43ji.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Transfigured Night","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
