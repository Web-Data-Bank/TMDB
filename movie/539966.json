Lucien wanders about the streets of Paris and meets Joëlle, a sophisticated teenager who supports herself with a job in a sleazy nightclub. It is late when they meet, and Joëlle invites Lucien into the club and demonstrates her stripping act to her one-man audience. A feeling of rapport develops as they go from place to place seeking entertainment; in the morning the two discover they have fallen in love. Mireille learns of the romance and, on a bet, plots with Philippe and other friends to break up the affair. Neither Lucien nor Joëlle, however, succumbs to the propositions of Mireille and Philippe. Later at a nightclub, Mario gives the appearance of seducing Joëlle. Enraged, Lucien rushes at him and they fight. Lucien is reunited with Joëlle--he has learned of the complexities of love, and she has acquired from him a sense of stability.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wzgQ6DgLe089bwkBoCH0mrEmutL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37078,"logo_path":null,"name":"International Thanos Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1961-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Nymphettes with the faces of angels…their manners and their morals in the world of Paris after dark!","title":"First Taste of Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
