Pedestrians shuffle across a bustling Beijing street, steelworkers linger outside a deserted factory, tourists laugh and scamper across a crowded beach, worshippers kneel to pray in a remote village. With a painterly eye for composition, Wang captures China as he sees it, calling to a temporary halt a land in a constant state of change.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vnYE6x5DAB7Rc2NRUcAM6au2bwe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17039,"logo_path":null,"name":"WXS Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":107290,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dongchun Films (Beijing) Co.","origin_country":""},{"id":17040,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chinese Shadows","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2018-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chinese Portrait","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":7}
