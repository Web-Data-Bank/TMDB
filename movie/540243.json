Unlike some of the \"we're only in it for the money\" reunions, X-Ray Spex are in great form. The twenty-track set includes almost the entirety of Germ Free Adolescents (\"Plastic Bag\" is the only track not played) and Poly Styrene's voice has held up exceptionally well given that Germ Free Adolescents was released thirty years ago. Other songs include three tracks from X-Ray Spex's 2005 reunion Conscious Consumer along with one new and previously unreleased track \"Bloody War\".","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/esvYeaTbZckSNLzKJnydj0Ea5GK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107318,"logo_path":null,"name":"Future Noise","origin_country":""},{"id":107319,"logo_path":null,"name":"Poly Styrene","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2009-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"X-Ray Spex: Live at the Roundhouse London","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
