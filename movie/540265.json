Apollo, god of art, beauty and divinations, incites all sorts of rumors, even the craziest ones. The Apollo of Gaza is at once an inquiry and a meditation on history, plunging us into the barely known reality of a territory that is still paying the price of wars and a merciless blockade, but where life also subsists, undefeated. By bringing a little light to the sky of Gaza, the statue and its stupefying story could return some dignity and hope to all people.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/gIEP9glJpUOURQ0PNm3y5sTWnsm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16277,"logo_path":"/wVZrimZweNIYZ0BDRINDZF9W2TJ.png","name":"Akka Films","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":13668,"logo_path":"/azhapBvZ8g1UWyyQQhhcRR9bM9x.png","name":"RTS","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2020-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Apollo of Gaza","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4}
