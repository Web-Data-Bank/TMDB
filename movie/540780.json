It was originally shot super 8 and re-filmed from two projectors to create various super impositions. For Novaczek, this is a film about what she terms “the typical Jewish London woman of (her) generation”, who grew up in the 1960s, denying her culture and sexuality, only to try to come to terms with it during the tumultuous Thatcherite 1980s.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/4knirF2s6dUrINUd9KMoAMJg6fG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tea Leaf","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
