Du Cane’s rarely shown films are amongst the most pure and radical of their period. Instinctive yet formal, structured and organic, the physical world is turned into a screen-based labyrinth that is both surface and depth, through the retinal rush of incremental superimpositions and delicate cameral control.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tXz4GxY7qjRy6r2XCoK4PXcPLP7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1973-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sign","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
