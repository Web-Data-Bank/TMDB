It’s a cinematic journey into the world of dreams, filled with memories, desires, and the incessant quest for the ever-elusive happiness.  The trains have played an important role in the history of cinema. A lot of interesting phenomena are linked with trains – locomotion, changes, an opportunity to think, dynamics, force, sense of something important… It helps to cross the usual boundaries.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kyrWsyQ49yQgnCKtncUc4xClHG0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97759,"logo_path":null,"name":"Camera Obscura","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2016-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Only Trains Remember That","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
