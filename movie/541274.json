After an extended opening sequence at Waterloo and footage of Nine Elms shed, we follow the former London & South Western main line down to Basingstoke. We head west from Worthing Junction to Salisbury before resuming our journey south through Eastleigh to Southampton. There follows some delightful scenes filmed in the New Forest including steam workings on the branch to Lymington. This brings us to Bournemouth where we see the town s two stations and the splendid yellow trolley buses which used to link them. Before reaching the end of our travels at Weymouth there are some superb scenes of trains labouring up the bank out of the town and coverage of a Channel Islands Boat Train on the famous Weymouth Tramway filmed in 1958.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tKovdH7tR1EMfrarDb3t0XAmrv7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107510,"logo_path":null,"name":"Demand Media Ltd","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vol 1 - Waterloo Sunset","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
