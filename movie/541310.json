Millions of baseball fans remember him as the powerhouse slugger who earned one of the sports rare statistics: 40/40. But millions more remember him as the whistleblower whose admission to steroids juicing exposed a scandal that overshadowed his remarkable career and led to the Congressional hearings that cast a pall over America's greatest pastime, baseball. Now, Jose finally speaks out. What emerges is a nuanced portrait of a man driven by grief and a promise made. Only time will tell whether history remembers Jose Canseco as a legend, a whistleblower or a scapegoat. But this candid documentary will leave audiences convinced of one inescapable fact.  The Truth Hurts.","popularity":0.778,"poster_path":"/qlckTuNXkijs74Wztzb3lPSKI2e.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107544,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fort Worth Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jose Canseco: The Truth Hurts","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":3}
