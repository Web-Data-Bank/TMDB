After taking over the family business, her sharp shooting act is the only thing keeping the declining Orbeliani Circus afloat. When a stranger and his dog drifts into her home town of Batumi, Georgia from the Black Sea, peddling his own act, Natia wonders if a change of fortune is finally on the horizon. As the circus's prospects begin to rise so do suspicions that the stranger is not who he seems. A fateful interaction forces changes upon Natia and she must leave her family to protect them from what she is becoming. Soon, she is traveling to a different city-by-the-bay, San Francisco, where confrontation and opportunity release a violent darkness rooting within her. Fighting against her loneliness and the rules of this new world, she is befriended by a troubled young artist with an innocent soul. Will this tenuous love lead her out of the darkness? Or, are they merely two halves of broken whole?","popularity":0.876,"poster_path":"/bz4vbv5i35RT12b4NB31CuFsLXa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sacred Blood","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
