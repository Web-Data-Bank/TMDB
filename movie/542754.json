The seven discs included in this three-volume set have virtually all of Lloyd's 1920s features, most of his talking pictures, and a healthy collection of shorts. Because Lloyd--a canny businessman--retained control over much of his output, the films have remained under his (and his estate's) control through the decades, and the quality of the key titles is generally excellent.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/t0xM8bboZd69DnpmGLr70KgbTEr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"he Harold Lloyd Comedy Collection Vols. 1-3","title":"The Harold Lloyd Comedy Collection Vols. 1-3","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
