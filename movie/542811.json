This is a problem of society’s responsibility to its future. The war ended long ago, but the children’s homes were overflowing in the 1960s. When I found out about this, I was simply dumbfounded. I did not want to read the viewers a lecture, but hoped to affect them on an emotional level. This is one of my most beloved pictures. This is a motto of kindness, mercy, a message from man to the individual, this is the problem of a person’s responsibility to the future” (director Mikhail Litvyakov).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6ApqH0qk5xAYBTft8fPVkuw9Lqn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1966-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Goodbye, Mother","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
