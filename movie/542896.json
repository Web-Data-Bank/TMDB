When Japan surrendered to the U. S. at the end of World War II, numerous Japanese swords were confiscated and taken back to the States. The Japanese Sword, while once a symbol of wartime aggression, is also deeply embedded in Japan’s rich history and spiritual heritage. In order to better understand the past and build a bridge between cultures in the present, an American filmmaker attempts to return one of these surrendered swords to its original owner.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/g2nD6BN2WBD5MaWtiXkd4IJcnA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-07-31","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forgive - Don't Forget","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
