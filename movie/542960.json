Conceived in the 1950s by architects Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret, Chandigarh’s controversial modernist architecture includes original pieces of furniture—tables, chairs, settees, desks—created specifically for the building’s interiors. Recently these pieces have appeared at auction houses around the world, commanding record prices. Starting with the Chandigarh furniture in the present, the film begins in New York apartments, London townhouses, Belgian villas and Paris salons of avid collectors. From there, it moves backwards to the furniture’s sale at auction, preview exhibitions, and photography for auction catalogues, to restoration, cargo shipping containers, and Indian ports — ending finally in Chandigarh, a city in a state of entropy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vvMDlpJMZqbvXXIo5MNfbiZusQh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Provenance","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
