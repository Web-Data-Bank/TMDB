The family fled from Somalia during the civil war and now lives scattered around the globe. When Yasmin's grandmother no longer wants to stay in her Ethiopian exile, a transnational family drama evolves, circling around the essential question: Where is Granny to live? And suddenly, the family confronts their own aspirations: Have they actually arrived where they want to be? GLOBAL FAMILY is a twistful documentary about a transnational family drama, in which four generations of a refugee family each pursue their own dreams of family, home, and future.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2Q3OnGZtmEZT13FEPQZqmRyKOes.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92062,"logo_path":"/c6y9r3AGLneeHWydhQiE83K7TQG.png","name":"Made In Germany Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-07-28","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Somali","iso_639_1":"so","name":"Somali"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Global Family","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
