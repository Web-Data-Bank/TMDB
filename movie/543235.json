Through its unlikely protagonists, the video considers how the pre-verbal child might represent a site of embodied knowledge. Using slow motion camera, mirrored surfaces and rhythmic editing, the video attempts to depict the complexities of their gesture, rhythm and movement through a process of defamiliarization. Going to the Mountain is an acute, unsentimental portrait of Nico, Grace and Maya, with a score developed in collaboration with Andrew Fogarty, featuring improvised percussion by David Lacey made in response to audio recordings of a 7 month old child as well as newly commissioned soft sculptures by artist Barbara Knezevic.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Going to the Mountain","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
