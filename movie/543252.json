How do we absorb and transform experiences that are funny, bewildering and beautiful – confusing, frightening or sad?  The stories are sentimental and comical, silly and serious. Two statues learn about friendship from identical twins dressed as curtains. A girl with a camera multiplies, disappearing with a flash into TV infinity. Static electricity haunts objects and we take a minute to think about walking up hills…  Music, dance and gesture take over when words won’t work. Small items grow huge and people shrink. The videos are set in a world where things follow a different logic – where they fit together as they do in dreams and in our heads.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wPKacGQKxZ12nyjQLVdHuboRHzA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2016-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Some Shapes Without Edges","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
