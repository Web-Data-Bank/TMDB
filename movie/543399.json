Singular irruption that disappears and blends into nature and its representation. There is no more separation, or so little, between being and the world, yet irreconcilable. The voice is tense, it becomes this arc between nature and the character that seems to bring back to the surface of the screen cinematic flashes forever forgotten. The film of Mahine ROUHI convokes other times which inscribe the transition from one state (psychic, physical) to another. These changes occur at different speeds, on different emulsions according to various treatments. The plasticity that results is not the least quality of this film that revives the mythopoetic cinema. \" Yann BEAUVAIS .","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iddYYZQwkFNZASObuHTO3PNgF6P.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Didam","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
