Questioning the curse of the rare 1930s film reel in their possession, the teens discover the true horrors of The Woodcutter as the boundaries between reality and fantasy become beautifully blurred. The Woodcutter is both a celebration of iconic cinema and an exploration of modern suspense and film noir. With references to classic horror and historic Sydney architecture, it is as much a tribute to the film world as it is a picturesque entertainment piece in its own right.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/96lBheJmCWMcWYJ9cZ82K6D9YnZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Woodcutter","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
