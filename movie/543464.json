Director Tasaka Naoko said: 'I'm pursuing something undistinguishable, with no name or with no boundaries, like something implied in a loose connection of the words in poetry. It's not an unknown thing. It's something which I already know but I donâ€˜t know how to describe. I search in my experience and recollection trying to rebuild something similar with the fragments of my memory.'","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/n3bQRRs1qYc5RaZJuM509DMnMpv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Light Escapes Through the Intervals","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
