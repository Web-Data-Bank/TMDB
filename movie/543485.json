Seeking answers to the existential question “In the midst of chaos, how do you find peace?”, it makes a compelling piece of music theatre as DiDonato journeys through arias by Handel, Purcell, Monteverdi, Leo and Jommelli with Il Pomo d’Oro and conductor Maxim Emelyanychev. On stage, In War and Peace: Harmony through Music makes a compelling piece of music theatre. In Barcelona, as on the European and North American tours she made in late 2016, DiDonato was joined by the baroque orchestra Il Pomo d’Oro and its principal conductor Maxim Emelyanychev. May and June 2018 bring further performances in Portugal, France, Germany, Turkey and Hungary.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9awVsk4HlxknkBIKBLDMh40lHcU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19669,"logo_path":null,"name":"Parlophone","origin_country":""},{"id":52114,"logo_path":"/fQkQoS3C8Vpya8tolBXFTL5ZpMW.png","name":"Camera Lucida Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In War and Peace - Harmony Through Music","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
