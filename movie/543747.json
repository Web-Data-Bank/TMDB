Gradisca and Volpina. Mommy's boys, loose dogs, macho men and strong women. Milan, Rome, Venice, Amarcord, mi recordo, - I remember. What makes you happy? What are you afraid of? How could life have been? Throughout his childhood, the director has longed for Italy, and now he is making a journey from north to south that we can join. Italy's living room is the coffee bar, so of course we meet our everyday heroes there, some are cut out of a Fellini movie. Here we listen to hopes of lottery winnings, talks about football, but also reflect on the great existential questions about what the future can bring.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pUrbf4IWzGP9oJ2kD4Uf6Zaq15B.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46201,"logo_path":null,"name":"Norsk Filmfond","origin_country":""},{"id":107702,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vestnorsk Filmsenter","origin_country":""},{"id":107998,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmkollektivet","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Man Woman Coffee","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
