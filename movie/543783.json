Belford (Belford Press)  Images harvested in Miles MCKANE's garden, with Mahine ROUHI, when we visited Nantes (for a projection of our film \"Tahousse\") in May 2007. Memories of a few happy and sun-filled moments in this little garden, both wild and well-ordered, where the beauty of the art of life leaves an ephemeral imprint on the fragile ribbon of a small mini-DV camera. An amateur video, a holiday movie; complicity and friendship. This moment of magic concludes with a clumsily framed shot of a large red tree in the Jardin des Plantes in Nantes, shot just before taking the train to Grenoble.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2GoxQyWxasrB0QfK708Prjptoxb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Miles 31/05/2007","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
