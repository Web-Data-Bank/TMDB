This film depicts real-life events and most of the situations shown are authentically seen through the eyes of the central protagonist \"Sarabjeet\". It is the story of his journey from innocence to disillusionment, from being a simple, music-loving student to becoming one of the most wanted terrorists in the country. This film is an honest exploration of the reasons which led to the angst of the youth of Punjab and the turmoils suffered by their families.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xLeZsmMfoRMObefemRPOSZcUjp7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-08-22","revenue":0,"runtime":176,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Punjabi","iso_639_1":"pa","name":"ਪੰਜਾਬੀ"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hawayein","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
