Unlike other titles in his canon, Esoterica is completely apropos. Each sequence suggests the inner psychological struggles of seemingly normal people, the whole “private conversation in their head” thing given new and startling voice over reality. They are talking to themselves - and responding. All the standard players are here - icons from the past (Vietnam Ron, Walt Dongo) as well as new faces (Nolan Ballin, Sara Flanders) fresh and buoyant with the boy genius’s love of language. Together, their paint a stunning portrait of human frailty and mental mania.\" (review excerpt by Bill Gibron)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/t0DX7t8MJxQdvgvEtVYGaTGRlUJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Esoterica","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
