In so doing, the program cuts through much of the mythos surrounding the conflict itself and enables us to see the war in a fresh new way. It draws on elements including personal correspondence, diaries, archival photographs and much more. Installments include: \"Rally Round the Flag,\" \"Rebels at the Gates,\" \"High Water Mark,\" \"General Grant's War,\" and \"Jubilation.\"","popularity":1.567,"poster_path":"/tI5Bk4ibKOL6JYFN6BZfWjjKQkx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108127,"logo_path":null,"name":"Image/Madacy Home Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":293,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The American Civil War","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
