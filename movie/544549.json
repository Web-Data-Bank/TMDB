Controversial at the time of its release, Antoinette Sabrier finds Dulac using her bold sense of visual rhythm to achieve a complex portrait of a woman trapped in an unhappy marriage and a nuanced investigation into human intimacy, with her charactersâ€™ emotions expressed through then-innovative cinematic techniques such as slow motion and associative montage. \"  - Film Society of Lincoln Center","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rSS2HIJ8k0NE6XIVMZqlz1n85Fa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1927-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Antoinette Sabrier","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
