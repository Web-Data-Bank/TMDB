He dons sunglasses and waves as she runs down a stairway to the river's edge, then watches in horror as she's knocked flat and loaded into the back of a hearse. In vain, he gives chase. Disconsolate, he buys a large funeral wreath and a handkerchief from sympathetic vendors. He removes the glasses to wipe his eyes and realizes they are the cause of all his woe. He replays the farewell without the glasses.","popularity":2.227,"poster_path":"/hxz3xHtDoV5K4UJA5x8HNnSTtN0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rome Paris Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1961-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fiancés of Macdonald Bridge","video":false,"vote_average":6.452,"vote_count":54}
