Upon learning that his mother was a prostitute, Frank (Daniel Gelin) dejectedly vows that he, too, will live a life of debauchery. Part of his self-degradation program is to kill someone, and since the story takes place during the Nazi occupation of France, he chooses a German officer as his victim. His steady descent into psychosis and depravity becomes his ultimate undoing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jemKpla0wjYLnFFXwNWTS1tIOnC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":93372,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Tellus","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1954-02-19","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stain on the Snow","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":7}
