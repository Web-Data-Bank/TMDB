Both Iimuras play individually as well as a unit. In “Double Portrait” they are never together, but one by one in three points of view, front, side, and back, assigned to the words “I”, “You” and “He/She” respectively. The pronouns rotate with every repetition, for instance, in front view with “You”, then “He/She” and back to “I”. Often the words are destroyed acoustically making them unintelligible. “I Love You” is not a style of confession, but the words, and a linguistic practice using a sentence and shifting the pronouns.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jqh6k6CyPp3SWDjrf0l5TG6MV6R.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Love You","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
