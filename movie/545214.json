This Swedish teenager has just been selected to compete for Twisters, her cheerleading team, and today is her first day with her new teammates. Ruth is passionate about her sport and she socializes easily, so she quickly feels at home among the other athletic girls – munching on their apples as they chat about annoying muscle aches. In this youth documentary, we follow Ruth with her team and at home. Even when surrounded by her family Ruth finds time to focus on her beloved sport – in between squabbling with her brother Johan and joking around with her more levelheaded parents.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7U1WTQsc0X3MlD6NXW1Fv9WGz77.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14803,"logo_path":null,"name":"Story AB","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":29062,"logo_path":"/hwlA6f2HhaOJP1ZcrYL8f8g8UbJ.png","name":"Final Cut for Real","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":61810,"logo_path":"/fCTx5ZgcOvCVCorbgx6hgXdjBrZ.png","name":"Sant \u0026 Usant","origin_country":"NO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2015-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ruth","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
