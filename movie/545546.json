The attack shocks ordinary people on both sides of the Irish Sea.  Sue McHugh, an unassuming and normally shy Dublin housewife, is deeply affected by the tragedy. Spurred into action by the events in Warrington and the hope that she can make a difference, Sue urges people across Ireland to demonstrate that the killings on all sides must stop. But has Sue underestimated the challenge of brokering peace in a community that has known only conflict?  As the grieving Parrys search desperately for answers to their son's senseless killing, they form an alliance with Sue, her husband Arthur, and her Peace '93 movement, travelling to Dublin in a bid to bring about peace and ensure Tim's enduring legacy is one of hope and tolerance. Based on real events.","popularity":2.756,"poster_path":"/dPFh8wbBn6P0qJZjfit8qTdF75U.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80893,"logo_path":"/hFzOkuR4FoZE1U1hvuojMp4Qfxa.png","name":"BBC Studios","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mother's Day","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":4}
