Guided by freewheeling founders James Lebon and Steve Brooks, who met when one was a rockabilly and the other a New Romantic, the salon moved from early â€™80s postpunk roots to become a hip-hop club and communal hub for DJs, photographers and style icons. But the film \"is not just about the haircut\", delivering an intimate portrait of Steve struggling with a traumatic past that threatens to derail the Cuts universe. The film traces profound and often tragic change in the hairdressers' lives within the wider context of the UK's political and cultural landscape- an anthem to the promise of youth and the friendships that endure over a lifetime.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gZo7gPviQ98CvCdpBNBkQRTRBnS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125890,"logo_path":null,"name":"Felt Culture","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Ifs or Buts","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
