In King-Cat, John beautifully renders the \"in-between moments\" - those instances which occupy the bulk of our lives, but can pass easily without notice: Sitting on the front porch. Peeing at a rest stop. Watching a bird. With humor, compassion and a keen eye, John shows readers what they might be missing, and in doing so inspires many to embrace life more fully. Born of the zine revolution of the late eighties/early nineties, King-Cat today is the template for cartoonists who seek to create work that is personal, well-crafted and free of outside influence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/x8QruBOoFjdDA4F9BM2Du5kcfRc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Film About John Porcellino and King-Cat Comics","title":"Root Hog or Die: A Film About John Porcellino and King-Cat Comics","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
