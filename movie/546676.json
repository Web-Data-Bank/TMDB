Accompanied by the extracts of a diary written by the protagonist standing behind the camera, the images translate into a singular and transformative intimate experience. Mladen Kovačević constructs a film using sequences retracing a Serbian expedition to Mount Everest. Images from another time, shot in the almost alien, mystical landscapes reveal enigmatic characters, perilous circumstances and the suspense of confrontation to the real limits of human capabilities. An adventure film, as rigorous as it is melancholic, based on skilful editing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A99SWHZ44mhSqI8Qph1DVWk0J3k.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108547,"logo_path":null,"name":"Horopter Film Production","origin_country":"RS"},{"id":82871,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmski centar Srbije","origin_country":"RS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"}],"release_date":"2018-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"4 Years in 10 Minutes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
