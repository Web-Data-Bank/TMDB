Luke heads down to South Beach in Miami for a blow-out \"freakfest\" with plenty of women, music, and off-the-hook action. But one of Luke's good friends (Don \"Magic\" Juan) isn't so lucky -- someone has stolen his credit card, and he's determined to get it back and make sure whoever grabbed it pays the price. Along with lots of music and plenty of fine, fine ladies, Luke's Freakfest: Tha Movie also features guest appearances from hip-hop stars Doug E. Fresh, Crazie Bone, Wu Tang Clan, Kurupt, and 3 6 Mafia.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p5Vj3j3KrHcj3Uxbkjw8BcIshnk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Ultmate Player's Ball","title":"Luke's Freakfest: Tha Movie","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
