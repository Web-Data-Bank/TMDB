Then in the village of El Rito the film follows the entire nuptial sequence - from betrothal through the grand celebration - and shows how it incorporates forms of cultural, artistic, and religious expression unique to the region. The beautifully restored Church of San Juan Nepomuceno, with its painted altar screen, retablos, and carved saints; the ritual of the marriage ceremony itself; and finally the entriega, sung to guitar accompaniment and welcoming the couple into the community, are all aspects of the wedding that reveal the essential values of the culture.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gI10OpLcJru6FNTUoDalu47x6Vp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Celebración del Matrimonio","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
