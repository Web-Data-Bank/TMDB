At first, Cate looks gorgeous, but when she sings it's a [masculine] voice. The audience heckles her, and she becomes confrontational. When the music comes back on, she does a seductive dance but her face is evil. For her final act of subversion, she takes off her hair and makeup and walks away. That part was Cate's idea. Fuck the beauty.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dFWcx7JHhQ9miUYmjDeIvv6ynMf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108605,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shirinneshat","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Carnival is Over","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3}
