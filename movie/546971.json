After a time, the gentle movement turns into violent swaying. Shots ring through the air, the buckets are punctured. Slowly the water begins to flow. This is the high point of a ritual that begins deep within the bowels of the mountain. Then trails of water spurt through the air to the thawing slopes and the water begins to gush, nearly causing the well in the valley to overflow.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":108610,"logo_path":null,"name":"Peter Liechti Filmproduktion GmbH","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1987-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tauwetter","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
