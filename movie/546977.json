One day, Bakti, one of the administrational chairpersons of the neighbourhood suggests bringing Watmo to a mental institution in the suburb. Here, Watmo must live by other people's rules; the rules of the institution. Even though the neighbors and the manager of the shelterhouse meant well, we canâ€™t help to see that there are still many things to be done, before we can consider ourselves a compassionate society. Meanwhile, Watmo seems to decide that eventually, heaven is a state of mind.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/odllyBBy2Ds9suaVNwwBCbQl5mo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":54125,"logo_path":null,"name":"ECCO Films Indonesia","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"2008-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heaven for Insanity","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
