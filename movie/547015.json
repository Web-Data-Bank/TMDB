After an opening in which an Indian classical score renders familiar landmarks unfamiliar, the film abandons tourist London to explore Southall, home to one of Britain's largest Indian communities. It's an insightful take on an increasingly multicultural city—at a time when, the commentary tells us, the capital's Indian population numbered some 150,000, with another 300,000 elsewhere in the UK.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xx5YnbldEFtK5NQiSPVDltUoe0k.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"London Me Bharat","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
