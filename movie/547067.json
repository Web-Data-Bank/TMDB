Wait waits. He forsakes a \"career\" in favor of a \"job,\" the execution of which Trecartin calls a \"work performance.\" A careerist like Y-Ready (Veronica Gelbaum) may call the shots, but she is locked in her own endless narcissistic ascent, whereas Wait can retire from his job at anytime, and does, only to come back from vacation marked for containment. A third type of worker, Able (Lizzie Fitch), more fluidly adopts and discards the gestures of job and career, positing herself as a hobbyist who contrives the situations and outcomes she needs to keep her wave going.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kUw6wzLChH3nlrwFNyqYoPrQWUo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ready","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
