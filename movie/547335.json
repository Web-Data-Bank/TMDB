Using first-hand testimonies by people whose lives have either revolved or are still revolving around the consequences of the Basque 'conflict', Teri Ortega takes a close look at Basque Nationalist roots and offers spectators a group of experiences, emotions and stand-points that allow us to glimpse the end of suffering and hopes for peace, freedom and reconciliation. This is the Director's third full-length film about this particular subject in the wake of 'Assassination in February'(2001) and 'Persecuted'(2004).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hKNCm8pPlpxA3imP5xcs38GEvWx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2011-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Al final del túnel","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
