What to do though when merciless Fate (or the human hand) has placed our beloved right to the other side of the tree? No use crying when a decoration wants to achieve something - it must unhook itself. And thus, our snowman Karel sets off with the straw angel Kamil in search of snow-lass Eva. They wander through the Christmas tree overcoming obstacles, and with the help of other distinctive decorations they eventually reach Eva who is being held captive by the evil Balls brothers.","popularity":0.659,"poster_path":"/3YK8vLHZplTeoaHaAOJ9vwWrY0q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117189,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Anima","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":32252,"logo_path":null,"name":"Produkce Radim Procházka","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2017-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Charlie the Snowman’s Christmas Wedding","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
