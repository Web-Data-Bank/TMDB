On the one hand, the Academia band - a strict band with high standards, starring Noa Kirl and the guidance of her aunt Eliana Tidhar. On the other hand, the silent stars starring Yonatan Margi is a charismatic and quiet man who will deal with his older brother Moshe Peretz, who does not want his little brother to enter the Zohar world.  After the Street Fighters meet Idan Raichel, he decides to adopt the band and serve as its main mentor to win the music competition against the Academy. The plot is entangled in love stories, headed by Noa Kearl and Yonatan Margi with distant connections.
