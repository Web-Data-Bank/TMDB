The documentary captures the spirit of the times and shows a country is divided into all sorts of clubs and subcultures. It is a country that, despite all its blessings, lives in fear and moral confusion. But what exactly are we afraid of? A kaleidoscope of scenes confronts the viewer, disconcertingly and sometimes touchingly, with this and other questions and moral issues.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ybKRXnNReG0eP0jjQwI5DXbDnzK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2018-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Voice of Holland","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
