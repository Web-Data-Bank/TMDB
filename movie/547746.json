The street itself bears silent witness to the deferred good life of the laborer. If Germany is “a little America,” as the narrator tells us, could there have been a “German Dream” for the migrant worker? Or is Berlin-Kreuzberg rather the site of an ongoing nightmare filled with the specters of Germany’s past? How do stories of place and of people converge on Naunystrasse? And how does this documentary speak to us today?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":7024,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sender Freies Berlin","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frau Kutzer und andere Bewohner der Naunynstraße","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
