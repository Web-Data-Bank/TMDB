Elsie and the other women did not conform to the stereotype of women in war. They were operating close to the fighting on both the Western Front and in the Balkans. Also, the SWH's were run entirely and predominantly staffed by women. This meant that there were not only women doctors, rare enough in the early twentieth century but like Elsie, women surgeons.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":108774,"logo_path":null,"name":"KQ Movies","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CS","name":"Serbia and Montenegro"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"The Woman with the Torch : Elsie Inglis's War","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
