This quality of living in one place tends to destroy most senses of chronology: thus, along lines-of-thought of growing and shifting physicality, events can seem to be occuring simultaneously (a thot-process 'kin to that of THE DOMAIN OF THE MOMENT), and the memory of such a time IS prompted and sustained by details of living usually overlooked or taken-for-granted (such as Proust's cookie which prompted \"The Remembrance of Things Past\"). Michael McClure's \"Fleas\" and Andrew Noren's \"The Exquisite Corpse I\" were additional sources of inspiration for the making of this work.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wgaNe5ZaScvQl1eMSImh8kR6JWS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sincerity III","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
