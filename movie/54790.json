Max (no emotional sophisticate) becomes obsessed, mostly with Kira, but vaguely with his curious lack of conscience as well. Kira, fighting to win a job she hates and running aimless romantic loops, faces the precarious double challenge of choosing a next step and charting a course back to sanity. Good luck leading with your heart, when your heart is an utter emotional idiot.","popularity":0.682,"poster_path":"/n2xhHCqFQX90KFpNDmO7y5Q1sfn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sorry, Thanks","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":3}
