They tumble, become still, are picked up and thrown again. The scene is projected on two large walls that face each other; the two projections are asynchronous. A malaise sets in with the consciousness of the presence of a mirror against which the dice bounce. The spectators are prey to a monochromatic phantasmagoria where real and virtual images of the die faces in the mirror are confounded, where a wall becomes the mirror of the other. The black dots on the dice faces such as dead heads taunt us with their random apparitions.».
