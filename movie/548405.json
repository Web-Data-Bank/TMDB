Hauled up by the University board after a public fight that goes viral on social media, the girls face disciplinary action which means hours of community work to set a good example. They volunteer at a troubled teenage girls home run by Jijie. Zak and Yaya proceed to carry out their obligatory punishment but realise its not as easy as they think. Can they set aside their mobile phones and prejudices to really be useful to Jijie and the teenage girls or will they make matters worse by being there.
