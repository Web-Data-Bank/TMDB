Based on fragmentary evidence collected - a broken video camera, a wide variety of cuts and bruises and a general idea of what was written in a lost notebook - it explores the intersection between femininity and travel, the manifold perceptions of the other, as well as the use of intimacy and kinship as tools for protection.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/m4R0ZblQAo1D8h2gFVwMNuNOBpP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Leaving","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
