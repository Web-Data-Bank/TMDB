The event marked the promotion's first visit to Russia. The UFC arranged to use half of the venue and used a modified seating configuration for the arena.  While not officially announced, the promotion was initially targeting a heavyweight bout between former UFC Heavyweight Champion Fabr√≠cio Werdum and Aleksei Oleinik to serve as the main event. However, on May 22, Werdum was flagged for a potential USADA doping violation and his status moving forward became unknown. On July 19, the promotion announced that a bout between the 2001 K-1 World Grand Prix winner and former interim title challenger Mark Hunt and Oleinik would serve as the event headliner.","popularity":1.455,"poster_path":"/zNZCd8GOwlkfPZfVK6V2WMOpn2N.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20529,"logo_path":"/5VmtlWl6dbREk3BWjtN7BoW73ot.png","name":"Zuffa","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"UFC Fight Night 136: Hunt vs. Oleinik","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
