Randy, the protagonist, must make the difficult decision faced by many Appalachian youth‑‑whether to stay in the mountains or leave in search of a “better life.”  The film follows Randy as he struggles with his alternatives of working in the coal mines or going off to college. Shot in black and white by filmmakers the same age as those portrayed in the film, In Ya Blood is highly effective as an insider’s look at the decisions faced by many teenagers as they consider their futures.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":108939,"logo_path":null,"name":"Appalshop","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Ya Blood","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
