I imagined Caroline waking up the next morning, recovering from the excesses of the night before, and trying to mix some orange juice in a blender, but being so out of it that she used three cans of gin instead of water to make the concentrate into OJ. Itâ€™s an odd film; runs about 1:30.\" - Wheeler Winston Dixon","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Madagascar, or, Caroline Kennedy's Sinful Life in London","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
