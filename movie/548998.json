Not only has he been framed for kidnapping but there's a malevolent and unrelenting figure on his trail and he is falling in love with his latest passenger, who has a dark secret that completely goes against all of his moral beliefs. Now he must protect the first person he has cared about in over ten years, discover who he is as a man and outrun a mysterious killer who is more akin to a force of nature, with an ever increasing path of human collateral in his wake.","popularity":2.124,"poster_path":"/E29crVJpMkxpDNMVRY7tIFZsZc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109169,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arctic Rabbit Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":89093,"logo_path":"/AeyR5Juomak9PkPqRLYfEk2srxj.png","name":"Benattar/Thomas Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Furthest Witness","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":10}
