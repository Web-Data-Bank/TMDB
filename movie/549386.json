Yet he is driven to the brink by limited contact with the one person he loves more than anyone â€“ his daughter, who lives with her mother. When he starts the legal proceedings to get more time with his child, he enters the Kafkaesque world of a social-services system in meltdown. His fierce, paternal love for his child is both the source of his misery and his greatest joy.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/4Qeze66hqzwT3tI92bb76rSdONY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73364,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dart Film \u0026 Video","origin_country":"RS"},{"id":79271,"logo_path":null,"name":"Spiritus Movens Production","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BA","name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"},{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"},{"iso_3166_1":"ME","name":"Montenegro"},{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"}],"release_date":"2018-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All Alone","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
