The disputed 277 square miles of sea, known as the Gray Zone, were traditionally fished by US lobstermen. But as the Gulf of Maine has warmed faster than nearly any other body of water on the planet, the areaâ€™s previously modest lobster population has surged. As a result, Canadians have begun to assert their sovereignty, warring with the Americans to claim the bounty.","popularity":0.69,"poster_path":"/47DH2fxprknAT159XRinNPIZUzD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109051,"logo_path":null,"name":"As It Happens Creative","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lobster War","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
