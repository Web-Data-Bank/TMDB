After some thought, he decides to sell one of his pictures. He first goes to an art dealer's, only to find that his painting is not wanted, the man directing him instead to a junk dealer. He goes to this merchant, who tells him he may find a demand for his picture in a liquor saloon nearby. Meanwhile a letter-carrier with a special letter which must have the signature of the artist, has called at his quarters and has been directed by the Janitor to the art dealer's store. Panting and out of breath, he reaches the store, but here is sent on to the junk dealer's. Dashing in just as the artist has left, the junk man directs him to the saloon, but the same circumstances attend him there, and he follows the artist to the home of a lady where the artist had gone to dispose of his picture, but finds that he is too late and starts back to the home of the artist once more.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1907-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Une lettre pressée","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
