The movie follows three teens growing up in 1980's New York. Pinky, Mars and Martha all three girls share a common thread of trajedy , pain and abandonment. Gripping in its raw and intimitate protrayal of the girls everyday lives. Girltalk is a must see movie. This is truly one of the rarest forms of the beauty and heartbreaking tale of survival.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/npvtvbcCrhZKsfAgJgXnqRH7iO8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Girltalk","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
