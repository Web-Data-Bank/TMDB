She exposes a future liberated from the military and economic structures that oppress the present, a future in which relations between humans and nonhumans have been transfigured, a future in which the cosmic dimension of an earthly coexistence is interlaced within the texture of the social. Sirenomelia explores questions of the beginning of the universe in relation to the geological ungrounding processes, invisible structures, geo-traumas and deep time. It is a fictional visual meditation about contemporary science and a cross sections of the larger systems of power and the politics of desire. By performing in Sirenomelia herself, Škarnulytė becomes a measure for biosphere, magnetic fields, photons, minerals and gravity waves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yAyUZydbfWZ3XiJcw6PJ4JDjYvN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sirenomelia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
