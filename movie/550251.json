During this time, a messianic prophecy arose in the countryside of an infant warrior that would be born that could overthrow the conquering Tang, heralded by a flying horse. Into this situation we meet a peasant, A Sadal, who we first discover stealing a Buddha statue from temple and stealing food from an old man dying of hunger. We then meet his wife, Sae Onyeo, and the happily married pair soon conceive and bear a child. However, reports of a flying horse abound and the Tang start a campaign to find the infant warrior, with potential consequences for the new parents in addition to the rest of their village.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pFQqzYSCn1LFoRm2zNuD9700ocG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Once Upon a Time","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
