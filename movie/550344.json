He learns that he is the heir to the throne of Translavia and is recalled to accept the Crown, which along with the freedom of the country is threatened by the impostor, Black Prince. During a forbidden outing on the town with his college sidekick, Mickey Daniels, who has been brought along to make a (unintended) bungling Major Domo, David meets the lovely Princess Carmencita who, unknown to David, is to be the wife of the new King. David rejects his crown when told he must marry a girl he doesn't know. Black Prince has no trouble detaining him until David learns that Princess Carmencita is the girl he must marry. Delighted with this prospect, he saves the country, Crown and Princess following a wild and humorous escape from his captors.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":10750,"logo_path":null,"name":"William Berke Productions Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1935-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Adventurous Knights","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
