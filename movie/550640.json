This film experiments with cinematic projections, microbiology architecture and performance, to inquire into the material 'nature’ of our 'being’. A scanning electron microscope was used to capture the interior landscapes of everyday matter. These images merge with skins and walls engaging in a performance of projected light, poetically evoking a dissolution of boundaries between human-nonhuman, subject-object, art-science, matter and spirit.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oVfXngC6kvFQQIYQFzbA1SYoY9P.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tattva","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
