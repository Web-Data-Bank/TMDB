In this a strand of thought, an idea or a story, and related or unrelated material that adds or conflicts is constantly re-presented over the course of the work, to create in the totality of the viewing a synthesis that is somewhat open, mediated but not fixed. The story of Nohi Abassi is a rainforest myth and is told within the hard architecture of the computer processing centre, and the hard and yet fluid architecture of videographic operations that enclose and abstract the image, and confront the implicit slipperiness of the ideology and the relationship of mankind and nature shown within the myth. The story is read by a non-actor, undermining easy acceptance and transparent listening, and yet giving a different type of authenticity to the tale. The tale is read many times from different points, repeating, double tracking. Every aspect of the recording is present.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pk4LFTDaOOWpwNtqsJQyOm4lZqQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nohi Abassi","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
