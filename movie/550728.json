Who are the dancers of this movement ? What are their experiences, their anger, their dreams, their hopes ? How is it that an entire generation – which sees itself as \"burned\" – identifies with the special energy of this youth culture ? What is the source of this unbridled beauty and body language which has moved form the street to the stage, upsetting all the codes of contemporary dance ? A journey of initiation to meet the heroes of this movement and give the floor to all those who normally are not heard except through the distorting prism of the media every time and inner city explodes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u7ykhsr9MWgMGjaQoaVtbLaQQHa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":128,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Faire kiffer les anges","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
