A second strand of the work is formed by an ostensibly unconnected set of ideas and concerns, dealing with the gradual movement of our social system from a democratic, to an oligarchic global system. The gradual abstraction of the staircase into colour fields, text, the actress singing and repeating a dialog sequence to camera, make a shifting montage without narrative connection. There is no metaphor in this work.Itâ€˜s a loose bag of ideas, some connected, others just there as images, to be organized by the viewer, not really an essay, but thoughts on despair.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/g4KkzlhuDKIa3ObzQEvXTygjssy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We live in interesting times","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
