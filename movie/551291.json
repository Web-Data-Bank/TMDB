Their stories are brought vividly to life through actual real-time letters and diaries as they bear witness to one of the worst wartime atrocities in history.","popularity":1.511,"poster_path":"/bDJSN6aFtmiqhVQY659sWEDBbA8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":162571,"logo_path":null,"name":"Talking Drum Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"They chose to stayâ€¦ and paid a price","title":"Scars Of Nanking","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
