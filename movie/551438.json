One day, physically and mentally tired, she decides, a little reluctantly of Jorge, to go a few days of rest to Mar del Plata. As expected, the temptations of summer on the beach do not take long to appear, since Marta will try to seduce different types of heartthrobs. At the same time, her husband, who has been left in Buenos Aires alone, since the children of the marriage have gone to spend the summer in the fifth of some relatives, is also tempted to live a few days of single. Both, each with their own values, must decide whether or not to give in to their own temptations, but unexpected news will suddenly change the plans of each of them.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/fJ2oV5DN0Ou6n25V2imDk3QycNh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":67217,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinematográfica Victoria","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"1978-08-21","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yo también tengo fiaca!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
