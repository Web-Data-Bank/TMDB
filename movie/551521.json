From an X-rated Halloween party hookup to a coming of age story set on the eve of Ted Bundy’s execution; from a documentary about pumpkin carving and misogyny to a supercut about the gendered dangers of the bathtub; from a cursed stand-up comedy set to a woman ( Carrie Coon) trapped inside a Red Lobster commercial; from a John Carpenter homage (featuring a cameo by Carpenter himself) to a sequel to The Eyeslicer’s now infamous Gwilliam, The Eyeslicer Halloween Special is an experience like no other – a deranged, proudly transgressive anthology carving out a bold new space in the Midnight movie genre.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/buDos61fdOOPh6vdY6JaTcDLQeE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":151674,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Eyeslicer","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A dozen spine-tingling segments of avant-garde, surrealist terror...","title":"The Eyeslicer Halloween Special","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
