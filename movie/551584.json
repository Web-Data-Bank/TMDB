Its structure revolves around the depiction of Neli Ružić's site-specific sculpture Before the Dawn and Bogdan Bogdanović's monument Guardian of Freedom, both of which were set around the Klis fortress in different times, left to entropy and social change. The state of these sculptures activates the archaeology of time, invisible and erased history. The intention of the work is to use the mediums of film, narration and image to evoke the entanglement of personal, autobiographical and historical situation, individual and collective memory, as well as the concept of identity as an unstable construct.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sLbVWkX4UN5iOD9lhLtkTlQDEfc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91695,"logo_path":"/92MGv5y76tBACN5zD6lLsa6pdD8.png","name":"Kinematograf","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nowhere","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
