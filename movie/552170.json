When Kathy gets angry she turns silver and becomes stronger than an ox on the juice. This is explained later, kinda.  After a health bar brawl resulting in $37,500 worth of damage (even though said brawl took place in the alleyway), our two heroes run for it. Kathy goes missing and Spider somehow determines that alien trashcans are to blame. It is never explained how he comes to this conclusion. He simply does, and relays this information to us with the same enthusiasm one would use when telling you they had a ham sandwich for lunch. He enlists the help of his military friend, Velasquez, to help find Kathy and fight an army of trashcans.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lyPg98lwCfZHnMvhzdD2IdLELNK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112104,"logo_path":null,"name":"I/21 Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":112105,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shoestring Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trashcans of Terror","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
