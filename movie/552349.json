Legendary stage director Peter Stein succeeds in delivering a lucid production acclaimed in equal measure by the press and public: “a perfect coup de théâtre” (Giornale della musica). A “stellar cast” (La Stampa) contributes to the production’s success under the musical direction of Verdi specialist Zubin Mehta, who leads the orchestra in a “gorgeously colourful performance”, while “the entire ensemble is brilliant in its portrayal of the characters” (Die Presse).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3LD9qV4Dn12hN3CaFgh00HvkF9b.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91763,"logo_path":"/oWVlAaKGnYxakHEV4ss1w11jBwt.png","name":"CMajor","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":79588,"logo_path":null,"name":"Unitel Classica","origin_country":""},{"id":42147,"logo_path":null,"name":"Servus TV","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2015-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":151,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aida","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
