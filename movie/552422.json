Pärnu KEK Construction Company’s Housing Complex “Kuldne Kodu” (“Golden Home”) – the large building designed by Toomas Rein in the 1970s is one of the few examples in Estonia of Modernist architecture and design on such scale and utopian totality. In this single-take film, its influence seems in fact such, that the housing units built in the 2000s that are seen in the other half of the film still bear traces in their design to the Constructivist-inspired aspirations associated with communal living in the early Soviet Union.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eDF7R3Skfoo2D7fmZzHgHIMsTx7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Golden Home","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
