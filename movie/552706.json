Gamer Girl April O'Neil has a sexual fixation on her favorite video game character, Jiz.

Jenna and Ayumi are a match made in heaven, but when Ayumi beats Jenna one too many times at their favorite video game, she must find a way to win Jenna's favor back. When Katrina's boyfriend refuses to divert his attention from his video games to her, Katrina tries her go-to distraction. When that doesn't work either, she pulls out the big guns.
