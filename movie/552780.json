In the constant passage of time, the Zen-like footsteps of the Walker has finally allowed us to see the Pacific Ocean, the open sky, the seagulls, the black sand, an eel catching settlement that arose in the cold winter rain, the twisting branches of the lintou trees, flotsam piled up like mountains, and a newly constructed cement house, which seems to offer a temporary place of rest for the Walker. \"Sand\" premiered together with the opening of the Zhuangwei Dune Visitor Center.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jZvRR9XsCWOE1K31ELlJEWnTmXx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8041,"logo_path":null,"name":"Homegreen Films","origin_country":"TW"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2018-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sand","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
