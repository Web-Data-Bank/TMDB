The family enjoyed rapid success, and their bakery in Jaffa soon became a well-known establishment, drawing crowds from all over the country. This led to the first franchised food chain in Israel – Sammy Bourekas & Sons. Run by patriarch Sammy’s two sons and son-in-law, bakeries selling bourekas popped up all over Israel. Money started to flow, accompanied by an extravagant lifestyle and parties with Israeli high-society: politicians, soccer players, actors and models. But as the rival siblings began to clash, jealousy, honour and greed threatened to tear down the family empire.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lgwnxZPWEylvASPwwZjMR4NDk42.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2018-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Belarusian","iso_639_1":"be","name":"беларуская мова"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The King of Börek","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
