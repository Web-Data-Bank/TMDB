Maria Ewing is Blanche de la Force, an aristocratic novice who flees her convent when it is desecrated, only to return and join her fellow nuns as they are led to their execution. The legendary Régine Crespin, in her final Met appearance, is Madame de Croissy, the prioress whose agonizing death haunts Blanche. Jessye Norman sings Mother Lidoine, the new prioress, and Florence Quivar is the comforting Mother Marie. French maestro Manuel Rosenthal conducts.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/o1P1pa48ZGAyOiik1QL3PmC0lg5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dialogues des Carmélites","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
