Valery Gergiev’s idiomatic and authoritative conducting inspires a superb cast, headed by Plácido Domingo (Ghermann), breathtaking in his portrayal of a man unraveling toward suicide. Galina Gorchakova is Lisa, the woman he loves and destroys, Dmitri Hvorostovsky lends a superb voice and regal bearing to Prince Yeletsky; and Elisabeth Söderström is hair-raising as the old Countess. Olga Borodina is Paulina and Nikolai Putilin is Count Tomsky.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8OgzlkgMMYeziixvcmgnJVvvUNe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":171,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Queen of Spades","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
