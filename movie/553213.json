Photographed in high temperature 'K' light, the images are presented as a staccato animation, a feverishly ticking meter for a narrative told by a self-proclaimed ‘troupe of professional mourners.’ Price similarly revisits a series of photographs taken from hosiery packaging, featuring young women in highly expressive, stylized poses of fear, dread or despair. They are pictured shielding their eyes; apparently from the camera and/or the sun. In K, these women become the film’s central protagonists.","popularity":0.905,"poster_path":"/7ylRABBzZ1BjgRcpuoL9zCmi6jV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"K","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
