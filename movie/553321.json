Their struggles suffocate them, they forget to live. They dislocate them, bring them together and pull them apart. Father and son share simple dreams and a lifetime on the road. Along an unromantic Silk Route they try to make some come true. Searching for a more livable future they break apart. As working class heroes they accept their fate. The film examines the added value of honesty in our actions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pJmC7xurdc4q6Y1SJi4i34KSuhZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51828,"logo_path":null,"name":"Visualantics","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"KG","name":"Kyrgyz Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2018-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kirghiz","iso_639_1":"ky","name":"??????"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We're Going the Same Way","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
