As a result, the characters – Rosina in particular – gain a new degree of realism and break with the usual archetypes. Damiano Michieletto’s giddying production embraces this perpetual motion and carries in its wake the happy couple formed by Lawrence Brownlee and Pretty Yende.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ljlIW3EMUSxA0jkGTCK9psX5Ilp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15355,"logo_path":null,"name":"Opéra National de Paris","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":72233,"logo_path":null,"name":"Grand Théâtre de Genève","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Gioachino Rossini's opera buffa live at the Opéra Bastille, Paris on February 2, 2016","title":"Rossini: Il Barbiere di Siviglia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
