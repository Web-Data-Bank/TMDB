Baroque and carnivalesque, Eliogabalo is not, however, an opera that advocates a return to order. Leonardo García Alarcón, a finder of baroque gems, and Thomas Jolly are careful not to transform Eliogabalo into a sublime icon who would abase virtue. On the contrary, the conductor and young director, who are presenting their first production for the Paris Opera, accept the character’s contradictions and ambiguities","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yAMrFI5zRY1lnQdeSwlCcZdp2kv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15355,"logo_path":null,"name":"Opéra National de Paris","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Francesco Cavalli's opera live at the Palais Garnier, Paris on September 14, 2016","title":"Cavalli: Eliogabalo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
