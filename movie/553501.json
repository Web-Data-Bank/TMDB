Alas, it is Oreste, Iphigénie’s own brother, who appears, having murdered their mother Clytemnestra in order to avenge the death of their father Agamemnon: such is the accursed lineage of the Atrides, condemned for generations to inflict death after death… Will this chain of hereditary bloodletting be perpetuated by Iphigénie? In Krzysztof Warlikowski’s stunning first production for the Paris Opera, the characters in the twilight of their existence are still haunted by their past.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7oxx7uHJBBpdBOTprsjQrLJhyLj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15355,"logo_path":null,"name":"Opéra National de Paris","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Christoph Willibald Gluck's opera live at the Palais Garnier, Paris on December 2nd, 2016","title":"Gluck: Iphigénie en Tauride","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
