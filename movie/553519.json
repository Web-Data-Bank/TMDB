Contagious savagery, cruelty and brutality are exacerbated by the confines of the prison. However, within its concrete walls emerge both tenderness and cruelty at the sight of an injured bird; a multitude of stories and highly personal monologues. With this production, first performed at the Wiener Festwochen in 2007, the Paris Opera pays tribute to Patrice Chéreau.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kMEjGZByXN8gTfjN6IAyYWNDadn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15355,"logo_path":null,"name":"Opéra National de Paris","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Leos Janáček’s opera live at the Opéra Bastille, Paris on November 15th, 2017","title":"From the House of the Dead","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
