Taking up these scenes of Bohemian life, Puccini offers us a heart-breaking love story and some of the most beautiful music in the history of opera in the story of the poet Rodolfo and fragile Mimi. The staging of this new production has been entrusted to Claus Guth who sets the drama in a future devoid of hope in which love and art become the sole means of transcendence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dQfbPkQ5NDiHRrCIf2ntGMVdVJI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15355,"logo_path":null,"name":"Opéra National de Paris","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Giacomo Puccini's opera live at the Opéra Bastille, Paris on December 12th, 2017","title":"Puccini: La Bohème","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
