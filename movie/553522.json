Invariably embroiled in conspiracies, intrigues and quarrels, Cellini is commissioned by the Pope to cast a large sculpture of Perseus. He is loved by Teresa, but she is promised to Fieramosca, an academic artist who has not been favoured with a papal commission. Terry Gilliam’s exuberant production draws the protagonists into a delirious and joyful yet claustrophobic and megalomaniac world: a flaring up of contagious madness.","popularity":0.629,"poster_path":"/2Laj3irQXmd2tG7CgfdMA7lzGqY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72108,"logo_path":null,"name":"De Nederlandse Opera","origin_country":""},{"id":65595,"logo_path":null,"name":"ENO: English National Opera","origin_country":""},{"id":15355,"logo_path":null,"name":"Opéra National de Paris","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Hector Berlioz's opera semiseria live at the Opéra Bastille, Paris on April 12th, 2018","title":"Benvenuto Cellini","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":1}
