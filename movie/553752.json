His childhood was defined by one crucial incident; a boy kills a German soldier in the woods during the Second World War. The story recurs in Armandoâ€™s work in many forms.: an ill-fated event, a victim that becomes a perpetrator, a guilty forest that witnessed everything but remains silent. Was Armando involved in the fateful event or did he invent a tragedy of mythological proportions? Filmmakers Sjors Swierstra and Roelof Jan Minneboo go in search of answers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/h9lQrOylpLPiBdXciYjAm22DUgh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":56958,"logo_path":null,"name":"Memphis Film \u0026 Television","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2018-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Het Voorval - Armando en de mythe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
