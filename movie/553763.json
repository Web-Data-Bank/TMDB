She joins Tarzan in his East Village hippie \"crash pad.\" He organizes a profitable racket, luring suckers from uptown to watch the wild parties that take place in the \"pad.\" He appeals to their sympathy to extract large sums of money for the supposed rehabilitation of the young female participants. The racket is so successful that other operators, including Big Daddy and Butterfly, join in the enterprise. After several months, Sally Mae learns about the racket and goes to live with a businessman she met at one of the parties. Big Daddy, Tarzan and Butterfly seek her out to make sure that she doesn't talk to the police. They abduct her, give her an overdose of heroin and leave her dead in the basement of a Village flop house.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6hPQHGMIDi5xtEN66j3uwdx2RWB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88705,"logo_path":null,"name":"Barry Mahon Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1968-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"If she's bad enough for Satan...she's good enough for me.","title":"Prowl Girls","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
