A family: Ana, the mother, Katarina, Tvrtko and Drazen, her three grown up children, and Tvrtko's girlfriend Natasa. The story begins in the morning when Natasa, after a quarrel with her boyfriend, comes back home, a two-bedroom apartment where her mother and brothers live. This brings a little bit of confusion in the family's everyday schedule. Through many dialogues we get acquainted with the members of the family, their personal problems and frustrations and their interesting and sometimes strained relations with no serious hard feelings, though, their biggest problem being the financial inability to move away and start living on their own.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/o0pXawhAfuUkUUmGxaEmIHLoBmw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20915,"logo_path":"/g0ZgDi0m0RubOnoUFYaHsa8M5To.png","name":"Hrvatska Radiotelevizija","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"}],"release_date":"2005-07-30","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Everything You Know About Me","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
