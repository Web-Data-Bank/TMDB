Eight years ago, he turned up out of nowhere, with no memories except a recurring dream. He is sent tumbling down the proverbial rabbit hole after meeting a man that shares a similar condition and learning that there are more like him, all amnesiacs with extraordinary abilities. He convinces his brother-in-law, private investigator Carl, to help him uncover his true identity before his past can rise up to destroy him and his family.","popularity":3.619,"poster_path":"/zZQt2Wfo2qRFN041qNoqspI38FU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":181061,"logo_path":null,"name":"Double El Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":181062,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sigil Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":134296,"logo_path":null,"name":"Room In The Sky Films","origin_country":""},{"id":134295,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lexicon Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":1093,"logo_path":"/7GreTaRypmbOBoFYoCCRkYH3Wvc.png","name":"Shoreline Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Some things are better left forgotten.","title":"Doe","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":20}
