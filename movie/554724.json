Amidst exotic, fanciful settings and cruel trials to conquer knowledge, amidst musical enchantment and threatening hostile forces, is the final victory of good over evil and love over hate. Singspiel in two acts to a libretto by Emanuel Schikaneder, the Zauberflöte is one of the Salzburg genius’ last masterpieces, which he probably began composing in May 1791, not even six months before his death. The opera had its debut in Vienna on 30 September 1791, conducted by the composer himself and with Schikaneder as Papageno.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eJE5YyOj4lZS6sX4ejRzWyIOnCZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32404,"logo_path":null,"name":"Teatro la Fenice","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2015-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":148,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Magical flute at the Fenice","title":"Mozart: Die Zauberflöte","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
