The young man's dauntingly routine everyday life is interrupted when his mother takes Tomi to town to celebrate his 23rd birthday. Tomi, who makes laconically analytical observations in his mind, is forced by a new situation to face his own feelings and prejudices about the world. Is life just a total misery, or is it not, after all? Perhaps the twisted world straightens out if you look at it from an even more twisted angle.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rMQNyXtG9o5msQsCuwKy61NYtj7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vihainen marsu","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
