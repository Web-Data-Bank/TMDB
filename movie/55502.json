He befriends Emil and Elsa, two children who--unlike adults--see that their new neighbor \"Mr Berd\" is not human but a big bird wearing a suit. The Pelican Man lands a job at the opera and falls in love with a pretty ballerina, looking so much like a bird herself. Troubles start when adults too find out about \"Mr Berd's\" ornithological origin.","popularity":1.294,"poster_path":"/f7H8vfKizc2njuPuqIyzPV8p96K.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":106991,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lumifilm","origin_country":"FI"},{"id":3159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Migma Film","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":2302,"logo_path":"/rPXEdpqwFycAY9ZgrAJXv13qcWW.png","name":"Svenska Filminstitutet","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2004-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pelican Man","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":5}
