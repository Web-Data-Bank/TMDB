To what lengths would any of us go to stave off the inexorable rite of aging, sickness, and finally… death.  The film reveals a noblewoman and her devotees perpetuating their power by preying upon her subjects. For each young victim, the rite of adolescence becomes a rite of death. And for the noblewoman – the COUNTESS BATHORY – the rite of death becomes a rite of adolescence. Roles reversed, through blood sacrifice.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bIttNtYZmOORkXbkQOnDmefq5vO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Exsanguinata","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
