One day, Georges woos her on his yacht \"l'Ibis Bleu\" (The blue ibis), and they forget both the time and little Georges. Denis gets an anonymous note about the situation and he finds the child alone, crying near his mother's empty bed. Élise is then thrown out by her husband. She tries to commit suicide but Pierre stops her in time. Pierre's mother intercedes, but more than anything, it is the child's sorrow which makes the man forgive.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1919-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Blue Ibis","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
