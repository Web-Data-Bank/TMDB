He is a pupil at the Russian language school in Soroca. He really likes to go to school. He looks forward to going to the \"last day of school\" to find out if he is going to be accepted into the third grade. He knows all the streets of Soroca, because, together with his brother, Gena, they wander all day. Soroca - is a small town in the north of the Republic of Moldova. It is known thanks to the medieval fortress, the oldest on the territory of the country, but also thanks to the Roma community, that lives compactly in a neighborhood on a hill from Soroca. The Roma are eccentric here. They built big houses, some of them being replicas of known buildings in the world. Hence the name of the movie The Bolshoi Theatre, referring to the well-known building in Moscow, but also to the theatrical nature of the Roma people.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zswgaG8Jx1dSOUQIjutU5LTkywo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110517,"logo_path":null,"name":"Telefilm Chisinau","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MD","name":"Moldova"}],"release_date":"2018-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Soroca's Bolishoi Theatre","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
