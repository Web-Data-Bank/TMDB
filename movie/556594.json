Filmed in Lviv in 2016-17, it shows a complex picture of the coexistence of diametrically different communities in the same post-Soviet space. The annual rituals associated with the events of World War II, initiated by various political, social and ethnic groups, have the character of a performance and, despite the tragedy of the historical context, often cause a comic effect. The film is a collaboration of the artist Ekaterina Shapiro-Obermair and the historian Alexandra Wachter.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dOPD5qxAfMPCjb0Q73M95g6aG4j.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2018-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"De Fac-To","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
