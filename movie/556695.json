Running on a common-sense platform of America First, a revitalized economy, tax cuts, a reinvigorated foreign policy, and a promise to reestablish American sovereignty with immigration reforms, Donald Trump ignited a dormant passion in the hearts of his supporters, and won the presidency in what was arguably the most significant election campaigns in our nationâ€™s history.  Trump @War is a retelling of that story and a look forward to the high-stakes midterm election in November, which will help cement his legacy, good or bad.","popularity":1.136,"poster_path":"/ff9K2ryNt31WaAgpfM8gkaSRPeY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98076,"logo_path":null,"name":"Victory Film Group","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trump @War","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":5}
