The robbers are willing to kill their own team, to get away. As Jack Regan himself puts it after the first raid in the film: \"I've never seen so many dead people\". Armed with gold-plated Purdey shotguns, they evaded Regan and the Flying Squad for quite some time, before Regan finds encouragement from his Detective Chief Superintendent who was sent down for corruption because Jack wouldn't testify in court for him.","popularity":1.686,"poster_path":"/3cNQxY9P6sF21pUZ1O4WAMLwr8t.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8363,"logo_path":"/2jrr5PsaURZK5WO2aCauc6cZHRr.png","name":"Euston Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1978-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"They're back - tougher than ever!","title":"Sweeney 2","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":8}
