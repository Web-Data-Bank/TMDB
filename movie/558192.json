It was a time when the north hurried to build up the countryside and support the southern battlefield. The movie takes us back to the olden days of peaceful northern villages and women waiting for their men to return from the battlefield. The war robbed the village of healthy strong men leaving behind the women who waited at the water’s edge.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zlI8rMQZkxhadSsI4R8U6jzenNh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Vietnamese","iso_639_1":"vi","name":"Tiếng Việt"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wharf of Widows","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
