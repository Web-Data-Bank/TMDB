Having lost their mother at a young age, Angela and Catalina were raised by their loving father, Andres, a Cuban immigrant who encouraged them to pursue their hopes and dreams. Twenty years later, those dreams remain unfulfilled. Angela, now mother of 12 year old Isabel and married, works in the District Attorney's office, living in the shadow of her uncaring husband Ryan as he campaigns for Congress. Catalina meanwhile runs the family restaurant and tries to remain loyal to her Cuban roots, but her devotion to the struggling business has crippled her dreams of finding the kind of love her parents once shared.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mariposa","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
