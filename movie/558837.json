These three young women are of the same generation. They have to fight against the patriarchal system to find their place and express themselves through their art. They personify all the different shades of a common fight: freedom for women in their country. A pacific fight that they wage in the street, a space largely occupied by men in Tunisia, and that they have chosen to reconquer by the practice of Street Art.","popularity":1.347,"poster_path":"/pCdcMMe4Ww3xiaRV22zhUMgUSqm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-05-08","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les fleurs du bitume","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
