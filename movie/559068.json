These may be silly clichés, but they are the subject of IL TURCO IN ITALIA and the composer plays with them – quite deliberately. He knows that he is putting archetypes of Italian comedy on stage with figures such as the exotic lady-killer Selim, the young woman Fiorilla, who is chained to the stove at home, but adventurous, and her husband Geronio, who is ridiculous because he is much too old – and relishes the ironic exaggeration. Franz Welser-Most conducts the Zurich Opera House Chorus and Orchestra in this performance of Rossini's opera buffa.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aK9kviHjKR43ZgNq9Q3oYTHsBMo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31742,"logo_path":null,"name":"Opernhaus Zurich","origin_country":""},{"id":79568,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arthaus Musik","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2002-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Zurich Opera House","title":"Rossini: Il turco in Italia (Opernhaus Zurich)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
