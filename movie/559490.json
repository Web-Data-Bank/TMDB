To pass time he mows lawns for his mentor, Sam (McCuffrey), a former publishing genius and current pot-smoking dropout from the rat race.

When Eastern inadvertently alerts Sam to Zac's writing potential, she sets into motion a cycle of events that brings an uplifting resolution to all their lives.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fresh Cut Grass","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
