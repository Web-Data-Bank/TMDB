Once outside, she thinks she’s finally free before realizing that she’s in fact prisoner of a love triangle: she wants to be with the famous Torero Escamillo, but she can’t make Don José go away.  Petruska: At Saint-Petersburg’s carnival, three puppets are playing the same role over and over: the unhappy lover Petrushka, the coquette and a Moor. Fed up with this endless part that never goes well for him, Petrushka attacks his rival and flees from the puppets theater.  Carmen Suite, staged by Alberto Alonso, is a one act ballet about a passionate, free-spirited woman caught in a love triangle. Stanislavsky’s Petrushka, choreographed by Edward Clug, encapsulates the story of a puppet that came to life, burdened by the human emotions of love, jealousy, and rage. Both stories envelop the characters which refuse to abide by the rules, to whom even the thought of submission is repulsive.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xFs7Jz2FFfjWizPd38oZbaWsNbi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bolshoi Ballet: Carmen Suite / Petrushka","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
