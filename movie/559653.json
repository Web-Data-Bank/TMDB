He was immediately removed from his family and home and transported under police escort over a thousand kilometres to be confined on an island for the treatment of the disease. For the next ten years, a leprosarium for Aboriginal people became his home. A lush tropical idyll off the north east coast of Australia, Fantome Island was the home to a close knit community of indigenous 'lepers' who made the most of their existence as people living on the fringes of the marginalised. Now as a 73 year old Joe reflects on his indelible Fantome years. His incredible, poignant story offers a profound insight into one of Australia's hidden histories.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zGJcAQiQSSuQHNqaG5pWU4RUH7G.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118683,"logo_path":null,"name":"LCR Filmsound","origin_country":""},{"id":118684,"logo_path":"/pEgvUJBumcIxT1OfGaPH3lXRUbN.png","name":"The Post Lounge","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2011-07-13","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fantome Island","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
