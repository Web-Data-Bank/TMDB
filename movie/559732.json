Oscar, Emmy, Tony, Grammy, they've all had a lot of practice, and the result is a smooth-run, professional-looking program. But, the first show for each was probably a bit chaotic. This is the X-Rated Critics Organization (XRCO)'s first attempt at an awards show for the adult film industry. Chaos doesn't begin to describe it. Held in a showbar in West Hollywood on Valentine's Day, 1985, XRCO awarded fifteen \"Heart-Ons\" to actors, actresses, screenwriters, directors, theatrical films and direct-to-videos, and another three in an all-male category. An additional five Heart-Ons, with categories like \"Lascivious Lesbian\" and \"Orgasmic Oral\" went to participants in specific scenes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aF6kswtx12uyR2hZo6b9X67bwUh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":55606,"logo_path":null,"name":"AVC","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1985-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"...An Evening to Remember","title":"A Night For Legends","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
