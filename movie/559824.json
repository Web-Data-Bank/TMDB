Her younger step-brother, Nathan, (Connor Kennedy) is eating cereal and dressed neatly in his school uniform. When he sees her, he lowers his eyes in disgust and exclaims that she shouldn't be walking around the house like that. She teases him for still wearing his uniform to school, even though he doesn't have to. Nathan storms into the living room and calls his mother. Over the phone, he tells her that Rachel is making fun of him again. When Nathan gets off the phone, he still feels frustrated. He turns to leave when he realizes Rachel has been listening the entire time. \"I make you feel uncomfortable?\"","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/o9aXPEDLnKuou962kiqZFlH9VYy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97187,"logo_path":"/8b3EX6zgcWIBhlAMJjlaX8j35hS.png","name":"Pure Taboo","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mamma's Boy","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
