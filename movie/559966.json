A pictorial decor in constant motion, the piece shows two dancers arranged like musical notes on a score. Half way between a dance and a montage, the show plunges the audience into a world at the crossroads of animation and graphic performance.  Choreography by Benoit Lachambre, with Louise Lecavalier. This crossover, in the form of a game of mirrors, brings together two brilliant artists: the first breaks the codes, the second alternates between volcanic and fragile behaviour. A show that opens up many questions:  “Am I me or you? Are you me? Do you see me as I see you?”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rojGOLt9fbpXDgBbBbGShZkvtuu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Is You Me - Benoît Lachambre","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
