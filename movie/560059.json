Having enjoyed a conventionally successful early career, Klimt's art changed radically in his mid-thirties. He became leader of the Vienna Secession, a group of avant-garde artists who would change the conservative Viennese art scene forever. KlimtÂ¹s own work became increasingly erotic in nature. His deeply sensual portraits of Viennese women still make a powerful impression upon the modern viewer.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rDjkG6slsqnb3arqJytiOcJYJTA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Post-Impressionists: Klimt","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
