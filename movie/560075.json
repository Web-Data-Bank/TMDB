He was one of the founders of the \"PRB\" or Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. He and the other painters in this group were accused of being atheists and societal outcasts. Controversy surrounded many of his paintings, especially \"Girlhood of Mary the Virgin.\" Many of his early works focus on his wife Elizabeth Siddal. His life took a dramatic turn for the worse following her death, an apparent suicide. During his remaining years, Rosetti became a recluse. Because of guilt, sorrow and grief, he had buried a complete collection of his poetry in his wife's coffin. Rosetti later had her body exhumed so he could obtain the poetry collection and have it published. His paintings can now be viewed at the Metropolitan Museum in New York City and at numerous European museums.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tzPoeBh9UuoM73QgwEofjW8VBoT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Romantics & Realists: Rossetti","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
