At the iconic Thanksgiving feast of 1621 no pumpkin pie or cranberry sauce was served, and that event was wiped from the history books for 200 years! In the 19th Century, some southern states thought Thanksgiving was an abolitionist plot and refused to celebrate it.  Thanksgiving didn't become an annual national holiday until World War II! What started as a somber Puritan day of prayer is now about football and food. How did we get there? Join History as we serve up The Real Story of Thanksgiving.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gOHllTnnkzoCDjR7HoU9VLhWXaS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"What really happened on the first Thanksgiving?
