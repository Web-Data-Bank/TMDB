The viewer is witness to the spontaneous activities and conversations of the family's quotidian home life, which is accompanied by Carol Emshwiller's ironic, often poetic commentary. In one sequence of home movies, the children are seen \"growing\" over a span of twenty years. Using the video camera as a kind of psychological mirror, Emshwiller integrates video's intimacy, reflexivity and realism with its \"unreal\" technological manipulations to form what the artist describes as a \"documentary/video art transformation of self-revealing images.\"","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/1Gj3n7SgH1gDHpR3EeVOBM2Tq19.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Family Focus","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
