A self-confirmed nihilist, Kozlov becomes embedded in the morass of international politics when he discovers the prize in store for the loser, which he appears destined to become. Threatening the narrative of the film, a Brechtian blitzkrieg of missives take form through experimental montage, double jump cuts, over edits, and aural asides that crackle with political satire and hard-boiled sarcasm. Combined with Boswell's on location footage, the film's re-contextualized archival images of Miami and Cuba work to create a fictional netherworld reminiscent of the Twilight Zone.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Subversion Agency","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
