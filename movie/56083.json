He receives the divine mission to guide his people to the land of Godah, in a satire on the biblical story of Moses.

Actors Adriana Nunes, Adriano Siri, Jovane Nunes, Victor Leal and Welder Rodrigues take turns in the other roles. The voice of God, which appears in the off-screen, is by Chico Anysio. Following the group's line of satire, “Hermanoteu in the Land of Godah” visits the diversity of the Bible.
