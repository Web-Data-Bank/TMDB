Starving artists who already have a number of films to their names, Czech Lion award-winning films, excellent reviews and have been screened at numerous festivals, but they don't have audiences. Their next collaborative effort - the Director's lifetime dream - is quickly becoming oblivion because he failed to win a grant, which means it won't be made. And so the frustrated Director and his colleagues await their chance among record-holders of curious disciplines such as crawling with a squash racket or collecting four-leaf clovers. How will the collision of these two worlds end? What will the Director's next film be about?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xS0NXe4bwJCNALa0F76Ujnrw09X.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32252,"logo_path":null,"name":"Produkce Radim Procházka","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":33214,"logo_path":null,"name":"i/o post","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2010-08-26","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Greatest Czechs","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":3}
