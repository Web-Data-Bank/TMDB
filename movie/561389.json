It is a paranoid polyphonic apology of a simple act: offering three perspectives of an object that may not exist in a room that cannot exist, while at the mercy of a mistrustful monologue. In other words, a defense of cinema. This project expands ideas introduced in one of Kienitz Wilkinsâ€™ previous films, Indefinite Pitch (2016), and is similarly voice-driven, using an extended monologue to analyze a common and underappreciated commercial product, elevating it to the status of an almost Platonic form.","popularity":0.603,"poster_path":"/siCmVxHjPi4oEX5eRYry0tgsSXI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This Action Lies","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
