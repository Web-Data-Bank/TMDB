The text of the poem, to which verses are added over days, months and years, can cover anything: images, people, memories, landscapes, phrases, ideas, etc. Having that list of “what seems to be but isn’t” ringing in his head, Eduardo Williams’ film Parsi observes in a perpetual movement the spaces and people to create another poem that is caressed, crashes and spins next to No es.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/62icmi2Qn2DDX69oZ57gedXXEry.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"GW","name":"Guinea-Bissau"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2019-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Parsi","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
