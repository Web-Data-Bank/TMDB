Confusion, running, greed, pollution, loneliness, injustice, war. In short, \"there will always be a city in all of us,\" sings Fernando Fernandes in \"Na Espera\", a dub theme that almost requires a slow and urgent pace around a soundsystem. A protest on any street in Kingston.  The video of the author Miguel D'Almeida, with the help of the artist of Crate Records, is the final auction of Pruridades.  The debut album of the musician of Braga counted on the co-production of Razat. According to him, \"a year of debut and memorable\". Pruridades was chosen as one of the 10 best national records.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qnIdnU9rWKNnBvNBc95pX3hJc6O.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2018-01-11","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"PortuguÃªs"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Waiting","title":"Na Espera","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
