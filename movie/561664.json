That's what 24 kids from across the US (some who had never been out of their home town EVER), did for their summer vacation. Led by three amazing teachers, these new age \"emigrants\" trekked through Wyoming and north to Oregon on a once-in-a-lifetime journey that challenged even the toughest in the group. They traded their modern conveniences for long dresses and overalls, loaded their wagons and took off for adventure on the Oregon and California Trails.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Pursuit of a Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
