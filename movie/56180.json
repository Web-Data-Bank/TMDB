They will spend the night there in order to start the repairs the following morning. Everything seems to go on smoothly until Laura hears a sound that comes from outside and gets louder and louder in the upper floor of the house. Wilson goes up to see what is going on while she remains downstairs on her own waiting for her father to come down. The plot is based on a true story that occurred in the 1940s in a small village in Uruguay. La casa muda focuses on the last seventy eight minutes, second by second, as Laura tries to leave the house unharmed and discovers the dark secret it hides.","popularity":5.255,"poster_path":"/lVl4kAIVswaPR2mmgUMQ1seYoj9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6930,"logo_path":"/iIEp4bd0xYYnqMb6sDKmyUaurbl.png","name":"Elle Driver","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":13073,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tokio Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2010-08-25","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Real Fear In Real Time","title":"The Silent House","video":false,"vote_average":5.542,"vote_count":120}
