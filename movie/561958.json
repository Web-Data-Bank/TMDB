Running over two-and-a-half hours, this riotous theatrical spectacle unfolds as a series of episodes that form a loose, fractured narrative. The video comprises parts 2 through 32 of Kelley's multi-faceted project Extracurricular Activity Projective Reconstructions, in which trauma, abuse and repressed memory are refracted through personal and mass-cultural experience. The source material is a series of high school yearbook photographs of \"extracurricular activities,\" specifically those that represent what Kelley has termed \"socially accepted rituals of deviance.\" Kelley then stages video narratives around these found images.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sGrP5NdLEe4x8mMMt6oF5Fe0cGI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":169,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Extracurricular Activity Projective Reconstructions","title":"Day Is Done","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
