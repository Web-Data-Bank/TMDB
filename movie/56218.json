Our tastes may be groomed by the media, but how we feel about how we look brings our self-image into focus. Armed with something more potent than lip gloss - a mouth so shocking and raunchy it should be stamped with a warning - Cho toured America with her manifesto: \"This show is really about how we should feel beautiful,\" says Cho. \"When you feel beautiful, you're going to have more of a willingness to use your voice to speak.\" Shot at the Long Beach Terrace Theater, Cho's latest stand-up concert film, Beautiful, explores the good, bad, and downright ugly in beauty, and the unattractive politicians and marketers who shape our world.","popularity":2.383,"poster_path":"/kui62Ui3LKT8kVPCUjJgSO2ymg4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Margaret Cho: Beautiful","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":7}
