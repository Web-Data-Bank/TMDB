The aim is to break down the usual clich√©d \"image of Vienna\" such as that found in the traditional \"Vienna Film\" by juxtaposing documentary footage, newly shot material and subjective sequences created by various artists. Individual, self-contained sections of the film gain new meaning within the context of historical material. Familiar sites appear estranged when edited together with historical scenes. Other scenes appear like a persiflage or satirical. The film does not incorporate any commentary whatsoever. It is a collage of diverse materials aimed at conveying a distanced image of Vienna to the viewer","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/11H8rPUjJ5QnehwgCGKnQkOBgW8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1977-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ViennaFilm 1896-1976","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
