The downside is that this adds many minutes to the show, but it also helps keep the live event feel on tape.  We get our first taste of a Jim Smallman pre-show spiel – and to show his feelings (at the time), he’s bedecked in a Die Havoc Die t-shirt. Jim leads a “Happy Birthday” chant for the company, which gives way to “we want cake” chants, before the crowd show their respects for the (then) recently-passed Perro Aguayo Jr., Cincinnati Red and Drew McDonald.  Jim then teases the crowd with “something after the interval” – but chants of a raffle are quickly shot down. Those never go well in PROGRESS… nor do falafel raffles, but they do make for an exceedingly good chant.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":186,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"PROGRESS Chapter 18: The Show We Can't Call Progresslemania For Legal Reasons","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
