Michael, in the middle of an existential crisis, leaves to find shelter in the Brazilian culture. While Enrico tries to explain him his vision of a magnificent country invaded by giant events, Marie, his fiancee, reaches him bringing with her more commitments and responsibilities. While learning to become a narrator, Michael progressively abandons his fear of death, and prepares to resist against the Oppressor, becoming the \"Ultimo Cangaceiro\". Brazil, today like in 1571, is a land to conquer, a prize for a war between two society models: estate and multinational promoters on the one side, housing strength and human rights defenders on the other.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pj8Zvm0Ix9wHW7vWoHcw9KBqmXe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lepanto: O Último Cangaceiro","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
