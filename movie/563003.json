Sergeant Archie Jones and his pals find themselves going over the top one last time. All they had to do was wait just one more hour. As eleven o'clock approaches Archie, badly wounded, slips between two worlds.

When all seems lost help is offered from an unexpected hand.","popularity":0.785,"poster_path":"/izzhgfgmyHTi56LhXNxbsrUhApf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113201,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shaking the Tree Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Based on the events on the last day of World War One.","title":"Eleven","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
