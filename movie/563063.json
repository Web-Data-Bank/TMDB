All he has left is a mortgaged house, a mortgaged yacht and a mortgaged wife. Precisely, there is a young vivacious, banker in his spare time, a little sadistic on the edges, ready to take the mortgage in question. Helped by his damned soul, a Turk, brother of his mistress, the builder throws his wife in the arms of the viveur. Which falls madly in love with Thassoula. The Turk kills Giorgian's uncle. Held by blackmail, he realizes that, decidedly, he has gone too far. Too late.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bwGVdo7cLfM7wIgQZqJi4paZDVq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25100,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sport-Films","origin_country":""},{"id":187874,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fanayotopoulos","origin_country":""},{"id":2260,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Marceau","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1965-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The shocking story of the far side of love!... and the men and women with twisted desire who played there!...","title":"The Girl Can't Stop","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
