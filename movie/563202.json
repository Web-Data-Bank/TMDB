The editing image by image allows us to explain the connections that link each image, their contents and their symbols. Like a synthesis, through the prism of Totality, the film shows all these questions and researches about Man and his world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p1xV37NCIDj2UzC0rXo0FOtNrP0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"TOTALITÉ","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
