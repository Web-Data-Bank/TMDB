It is the disturbing wordless story of a woman and a man living in a strange setting where objects are endowed with life that they have chosen to tell us through this theater of shadow puppets in cut out figurines. Their characters will know a tragic fate since carried in the air by balloons, they will finally be devoured by a horrible dragon.","popularity":0.621,"poster_path":"/5HAXVpRw8xFkZwmxBqtJoMUvSpN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98279,"logo_path":null,"name":"Service de la Recherche de l'ORTF","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":24119,"logo_path":"/iNcPopycyTGDgWy6dDl5cnlfS3n.png","name":"Radio-Télévision Française","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1957-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tick Tack","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
