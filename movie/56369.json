But once love is found, it is a matter of spreading it and here the difficulties begin: first the father who opposes it; then, after the death of his father, the gossips who make Marino believe that Marisa was a little good, so much so that Marisa runs away. Repentant, Marino searches in vain and then, almost by accident, finds her again, Mrs. Ciceri. But love admits no obstacles, not even that of a deaf and dumb husband.","popularity":2.734,"poster_path":"/prdvxFuArp5E2dzGuBlwrEbZvJd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1527,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Productions Jacques Roitfeld","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":73,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fida Cinematografica","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1968-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Torture Me But Kill Me with Kisses","video":false,"vote_average":6.853,"vote_count":51}
