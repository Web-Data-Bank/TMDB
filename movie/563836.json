Cereno is in very bad condition and apparently survives only thanks to the affectionate care of his faithful body-servant slave Atimbo. When Delano leaves the dilapidated ship to seek relief, Cereno jumps in the boat and explains to the Americans that he has been the victim of a revolt of the slaves. The ship is now in their hands.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5BwYsHaMoXyMGl6rrzsWMVKdh9t.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Benito Cereno","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
