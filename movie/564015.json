Born during the Civil War, she fought during the Second World War where she survived three concentration camps. After the war, she worked as a pediatrician for 50 years. On the screen, Ida Frank's monologue is an autobiographical tale that speaks of her life, of choice even when there seems to be none. It is a rare blend of sincerity and agreed language, deeply personal, objective and uncompromising. The story of this woman combines the optimism of youth, the spirit, self-deprecation and a fighting character, all forming a powerful agreement.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hrrIdnK1GPjFMj8Es4hXxDn0d4C.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2017-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When The Morning Came","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
