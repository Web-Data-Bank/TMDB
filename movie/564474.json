The iconic “A” stock trains plied the route for over 50 years, firstly in unpainted aluminium finish and later in refurbished blue, red and white Underground colours. Filmed in 1995, here you can see both incarnations of the A stock at work – a tastefully refurbished train running on the main line, with unpainted stock (with the inevitable graffiti) running on the branches.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zQ2B9EiYn94jlf0wDp7FvjJA586.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70985,"logo_path":null,"name":"Video 125","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1995-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Metropolitan Main Line","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
