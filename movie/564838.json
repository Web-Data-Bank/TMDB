Among the complications is his growing regard for the woman who plays his cinematic wife. She may wind up replacing his actual wife in real life. One of the highlights of this film is the insight it gives into the actual mechanics of filmmaking.","popularity":1.011,"poster_path":"/jY9SQO4Y1IP8gexkb6A8Oo8FaFh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1416,"logo_path":null,"name":"Albina Productions S.a.r.l.","origin_country":""},{"id":1293,"logo_path":"/4r2EdENtYK1Ddxmciod3XvmfA9k.png","name":"Office de Radiodiffusion Télévision Française","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1973-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Private Screening","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":5}
