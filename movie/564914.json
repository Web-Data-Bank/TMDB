Pancini, a Staten Island electrician, and others such as Frank Seddio, an Assemblyman in Canarsie, Brooklyn, compete to have the biggest, brightest, most over-the-top Christmas house in New York City. This short documentary shows what motivates these men and what it takes for them to pull it off bigger and flashier every year--despite the sometime objections of angry neighbors.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uSJoDm44ctuOQn2bHqewtG6maLx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Kings of Christmas","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
