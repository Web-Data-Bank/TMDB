He and his mother Dakunta (Wanda Hamidah) want him to go to university, but his father – the leader of a gang of bandits – refuses to allow it. Dapunta decides to go to university no matter what.  His crush Nyimas (Siti Helda) and teacher Damar (Lukman Sardi) help him, motivating him to practice his running so that he can use athletics to enter the university of his choice. However, his classmate Yusuf (Giorgino Abraham) – who has similar running abilities – is also training; he sabotages some of Dapunta's practice sessions. Meanwhile, the headmaster attempts to limit Dapunta's training out of spite for his father.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/n6NlJg4mJ2FfMpTLLgnZwqwLbK7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":43447,"logo_path":null,"name":"Putaar Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"2011-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wind Chaser","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
