While being followed by nebbish journalist Bob (Michael Chow Man-kin) and coping with their own personal issues, the three are being targeted by Andy, a crazed arms-dealer who is seeking vengeance on Charlie for the death of his wife following a particularly ugly FBI raid years previous. Since Charlie's a hard man to find, the villain takes his wrath out on his friends and employees -- especially his three angels.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":44133,"logo_path":null,"name":"Times Production","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1997-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Killing Me Hardly","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
