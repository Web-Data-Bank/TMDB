We met and interviewed a few factory workers there. Most of them are incredibly young, and belong to the so called ‘post-90s generation’ (born later than 1990). This generation, as a result of China’s one child policy, has traditionally been claimed as ‘the little emperors’, spoiled hugely by their parents.

Difficulties, hope, helplessness, or a better future?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wLYdGhUawgWaOnDhKXVycZaDbw4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The 18-Year-Old Assembly Line","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
