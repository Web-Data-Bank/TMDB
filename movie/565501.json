In George Balanchine's The Nutcracker, Tchaikovsky's beloved melodies transport the young and young at heart to a magical world where mischievious mice besiege a battalion of toy soldiers, and an onstage blizzard leads to an enchanted Land of Sweets. Balanchine's stunning choreography shines amidst awe-inspiring set pieces, ornate costumes, and grand one-of-a-kind visual effects, like the one-ton Christmas tree that grows to an astonishing 40 feet. The New York City Ballet's beloved production has been performed in New York City every year since its premiere on February 2, 1954, and is seen live by more than 100,000 people annually.","popularity":0.641,"poster_path":"/rTDGShDKfpBoP6mq6QCtfKuUh8E.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108696,"logo_path":"/gJs5yAYYjJvO2f5RX51vlRL610G.png","name":"Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"George Balanchine's The Nutcracker","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
