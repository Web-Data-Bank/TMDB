In the film, a man watches a monumental concrete sculpture of a man being hoisted out of the sea. The sculpture is clearly reminiscent of a classic heroic monument but in a strange, and somewhat uncanny way, the face and figure of the sculpture look amazingly like the man who’s watching it rise out of the sea.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wfGqHVMz5FzG8404d6XXl57rbeo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GE","name":"Georgia"}],"release_date":"2017-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Winter Which Wasn’t There","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
