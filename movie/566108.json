With each story told, Patrick felt he gained not only a piece of his father but a piece of history, as if becoming a steward of family heirlooms. Yet, when his father started performing secret intelligence for the US government, there were stories he could never tell and hardships that ultimately tore the family apart. Frogman delves into the sacrifices and burdens of a family where keeping secrets became part of the job, and explores just how much we can know someone through the stories we inherit.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sjghcNXT00sSpdH4kdM9PSdPqbQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frogman","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
