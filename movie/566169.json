A man walks toward the shore, looking for something. A bunch of illegal immigrants from northern Africa are hiding in the bushes. The man works for the local mobster exploiting the immigrants. They will work at a local mine as modern slaves. Among them is somebody who is not supposed to be there. Sometimes inner conflicts come to the surface. This is the moment to take a look where nobody does, where modern hypocrisy turns other humans into misfits, and not only people from the third world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"About Next Horizon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
