The little they earn goes into drugs and slot machines. She was raised in Los Angeles and he spent his life in gangs, which left him with a bullet wound in the head that sometimes affects his memory. But all the wounds, the drugs and the gambling cannot help them forget that at one time they were a real family with a child they loved tenderly, until the day the Tijuana authorities took her away. Time goes by and Weraâ€™s love for Topo becomes nothing but a bitter memory that accompanies her in her descent to hell.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/g2rdvDbOvEQDywwmJPg9PcBuO4x.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Topo y Wera","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
