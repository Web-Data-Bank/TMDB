SOYALISM follows the industrial production chain of pork and the related soybean monoculture, from China to Brazil through the United States and Mozambique.\r This eye-opening documentary describes the enormous concentration of power in the hands of these Western and Chinese companies and the impact this is having on the food we consume.Hundreds of thousands of small producers have gone out of business and entire landscapes have been permanently transformed. The system has been exported across the world.\r From waste-lagoons in North Carolina to soybean monoculture in the Amazon rainforest, is this demand for soy bean jeopardizing the environmental balance of the planet?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/x368exfWJDxmvE338BMjnG5QJZ0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112123,"logo_path":null,"name":"Elliot Film","origin_country":""},{"id":112124,"logo_path":null,"name":"Albamada","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2018-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Soyalism","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":3}
