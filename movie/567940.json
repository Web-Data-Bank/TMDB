His average day is spent between the censorship office, his colleagues and his evening writing class. For a writing assignment, he steals a photo from one of the letters, in which appears Selma, an inmate's wife. More than an inspiration, she becomes an obsession for Zakir. He observes her, makes up stories, and imagines the worst to the extent that he puts himself at great risk.","popularity":0.878,"poster_path":"/5hatJuGsPlWTlVdxafdvY7GSwjL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112313,"logo_path":null,"name":"90 Film Production","origin_country":""},{"id":24769,"logo_path":null,"name":"Departures Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":58048,"logo_path":"/66Vk4FFCl61tPs3iBleAX2sTfkv.png","name":"Silex Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"2019-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Passed by Censor","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":9}
