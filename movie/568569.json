When he gets to her place, she has a special surprise in store for him. \"Coleção de Humanos Mortos\" is the second story, and in it a young man is plagued by his inner demons, pushing him to satisfy his desire to inflict pain on others. Finally, in \"06 Tiros, 60ml\" a man wakes up to find himself trapped inside a hospital with blood-soaked faceless monsters and must do what he can to escape, even if that means killing every monster or person he comes across.","popularity":0.812,"poster_path":"/yHY3XqIrwphLBgLciWHzOlxPR0P.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85929,"logo_path":null,"name":"Black Vomit Filmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2006-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"3 Cortes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
