The images are taken from commercials and other commercially released films as well as my own shooting. Sections of frames were cut out and then placed into Super 8 film frames which had been painted upon, a mouth here, a leg there. This film can also be read like a comic strip on the rewinds. The film was blown up to 16mm. Ironically my hope had been to keep the film in Super 8 as a discourse on gauge chauvinism, one of the implications in the title.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nRp9uMjKau2aTXQNRfmn0MCmBG6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1983-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Big Brother","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
