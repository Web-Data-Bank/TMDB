When young Simon Dubé dies in a car accident, the villagers’ tranquil and regulated existence is thrown out of step. People are decidedly reluctant to talk about the accident. Time seems to lose all meaning. Snowy, frosty winter days stretch out into infinity. Mysterious figures emerge from the fog and commit strange acts. But what seems strange is sometimes more familiar than one might suspect.","popularity":3.681,"poster_path":"/aEOM10uq1SkAeFVcSxVShjg9fBH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26283,"logo_path":null,"name":"Couzin Films","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2019-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ghost Town Anthology","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":25}
