An atmosphere of emptiness and hopelessness reigns around them. Young people have no idea for their future, but they do not want to duplicate the pattern of a poor existence according to which their parents live. One of them, Arek, had a chance to break out of this vicious circle for a moment. The possibility of a brilliant career, fame and a lot of money was opening up to him, the Polish Junior Champion in Kickboxing. Serious heart disease shattered these plans. Arek dreams of renting a flat and freeing himself from his alcoholic father. Together with Lalka, Panicz, Mucha and Renata - his closest friends, he often visits the Kosmos pub, owned by the local mafioso Marsel. One day Marsel offers Arek and Mucha a jump: they are to break into the apartment on the top floor of a skyscraper.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ypTMttasXOeYGoGElspgpdkNfrx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pal System","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
