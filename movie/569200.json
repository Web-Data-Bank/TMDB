Like a visual artist using different visual elements, Virgil established personal sketches using the palette of musical expression. EVERBEST VIRGIL perpetuates this tradition by linking the portrait of a composer to his own composition. I filmed Virgil, in his apartment at the Chelsea Hotel, in Manhattan, shortly before his death. These are the last images taken from the life of one of America's most treasured composers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6z7IuiPqoSBnlVBww9nckJFJhZU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-05-20","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Everbest Virgil","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
