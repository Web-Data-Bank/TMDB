On the one hand, the Seine's sparkling, the Alexandre III bridge's sculptures and the majestic stairs descents of a mysterious personage ; on the other hand, the brilliance of a mirror reveals a lascivious inner space, invaded by art works, strange objects, tropical plants, heavy clothes, in the middle of which sit enthroned the Aesthete contemplating male nudes photos. The crystalline voice of a counter-tenor celebrating Bach perfects the voluptuous feeling emerging from this movie.","popularity":0.655,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les métaphores d'Alex","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
