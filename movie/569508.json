How far can you go? How fast? Whatâ€™s it like to go three days without food and companionship? To run 15 miles, to climb a 14,000 foot mountain, to navigate in dense forest or open ocean, to rappel down a vertical cliff, or sleep in the snow? Teenagers find out in Outward Bound Schools throughout the country. The result is a positive sense of self and the natural environment. The film is fast paced with intentional disregard for time and space continuity. The students tell the story.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":100191,"logo_path":null,"name":"Summit Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1970-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Outward Bound","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
