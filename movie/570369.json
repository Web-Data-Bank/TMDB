In a belated attempt to connect with her roots, she rushes to the cemetary and joins a funeral gathering. She gets to know the people at the ceremony and is soon embroiled in an art smuggling scheme and has some (probably incestuous) romantic feelings for a young man she believes may be her brother. Eventually she finds out that she went to the wrong part of the cemetary and that these people are not her kin.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/e8wRq2vY3i1YJgOy6gTGWpoRlAW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pentimento","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
