He's still completely nuts. The chaos he perpetrates around him causes as much violence as he does himself, but nothing stops him in his quest to get to the ocean. Suzanne never was in a hospital for the insane, but perhaps she should have been. The energy that sparks between them leads to yet more mayhem and death, but nothing, nothing at all can prevent Gilbert from seeing the ocean.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les enfants volants","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
