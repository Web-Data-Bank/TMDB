Even today, the inhabitants sometimes hear the cruel laments of the tortured ... but it is especially foreigners, passing through the region, who would have the most to fear ...  Broadcast on TV at the end of 2009 and published on DVD in March 2010, MONOROI is a horrific drama that does not play in the category of many DTVs that abound (pollute?) In Japan. Far from being broke, MONOROI even allows the presence of some actors known in the casting.","popularity":0.623,"poster_path":"/7jYSjAa80qgLyqBXwuvwnMSPZxM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2009-12-26","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Monoroi","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
