When the mine is nationalized, rendering the stock worthless, he considers himself shamelessly robbed by the bank; it seems only fair to him to return the 'favor' and rob the bank, teaming up with the whole family as they were all duped. Even for professionals such an enterprise -he decides to dig a tunnel- is quite demanding, but for simple commoners it's daunting, as they also have their personal downsides; thus Victor's wife has a most unwelcome tendency to blurt out the truth, even to the grumpy local copper: a crazy risk when you need to keep a criminal plan secret.","popularity":4.932,"poster_path":"/r6cGdysyGhJ1ytCb9sLHkEfCUpe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1740,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Copernic","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":22672,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pamec Cinematografica","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1964-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rob the Bank","video":false,"vote_average":6.465,"vote_count":144}
