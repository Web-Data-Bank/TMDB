The show took the artists into the hallowed studios, and with the only audience being the TV cameras and technicians, they recorded a selection of songs later broadcast in the twelve hour-long episodes. Augmented with interviews, the shows cut through the normal visual effects and studio trickery to showcase the music itself.  The 2-disc DVD brings together some of the best performances from the whole series, along with some additional goodies.","popularity":0.674,"poster_path":"/95PiJaGctruBeMAhkaanRT2Mt64.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109183,"logo_path":null,"name":"BCI Eclipse Company, LLC","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2006-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":146,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Up Close and Musical","title":"Live From Abbey Road: Best of Season 1","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
