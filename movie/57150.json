Both musicians have been regulars at Montreux across the years but this was the first time they headlined their own concert together. The show features most of the tracks from their classic 1973 album Love Devotion Surrender mixed in with a wealth of other material. The evening was a showcase of supreme musical virtuosity and spirituality and typified the approach of these two great artists. It is certainly a performance not to be missed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aXoRkioX7BEN4SPEZd3m3iJPVmK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-07","revenue":0,"runtime":181,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Hymns for Peace","title":"Santana & McLaughlin: Invitation to Illumination - Live at Montreux","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":5}
