Thiel’s virtual growth consists of plastic refuse and coral-like formations, and offers a playful yet ominous glimpse of a future where sea levels have risen to dangerous levels and ecosystems are irreversibly contaminated. Over the course of each day visitors experiencing the work stimulate the corals’ growth, but once the number of viewers exceeds a certain threshold the accumulated exposure bleaches the formations and causes them to die off. After a lengthy period of overnight rest, the growths are restored to their original vibrancy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unexpected Growth","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
