A study of colour, stasis, and different modes of multiple-exposure. The film slides from a doctored reality towards fantasy. A large part of the film takes place in one single image that continually changes aspect: the buildings on the square, Place d'Italie, seen from my window from when I used to live in that district in Paris on the eighth floor of a kind of council housing block.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fcJ2SVwusDhjABkXuajON1von0e.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Regard de ma fenêtre","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
