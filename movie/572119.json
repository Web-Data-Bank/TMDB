They filter our water. They are one of our most cost-effective reservoirs for sequestering carbon. They are our foundation for biodiversity. And they are vibrantly alive, teeming with 10,000 pounds of biological life in every acre. Yet in the last 150 years, we’ve lost half of the basic building block that makes soil productive. The societal and environmental costs of soil loss and degradation in the United States alone are now estimated to be as high as $85 billion every single year. Like any relationship, our living soil needs our tenderness. It’s time we changed everything we thought we knew about soil. Let’s make this the century of living soil.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/x0y90tVHt4vaYF2YOMQ5WGOZJ08.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Living Soil","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
