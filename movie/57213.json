It was the first motorbike expedition to cross the infamous Zilov Gap. The route went from London across Europe, western Russia and Siberia to Vladivostok. The team then embarked for Japan and returned to Europe crossing the United States. It took 7 months and they drove 20 000 miles. The members were: Dave Greenhough (organizer), Austin Vince, Charlie Benner, Gerald Vince, Joe MacManus (until Turkey), and Matt Hill (until Turkey and then from Russia). Dave Greenhough had to leave early because of a knee injury, and Matt Hill jumped in again (he had left the expedition in Turkey with Joe MacManus) to finish with the others. Like its predecessor, Terra Circa is a shoestring expedition with rough camping the order of the day and has a cult following amongst adventure motorcyclists.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/g6o9PpyijFWFdfnEKI30QNxPajw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The first motorbike expedition to cross the infamous Zilov Gap.","title":"Terra Circa","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
