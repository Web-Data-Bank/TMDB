The events of the days leading up to the disaster are detailed in this unique film, which uses no narration and no interviews. Instead the story is told solely with reports of journalists covering the story, extensive recordings from the NASA team, and interviews with McAuliffe and others who were part of this one-of-a-kind mission. Using rarely seen images and audio recordings, this show takes viewers behind the scenes of this compelling and historic story in a way never before seen.","popularity":1.306,"poster_path":"/qeyPQNVXeJgRrhbSfwSzhAP0YYj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Challenger Disaster: Lost Tapes","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":5}
