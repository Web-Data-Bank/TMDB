The emancipated and spirited mother of three daughters doesn't think that doing so will be a problem. She and her daughters will split up the route into four parts, and they'll overcome the over 42-kilometer-long challenge as a family relay team. Of course, the fact that neither of them has ever ran even a meter poses no problem.","popularity":1.879,"poster_path":"/lVm20k9Ff0oPoUZFqe3FhxMvtFK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6190,"logo_path":null,"name":"Infinity","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":7976,"logo_path":null,"name":"CinemArt","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2019-01-31","revenue":9131085,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Women on the Run","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":21}
