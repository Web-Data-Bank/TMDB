When Mammy is about to discover him, he hands it off to Jerry; this lets him be a hero to Mammy and still get his chicken. Jerry is miffed, and sees his chance to retaliate: Spike is very possessive of his bone. Jerry keeps stealing the bone and planting it on Tom. Finally, Jerry bores a hole in the bone, inserts a bolt, and gets Tom to swallow a magnet. The bone keeps coming back to Tom, even through a fence. Finally, as Tom runs off followed by Spike, Jerry, who's been hiding in a tin can, is also dragged along.","popularity":1.696,"poster_path":"/pxv2X0atQFHvajT2CEbuts91Afi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/5Va1Ie5c4sjfEYqixQ3L8qg7fKu.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"},{"id":89238,"logo_path":null,"name":"MGM Cartoon Studio","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1950-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Framed Cat","video":false,"vote_average":6.862,"vote_count":29}
