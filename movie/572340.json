In Argentina we know little about this country and their culture, we usually think of them as completely different society, and yet we dont even know they have their own Tango. In my journeys through that beautiful land I found that link we share, and decided to explore it, to go and unravel the mistery behind the Finnish Tango not only as a musical or dance expression but also to find meaning of this music for this beautiful country in which I found myself interviewing musicians such as MA Numinem and Susana Rinaldi to tango lovers like Elina Lajunen who has the music in her blood, having travelled to Argentina to continue his studies of this dance, and after all this I found that despite of distance between our two contries we are more than kindred spirits.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uwFtMos75gylndAiWQVHL4NP1Qi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":67493,"logo_path":null,"name":"Insomnia Films","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2016-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tango Suomi","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
