The music in Night and Day by Gianni Castaglioni is in the repetitive rhythm of the images, usually very rapid (with some suddenly slowed down, figements, yet with a fiery intensity). And as each shot, (brief like those of Mekas or Brakhage), moves,; as the camera moves to the nervous rhythm of a wrist, the music becomes a sort of Free Jazz — and not only visually, since the soundtrack is composed of piano frenzies à la Elton John. The extreme close-ups that sprinkle this sort of intimate journal and which are among the most admirable - as well as the most rapid - ever made in cinema, don’t float adrift like the film’s music through a hundred flowing veins.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xhq0CmMepDrevoJfhQV9WBJTQ0p.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1976-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Nott'e'l giorno","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
