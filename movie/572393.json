In Chittagong, Bangladesh, Paul finds himself without a crew, without papers and without a future. He takes the train to Dhaka, the capital, and meets Moti and her mother Alima. By instinct or by fascination, Paul follows them to the village of Rulipara, built on a strip of land protected from the Jamuna River by dykes. While the monsoon rages, and the Jamuna destroys the houses of Rulipara, condemning the population to a new exile, Alima and Paul engage in a desperate struggle to live their love without hindrance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/k2bi20nfkZYmWJZXNk0NrENhdcH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chittagong: The Last Stopover","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
