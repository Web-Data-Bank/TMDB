The house is historic and apparently haunted; at least, Sarah is disturbed during the night by a woman's crying but initially supposes someone else has double-booked. But next morning there is no sign of her. Tom, meanwhile, is haunted by his memories from a year before. Eventually, they both leave for an empty flat on the coast nearby, where Tom's relationship ended. Sarah begins to fall for Tom, but Tom has now - belatedly - fallen for his ex, and finally makes up for his fatal infidelity with her.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Still Falling","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
