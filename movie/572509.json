Years later, she’s in a close relationship with her new partner, Gabriel. At the Long Term Care Center where she works as an orderly, she befriends Jeanne, an erudite and funny woman, dealing with an important physical handicap.  Mixing realism and worrying strangeness, The Laugh presents a humane exploration of the survivor’s syndrome, the grieving process, the distance of time, the power of love, and the joy of being alive.","popularity":1.041,"poster_path":"/3FQNDjU24TrjDIu2rJGaenKZEJn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16039,"logo_path":"/8vVMTmyjT5tRgiVeptu5cvjVc8Y.png","name":"La Boîte à Fanny","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2020-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Laughter","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":7}
