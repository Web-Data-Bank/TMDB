On board is a professor who daydreams a conversation with a love that never was, a family of Albanian refugees who switch trains and steal a ticket, three brash Scottish soccer fans en route to a match, and a complaining widow traveling to a memorial service for her late husband who's accompanied by a community-service volunteer who's assisting her. Interactions among these Europeans turn on class and nationalism, courtesy and rudeness, and opportunities for kindness.","popularity":2.024,"poster_path":"/gVH7dt0cDoeKm9Q4bF53Jg7Y3o0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2441,"logo_path":"/7Vutdea75apwXkRyfQ4Ne6j0KcN.png","name":"Fandango","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":6246,"logo_path":"/7X6pfxldTiOD7MLo2EQqUQlmOUw.png","name":"Medusa Film","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":12695,"logo_path":"/pZg9WqHoiUqhCzoMwGTcPI6Bs3d.png","name":"Sixteen Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2005-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Albanian","iso_639_1":"sq","name":"shqip"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tickets","video":false,"vote_average":6.603,"vote_count":38}
