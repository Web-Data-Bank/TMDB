Rather than focusing on the alleged objectivity of facts, the film gives space to a chorus of voices that narrate those events in first person, visually supported by archival footage of the period, drawn from the most varied sources - institutional, public, militant and private. Anita, Teresa and Valentina come from different Italian regions and different social backgrounds, but share the same feelings: they no longer feel as part of a society based on the patriarchal family, on the power of \"husbands\" and on the supremacy of males, which requires them to be efficient mothers, obedient wives and virtuous daughters.","popularity":1.123,"poster_path":"/2LZE1dt0ljZOeNZ2TcggNoYaDHb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Want Roses Too","video":false,"vote_average":6.719,"vote_count":16}
