The screenplay is based on a work by Fricis Dziesma published in 1948, on the tradition of grain threshing in the Kurzeme region. Alongside the human lives, there are also the joys and woes of the little animals, and the lively whirl of intertwining events carries the viewer into the distant past, perhaps recognizing the fond memories shared by their parents or grandparents.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9RwTiQr9riYmsAMMUBodje2Sdkr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82672,"logo_path":null,"name":"Animācijas Brigāde","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2004-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Poēm pa kulšen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
