His last will and testament insists that the three get together on a road trip to plant a cross where he died and also to try and get along. His twin brother had for years distanced himself from them because he did not approve of his brother's cabaret lifestyle and the friends he kept. They set off on a road trip through Southern Africa to perform tasks laid down in the will in order to inherit from the estate. They also have to do one final task of performing as a trio, the 'Manginas' for one last show with the twin brother taking his brothers part as a drag artist.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qeQ6v7pNG7RkEnLBWiSYNISSpYZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Afrikaans","iso_639_1":"af","name":"Afrikaans"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Not just another fairy tale...","title":"Once Upon a Road Trip","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
