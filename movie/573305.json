Forced to confront the cracks in their relationship they slowly descend into a bitter web of jealousy, petty recriminations and violence. Starring Alice Lowe (of 'Sightseers' and 'Sherlock' fame) and picked to premiere at the 2013 London Film Festival, The Field is written and directed by Andy Orr & Matt Jones. It is a blackly comic look at the kind of long term relationships that seem to exist in a strange limbo of break up and make up, of domesticated desire and unfulfilled promise. In short - an unromantic comedy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Field","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
