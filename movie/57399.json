It is a dance about feelings, which always pose a big challenge – particularly for young people.  Teenagers from more than eleven schools in Wuppertal went on an emotional journey that lasted almost a year. Every Saturday, forty students aged between fourteen and eighteen years of age took part in rehearsals that were led by Bausch-dancers Jo-Ann Endicott and Bénédicte Billiet and intensely supervised by Pina Bausch herself.","popularity":0.756,"poster_path":"/bHiCN8Ea29CoH9ZH7lwtiLtSLod.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1410,"logo_path":null,"name":"TAG/TRAUM Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2010-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dancing Dreams","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":13}
