Having escaped from her problems from Italy to Russia, she does not find peace here either. Boredom and misunderstanding of others torment her, and the inner fire of contradictions tears to pieces. She has a difficult relationship with her father, she wants to return his love and attention. They are loved and recognized in their small orchestra, however, no one supports and does not understand her impulses to bring something new, to overcome a boring routine and finally change the world of music. It’s getting harder every day to achieve Angela’s inner harmony, or as Angie calls her. The world is full of cruelty, contention and misunderstanding, and finding a place in it for a bright and kind person who cannot feel lies and betrayal with his warm heart is very difficult, almost impossible.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8vLegjlbxFhssgexLvzclBgXz75.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113343,"logo_path":null,"name":"Yunna Film","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2018-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pink Or Bell","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":1}
