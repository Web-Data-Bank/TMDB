He invited \"subjects\" into his living room to strip down and reveal themselves physically and emotionally through personal stories about their relationship to their penises. Fender interviewed a vast cross-section of anonymous, naked men about their prized appendage: from monks to transsexuals to ex-marines to designers, ranging in age from 21 to 80. Hoping to demystify, illuminate, and even celebrate this \"member\" in our society, this DIY documentary is a candid exploration of what it means to have a dick.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nSpO59rjtJlNIpzlSDd10ipde8A.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dick: The Documentary","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":4}
