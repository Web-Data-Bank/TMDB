The Texas powerhouse promotion had no equal in the Lone Star State, and its might yielded both prosperity and controversy. The territory saw gates that crushed those of the other Texas promotions. It was center stage for the Funk/Brisco family feud, hosting the switch of the NWA title to Jack Brisco.  Join Bruce Prichard and Jim Cornette as they dissect everything possible about the classic territory.  Bruce was a young acolyte, cutting his teeth in the territory and his closeness to Boesch and the entire operation put him front and center for much of what is discussed.
