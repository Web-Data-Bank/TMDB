The match was 27-seconds. But Lord, the road to that decision was no-where near as short. Political wrangling's with McMahon and Savage would cause this swift end to a historic reign. THE OPPONENT: It may have been The Ultimate Warrior in the ring that night at the inaugural Summerslam but Honkyâ€™s real opponents were, in actuality, all outside of the ring. THE ANGLE: Was it Savage? Jake Roberts? Beefcake? Warrior? Just what was the driving angle that led up to Summerslam? We will iron it all out here. THE SHOT: Head back to NYC for the first Summerslam and the fascinating and heartbreaking journey that got HTM there!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cd9BmX5iN0DOOQs5LLnAcD1qvao.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":122,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Supercard: Summerslam 88 with The Honky Tonk Man","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
