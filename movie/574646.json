Nevertheless, his short life was enough for his work to influence social and cultural spheres in Slovakia. First of all, however, he was a bohemian and a rebel able to see beyond his generation’s field of vision. He lived a life of an impalpable hothead floundering in loves, desires and passions. At the same time, as an author, his reasoning and views were precious and clear.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vF5xayA5Gfatb8uiHhkv4iKCpgH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37158,"logo_path":null,"name":"Furia Film","origin_country":"SK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SK","name":"Slovakia"}],"release_date":"2011-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Documentary road-movie about a poet, lyricist and kook Jožo Urban.","title":"Little Mad Robinson","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
