They have to deal with issues such as responsibility, renunciation and loss much earlier than their peers. Their reality is fundamentally different from that of other children and adolescents. Quietly observing and with great respect for all family members, the film approaches the different life realities of such siblings and depicts their everyday lives.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iZJJXw8Erw1C87LNPvO6RUJUjEr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53572,"logo_path":null,"name":"mindjazz pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":95103,"logo_path":"/idMgGszIoYEe4LGQDe7byniayWZ.png","name":"Kinescope Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":113449,"logo_path":null,"name":"Soundbase Studios GmbH","origin_country":""},{"id":45198,"logo_path":"/9z46Z8Px88a30wkr7G0QUDbbtt2.png","name":"Deutscher Filmf√∂rderfonds","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":2661,"logo_path":"/lL2swFUxvaFlT1BSheo9LTClJo1.png","name":"nordmedia","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unzertrennlich","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4}
