Laurie Anderson's tone is less outraged than elegiac, mourning for lives lost, ideals misplaced. The music is dramatically stripped down to a handful of players, centered around Anderson's haunting violin and voice, frequent Bill Frisell band-mate Eyvind Kang's viola and Peter Scherer's keyboards.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eztZKHWpkRWqdknUqho8hQYQOzE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A concert poem","title":"Homeland: The Story of the Lark","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
