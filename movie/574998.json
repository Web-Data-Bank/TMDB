Ruth removes the tube and as the searing pain subsides, her memory begins to return. She looks out of the window and sees hundreds of identical ships orbiting a green planet. Ruth remembers the pledge she made to begin a new life, light years away from the earth. Suddenly there's a noise from the other side of a dividing screen and Ruth realises that she's not alone.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/o0WegWyvfkkPs8xuxh4ozzZeLWD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113471,"logo_path":null,"name":"Long Arm Films","origin_country":""},{"id":12177,"logo_path":"/9P2VDiqTAr9qupVBbgCpf6FhLhn.png","name":"Ffilm Cymru Wales","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":7281,"logo_path":"/lkqIuaKTm2sg3umwTBScmqyzLX5.png","name":"BFI","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":87836,"logo_path":null,"name":"Edicis","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zero Sum","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
