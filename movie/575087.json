Gérard and his student Laurent Abou-Haidar discuss the issues they confront as artists in their pursuit of their craft in drawing and the elusive ideas of success, time and the worth of their efforts. Gérard also demonstrates in a lesson his approach to seeing the perspective of a model/subject in space and drawing what he sees at the easel. Along with having an art lesson woven through the documentary, Art Lesson in Fécamp is in itself a lesson in art and an Artist’s life that goes with it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eYrBXmtA3gQDdVt2t4akZrbX298.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Art Lesson in Fécamp with Gerard Vilage","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
