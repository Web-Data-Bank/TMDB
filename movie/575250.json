A true declaration of love to the city of New-York, Wonderful Town tells the tale, with a boisterous rhythm and vast amounts of jazzy tunes, of two sisters from Ohio looking for success and glory in the big city. Lighter in tone than later works like West Side Story or Candide, its smart combination of the different musical traditions one could hear when wandering in the streets of New-York, its accomplished orchestral writing and colouring, and its vivid sense of comedy earned it no less than five Tony awards when it premiered in 1953.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6sN9hbl58osMkWonbwQGcKoUtTL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109153,"logo_path":null,"name":"BelAir Classiques","origin_country":""},{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/eLvjHPYZ12GR58lrDgg6MXZp2a3.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":122,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wonderful Town","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
