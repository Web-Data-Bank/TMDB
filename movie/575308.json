In Paris, she divides her time between an opera house, where she is the dresser for a great Swedish singer, and amateur theater. David, her director, pushes her to her limits: she cannot refuse, so stubbornly, to live and love again. Little by little, Sophie lets herself be disturbed by her speech, and moved by the amorous games and the sensual atmosphere of the opera on which she is working, \"Le Chevalier a la rose\" by Richard Strauss. After each performance, Sophie sees a silent young man, Valentin. She is convinced that he is coming for the beautiful singer. But one day, he speaks to her, and Sophie finally becomes an actress of her own story.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oKqqcHoGC0qKfLw1rvz6kn90Yy6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'étrangère","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
