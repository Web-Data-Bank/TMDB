The results were far from great, but I came across the old, ever ageing tape of the film and decided to convert the project to digital to preserve it.  The films features one of my very few staring roles, and also features many of my friends from youth namely David Mills and Jennifer Cooper.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fjOWG0G265ZxagFed4uGmPamKJk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113534,"logo_path":null,"name":"Flapping Head Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1999-12-20","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Once Bitten","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
