Two obsolete apparitions: Super 8mm film stock, Kodachrome K40, exposed 30 years past its expiry date â€“ and the far-right National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD).  A short film on the human tendency to find patterns in noise. A film on conspiracy theory, on the state of the left, and on how ideology is transported through the selection of seemingly neutral facts.
