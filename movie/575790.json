Together with the director Dominik Wessely, the film comes closer to Mario Adorf as a person and highlights important stations of his private life and his international career. When Mario Adorf begins to talk about his life, over 60 years of theatre and film history come to life. A dialogue with him is not only a retrospective, but also an intensive exchange of ideas about film and theatre and his view of the world, love and ageing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/c8sI1CHR52AmQDxkusxyMB8X1hc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31138,"logo_path":"/aI6mMcZgLUSxlssAtBbE6mRaR7x.png","name":"Coin Film","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It Could Have Been Worse - Mario Adorf","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
