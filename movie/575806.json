Immersed in her family life, Naoko now has a husband and daughter; Aki, on the other hand, remains single and is on leave from work due to a personal crisis. The plot might sound familiar but it has never been told like this. The director Kusano Natsuka stages the interactions through an actors’ table-read and, as the lines are repeated, the scenes gradually develop into on-location conversations. Moreover, she repositions the dramatic peak of the story to the beginning: Aki has murdered Naoko’s daughter.","popularity":1.79,"poster_path":"/hb9ZPkiuB1efzlalpWBVo003aU2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1239,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aichi Arts Center","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2019-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Domains","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":10}
