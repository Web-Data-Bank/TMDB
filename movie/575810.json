And forward, to the time they have left. On the one hand, there is regret – on the other, satisfaction. In a way, they are looking forward to the future – but at the same time, a longing for death regularly arises. And who is actually behind the camera? Are we watching actors or real people? Is there really any difference? Garten is full of contradictions – it is not until the credits roll that we realise who these people from very different backgrounds are.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2q1kJU9Ts5LCGmFsZIyfR265shx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32684,"logo_path":null,"name":"Peter Schreiner Filmproduktion (echt.zeit.film)","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2019-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":136,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Garden","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
