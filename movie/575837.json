In his unfinished film, he was telling the destinies of the victims of the Greek crisis. The list of victims of the crisis has only grown longer, this destitution echoing another that Théo had sensed was coming: that of the massive arrival of refugees who find themselves trapped in Greece by the closure of the borders. Yet citizen resistance is being organized and fights every day to bring those in danger of obliteration out of the shadows. Ironically, the ambulance supposed to come to his rescue broke down because budgetary restrictions had made it impossible to maintain the vehicle. The crisis itself killed Théo. This is a letter addressed to him in the form of a film.","popularity":0.851,"poster_path":"/c8tXWbZvVVqi2troP3YnDnKqE64.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115073,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blonde","origin_country":"GR"},{"id":20482,"logo_path":"/ncZtCy1XzmVeN674GNBDdvMc8b0.png","name":"Iota Production","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2019-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Letter to Theo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
