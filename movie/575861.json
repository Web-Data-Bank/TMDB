This true storyteller was born in India in the 1920s, fled to Pakistan, joined the army there and came to the US in the 1980s. He now lives in a cold, snowy city and is a well-known eccentric in the pool halls. The film tries to map out the radical changes in consciousness that the world has gone through in one human life. Shots of Wahid in his everyday life are juxtaposed with footage in which he tells the camera about his past.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mWY7der4CYKcLAZwZchfgeDPo07.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Minor History","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
