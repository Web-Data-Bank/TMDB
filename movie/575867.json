By a late journey. The narrator tells how the eruption of the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjalla stopped the plane he should have taken for Prague in 2010 from taking off. Meditating on the powerful images of the “Earth’s anger”, Kleinjan remembered another flight that never arrived: the aircraft crashed in northern Czechoslovakia in 1972, before reaching Belgrade. Only a Serbian stewardess miraculously survived the crash. She was included in the Guinness Book of Records and got to meet the Beatles, when John Lennon was considered like “Lenin” by the young Czech anti-communists.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dY082sX73JiPfrD4WBX3p9reFx4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2019-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Above Us Only Sky","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
