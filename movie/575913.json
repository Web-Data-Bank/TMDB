It tells the story of a boy and girl who meet out in the middle of nowhere. As he looks upon the young girl's face he imagines what life with her might be like. His imagination runs wild as he thinks of the blissful episodes such as marriage would bring, as well as the entrapment he could suffer. At film's end he makes his decision. Use of the negative image for one sequence is extremely effective.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1GOcyg32AUi31qRHHqgRc56fjAt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1966-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stillborn","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
