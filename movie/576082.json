We begin in the present as an unseen narrator recounts the assassination of his lover's disapproving mother, accompanied by hauntingly vacant images of urban alienation and garish city lights; we then flash back to witness the first encounter between the lovers-turned-accomplices, their mutual attraction and world-weariness emerging across a sleepless night and morning after. Çevik imbues the proceedings with a stylistic confidence and willingness to bend the conventions of cinematic form to arrive at a complex, gripping double meditation on love and death.","popularity":0.849,"poster_path":"/pheXEk1WNY7Azcy5bfPSDngFZ2M.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117476,"logo_path":"/z6SDo6pyihSidWEaoSYXCse95Fd.png","name":"Fol Film","origin_country":"TR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"2019-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Belonging","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":13}
