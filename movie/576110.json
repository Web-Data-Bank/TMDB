The 30-second portraits were about portraiture and the idea of a person staring at the viewer (as the viewer stares at the TV screen). Conceived of as a \"micro-series,\" the work features 42 30-second portraits of television viewers in their living rooms. The portraits appear very formally composed, with attention paid to composition, lighting, and color. The viewers sit quietly, only occasionally making a slight shift in position. No external sound score has been added, so that the only sounds heard are sync sounds that have been heightened. These sounds include viewers' clothing when they move, swallowing, and background noises, such as traffic outside the viewer's home or a dog barking in the distance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fkNGz322xjNkM8Dp1PnWTqeyzfv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reverse Television - Portraits of Viewers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
