Celebrated choreographer Crystal Pite and dance filmmakers Marlene Millar & Philip Szporer commemorate the fading legacies of WWI, while also creating a moving homage to Pite’s mentors and contemporaries, whose lives and short careers are pitted against the fleeting nature of the dance art form. Featuring Theodore Ushev’s haunting and distinct artwork, the film explores the themes of conflict, loss, and rescue we all experience as we cycle through states of love and war.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/40aTC6C6WwMQygT5nVqZti1CZKE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-18","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lost Action: Trace","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
