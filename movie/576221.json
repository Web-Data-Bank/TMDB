Scenes from the waking memory of the artist seem to have enlivened dreams from a bygone era.  Coming from the family ateliers of the master painter Nainsukh of Guler, this journal of dreams is interesting not only for its ethnographical documentation but also for the excellent artistic qualities of the illustrations, underlined delightfully with sound and rhythm by the director Amit Dutta.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vn6PffdpftktuW5Yf57mc3u8SEU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2019-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Drawn from Dreams","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
