Some say Raven, some say Kevin Sullivan, and some say Jake Roberts. For the first time ever, RF Video locked these three brilliant minds in 1 room and picked their brains.  All three of these men are experts in what most call wrestling psychology. Did you ever wonder why some angles worked and some didn’t? These three guys break down some of wrestling’s greatest angles and matches and tell us why some worked and some bombed. This is a great lesson for every wrestling fan to hear in wrestling psychology.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"RFVideo Face Off Vol. 6: See, Hear, Speak No Evil","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
