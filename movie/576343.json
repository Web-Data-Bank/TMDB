Well on 9-11-10 we raised the bar as we conducted the most emotional and what will go down as the most controversial interview of all time in the history  of the business.  Kevin Nash and Sean Waltman gave RF VIDEO the greatest interview of all time and that is a shoot!  In the past we have hyped up our interviews but this interview was unlike anything we have ever shot before.  I really donâ€™t know where to even begin at but the mood for this interview was intense.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"RFVideo Face Off Vol. 12: Friends 4 Life","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
