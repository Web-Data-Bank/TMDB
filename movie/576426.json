From working with Oscar-winning actors and making films with US$60million budgets to having actors publicly disparage him and online petitions demanding he stop making films, Boll continued to work; he has a filmography of 32 features, a career that has led to his new life as a successful high-end restauranteur. Already a cult legend, he will be remembered forever in the film world; for some, as a modern-day Ed Wood, who made films so bad, they're good, while for others, a prolific filmmaker who came from a small town in Germany and never compromised his integrity while forging his own unique Hollywood trajectory.","popularity":2.818,"poster_path":"/8cwvKVNupuWIzCQcQxImdVcqjzr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":67052,"logo_path":null,"name":"Prairie Coast Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Behind the lens with the most hated man in Hollywood.","title":"Fuck You All: The Uwe Boll Story","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":7}
