In his mind he’s the next Woodward (but he’s probably more of a Bernstein). A year in, he realizes that maybe the paper business is no longer what he’d seen in the movies. Instead of investigative journalism, he is writing easily consumable Top 10 Lists - Best Hot Dogs in the City! Ten Ways to Tell You Grew Up in the 90s! After the paper is hit with another round of layoffs, Bram stumbles upon a potentially explosive story involving the city’s controversial mayor. But he needs to beat the mayor’s smooth talking aide, Kamal, to the punch. This could be Bram’s big break — if he had any idea how to be a real journalist.","popularity":4.816,"poster_path":"/3KZ0cLrMqhugLBRSSmEmk3RN3Aa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109057,"logo_path":"/tgKgEPgNaYqxbZ8oL7gyGaqXC2t.png","name":"CounterNarrative Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":50084,"logo_path":"/7UKMTZt7xLOMYvj3AIM6diZo4Rq.png","name":"JoBro Productions","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":21882,"logo_path":null,"name":"Manis Film","origin_country":""},{"id":111338,"logo_path":null,"name":"Raised by Wolves","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2020-03-06","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Run This Town","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":14}
