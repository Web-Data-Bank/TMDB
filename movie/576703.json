Worth, Texas soon becomes much more than they bargained for. Frustrated by the rising consumer-driven culture, out-of-work pals Douglass St. Clair Smith and Steve Wilcox decide to turn their conservative southern ideology on its head and invent a new religion all their own. Spurred on by the overreach of religion and zealous televangelists of the day, the pair concoct religious monikers (Reverend Ivan Stang and Dr. Philo Drummond), a newly minted prophet (J.R. \"Bob\" Dobbs), and devise a crusade to expose the conspiracy of normalcy by using humor as the ultimate weapon.","popularity":1.464,"poster_path":"/oZ83hw0ZilSTMzQuIblOmOEW9Vx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"J.R. “Bob” Dobbs and The Church of the SubGenius","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
