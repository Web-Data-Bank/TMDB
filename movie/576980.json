Directed by the son of late patient safety pioneer, Dr. John M. Eisenberg, To Err Is Human is an in-depth documentary about this silent epidemic and those working quietly behind the scenes to create a new age of patient safety. Through interviews with leaders in healthcare, footage of real-world efforts leading to safer care, and one family's compelling journey from victim to empowerment, the film provides a unique look at the future of our healthcare system's ongoing fight against preventable harm.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oCdm2glROuy4NSqQV0vA3v4jb7c.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"To Err Is Human: A Patient Safety Documentary","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
