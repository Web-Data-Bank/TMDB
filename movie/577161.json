In the past decades, Parreno has radically redefined the exhibition experience by conceiving this as a scripted space where a series of events unfolds. Now he explores the possibilities of the theatrical film screening as a coherent ’object’ rather than a collection of individual films. For the first time, Parreno presents a retrospective of his film works in the diegetic space of the cinema instead of the museum space. Parreno proposes a 'seance of cinema’ reintroducing in this traditional setting the magic and live rituals that lie at the basis of this art form.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/f6EipKO1j19rVBZRx0VSDUHfcoN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No More Reality Whereabouts","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
