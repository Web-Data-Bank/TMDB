In 1975, a wanted man hides out in a public restroom, where the graffiti on the walls speaks of the ongoing war and the toll it has taken on those who live though it. In 1982, a woman wonders where her boyfriend has gone as her isolation comes up against the abrupt and unexpected violence that plagues the city. A segment set in 1990 depicts a family that's been emotionally shattered by years of war. And in 2008, an elderly man living in a building that's been decimated by bombs shows off the snapshots he collects, which depicts people living under happier circumstances.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tfEbWYgwFRIjNJVCDXG6SyNPbf0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Falling from Earth","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
