This short film was taken from a feature film shot in 2008 called 'Dutch Courage' -- the film has been successful on my channels, so I felt it warranted a shorter version, concentrating on the gay love story.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zbmIG6Zfkaf6elcfVxzOT2zlqEQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113843,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nearly There Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Gay Dad","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
