As strange events begin to unfold, the locals become increasingly suspicious to the outsider.  Operating within a cinematic fiction of its own enigmatic design, ‘A Vacation’ immerses us in a specific yet elusive world where the silent and misty landscapes turn into the site of an equally silent violence and repression. With its evocative imagery and dark-scented ambience, Eroglu’s elliptic narrative offers an analysis of the illusion of freedom and the mechanics of repression at a time when these sort of reflections can be applied all too well to what is happening in the world around us.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9dVq4gY16nHooOhAEXr7CJmOJKP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Vacation","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
