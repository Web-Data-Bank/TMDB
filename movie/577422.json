Put simply, McGuire has taken Robert Wise's entire 1971 virus-from-outer-space classic The Andromeda Strain and re-edited it shot-by-shot precisely in reverse, so that the last shot appears first and the first last, though nothing is actually running backwards. As the film unfolds (or reverts?), more and more information about how the characters and their surroundings came about is revealed to us. While initially confusing, the film quickly takes on an ominous and mesmerising quality that defies description. The original film plot is one filled with tension in a 'race against time', which only adds to this effect.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rg18sGx4E7GN6YMXa9nXuLl2hXO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":126,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Strain Andromeda The","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
