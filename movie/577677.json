Fiction and autobiographical elements mingle in a lyrical tale that drags the viewer into a universe of beauty, death, and decay. Author and director Els Dietvorst zooms in on the raw reality of a rainy year that drives the farmer to despair. In a timeless setting on the Irish countryside, a contemporary parable unfolds, as enchanting as it is confronting.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Het dagelijkse (over)leven","title":"The Rabbit and the Teasel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
