This 10-minute anti-war film lost to posterity was a very loose adaptation of Franz Kafka's short story In the Penal Colony. Vesely presents the execution of a prisoner of war as a serial event that happens over and over again, ad nauseum. As of this project, Tichat worked as set designer and occasional co-author for Vesely, here also appearing in front of the camera as an actor together with H.C. Artmann. Gerhard Ruhm contributed his Musique concrete to the soundtrack.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1951-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Und die Kinder spielen so gern Soldaten","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
