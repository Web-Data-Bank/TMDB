The director confronts the silence on the subject through encounters with a man who cleans the apartments of those who die alone, a photographer who documents the aftermath of kodokushi, an elderly woman fiercely protective of her independence even in old age, and an artist who sings to pierce the stillness around her. By examining the quiet and lonely death, this film becomes a meditation on life itself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hhcjWGazMWJHmFcv4T7GcTjJIWV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Encounters with Silence","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
