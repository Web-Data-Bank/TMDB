A contemporary story about 10-year-old Sebastian and Eugene, a retired elevator man. Despite the age difference between them, they are struggling with a similar life situation - they are lonely, with no support in the family, forced to fight for survival, in a world that does not care about them. The fate of the characters is linked by a desire to get a 500-franc note, lost by a French pianist. The money fell into a deep sewage grid, from which it is not easy to take it out. They start a war with each other, use deceit, sometimes join forces to try to get the banknote on their own. With time, they become more and more exposed to each other.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/z7hW44CKoqEUuCsRSFRSC93GBJt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73037,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Filmowe Tor","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":97330,"logo_path":null,"name":"Telewizyjna Agencja Produkcji Teatralnej i Filmowej","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1996-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gutter","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
