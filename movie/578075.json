Heavy metal in Slovenia was forced to constantly defy nonconstructive criticism and was quite underestimated during its existence. Thanks to the steadfast persistence, irrepressible energy and at the same time peaceful ideology and a firm backbone, the heavy metal subculture succeeded to overcome the boundaries of the political system, time and space, thus becoming a part of culture and sociopolitical history of the nation. The authors of the film try to immortalize the spirit of this era of Slovenian music through testimonies of the main representatives of Slovenian heavy metal scene from those times, and offer it to future generations. At the same time, they want to pay these incredible musicians and their audience due respect which they rarely got during the time of their musical existence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/i07VtQcnWbUP31t7gxKivKFkMbV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":142037,"logo_path":null,"name":"Brncic \u0026 M Agency Production","origin_country":""},{"id":142038,"logo_path":null,"name":"GoreJanez Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":142039,"logo_path":null,"name":"TO3 Produkcija","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"2017-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Iron Footsteps","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
