As the man looks through the door crevice. A young girl, a middle aged woman and a old woman appear. They argue they are relatives of her, insist they won´t hand out a corpse, and ask for money. In the film, the color pink is seemingly connected to selfish fantasy about love of men. Just splendid color and light, and afterimages of them matter.","popularity":1.218,"poster_path":"/zigmV1fn7LbERt42ki4OatDxheD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":45370,"logo_path":null,"name":"Indiestory","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2018-01-12","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mystery Pink","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
