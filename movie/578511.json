Teetering on borrowed time and with his health in decline, Sudan's looming death and the uncertainty of employment that it will bring hangs over the heads of our three dynamic characters. Their only hope to save the species that they love - and perhaps their livelihood - rests fully in the success of a last resort IVF experiment.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iALzE8bfHr7nsosj8fF9AkNR0wU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Swahili","iso_639_1":"sw","name":"Kiswahili"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kifaru","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
