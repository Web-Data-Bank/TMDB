He doesn't want tomorrow to come because tomorrow means starting Middle School...saying goodbye to summer break and hello to homework. And even worse, hello to getting picked on by Meat, the terrible torturer of new kids. Luke's dread of tomorrow is casting a shadow on his enjoyment of his last day of summer, so he makes a wish that the Last Day of Summer would last forever... that his one last perfect day of fun and freedom would never end. But when his wish comes true, he discovers that he's stuck repeating the day over and over again, which, as Luke quickly learns, isn't any better. What do you do when the \"ultimate do-over\" isn't all it's cracked up to be?","popularity":3.683,"poster_path":"/t0WWVJ5nf8BcR4hXYJBs7T81eXQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5388,"logo_path":"/i6tbNeVEi7s1uN97s2o0LhEMuF0.png","name":"Sony Pictures Home Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":5371,"logo_path":"/2GFJ3jJ7dhjqcOGj41aTwd3OhQT.png","name":"Nickelodeon Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Luke Malloy is freaking out.","title":"The Last Day of Summer","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":15}
