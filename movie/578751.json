It is the tale of a hyperactive, temperamental artist whose talent and determination propelled the project, even as his ego and obsession threatened to tear it apart. It is the story of hucksterism and hyperbole, of a massive public works project in the midst of an economic depression. And it is the story of dozens of ordinary Americans who suddenly found themselves suspended high on a cliff face with drills and hammers as a Danish sculptor they considered insane directed them in the creation what some would call a monstrosity, and others a masterpiece.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bctNhDCwkXo9ajWOXlNsXfAAHZ2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mount Rushmore","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
