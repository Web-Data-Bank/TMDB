They are to conquer the river, with a 70 meter long raft. The ride is 300 kilometre long, always downstream. The freight: 25 000 bamboo trees. The men's path begins in the dense forests of the Sylhet region in North-Eastern Bangladesh. Millions of bamboo trunks are hacked down there and being slid down by the workers along the dangerous mountain-stream into the valley. The bamboos reach the river Kushiara through hundreds of these channels. Here, the trunks are bundled - a giant raft arises. Then the long journey begins.","popularity":0.602,"poster_path":"/wERvpEsyC20EVuhFwnlo2p9VukN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BD","name":"Bangladesh"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bamboo Stories","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":5}
