In Flight Pattern, Crystal Pite combines Górecki's haunting “Symphony of Sorrowful Songs” with a large dance ensemble to create a poignant and passionate reflection on migration.  Between them, Medusa is new work inspired by the Greek myth, created for The Royal Ballet by the acclaimed choreographer Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui, which juxtaposes Purcell arias with an electronic score by Olga Wojciechowska.","popularity":1.352,"poster_path":"/wc8eMf4vPgyNcBGwXGvvETfcOC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11514,"logo_path":"/uC4LtXWXfuDleivpGYSOsl8veXN.png","name":"Royal Opera House","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The contemporary face of The Royal Ballet is shown in works from three of today's leading choreographers.","title":"The Royal Ballet: Within the Golden Hour / Medusa / Flight Pattern","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
