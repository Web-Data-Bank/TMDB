Sergey Prokofiev's iconic score provides the basis for the ballet's romantic pas de deux and vibrant crowd scenes, while 16th-century Verona is created by Nicholas Georgiadis's magnificent designs.  In 1965, MacMillan's Romeo and Juliet was given its premiere at Covent Garden by The Royal Ballet and was an immediate success: the first night was met with rapturous applause, which lasted for 40 minutes, and an incredible 43 curtain calls. The title roles were danced by Rudolf Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn, although the ballet had been created on Christopher Gable and Lynn Seymour. It has been performed by The Royal Ballet more than four hundred times since, as well as touring the world, and has become a true classic of the 20th-century ballet repertory.","popularity":0.602,"poster_path":"/9nNkkN4PhmkGYYOXdPZyO4UqU89.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":149,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Prokofiev: Romeo and Juliet","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
