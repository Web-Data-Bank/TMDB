The film focuses on the photographers of Mussoorie, a hill station in the Himalayan foothills of northern India whose fame has attracted tourists since the 19th century. Through a rich mixture of scenes that includes the photographers at work, their clients, and both old and new photographs, this extraordinary film examines photography as art and as social artifact â€” a medium of reality, fantasy, memory, and desire.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mh1L0S2GYmUyFmfMquYRFR5su9J.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Photo Wallahs","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
