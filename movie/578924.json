Called the Ennio Morricone of Algiers, he composed music for more than 200 movies, amongst which the most famous films of the Algerian New Wave in the 70s and the 80s can be found. Paloma Colombe, a DJ, digger and documentary director, went to Algiers to meet his daughter, friends and former coworkers. Images of the city by night offer a perfect background to Ahmed Malek’s music. Globetrotter, pioneer of electronic music and of the concept of the home studio, he created a unique sound that truly goes beyond genres and countries.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/d7wVIX5lj452wLkDh7GkDY7tgoz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114156,"logo_path":null,"name":"Habibi Funk","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-18","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Planet Malek","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
