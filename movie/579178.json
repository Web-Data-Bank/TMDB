The project began by recruiting seven non-actors to participate in a mock menâ€™s social club, the activities of which were filmed in a constructed set. Part social experiment, part absurdist theater, Breakfast in Bed is organized around the constructions of masculinity and the male body through role-playing, team-building exercises, and improvised actions that was developed with the participants throughout the process under my loose direction. Through staged play, the video examines the constructed identities that the men come to rely on in a group setting while enabling and facilitating their agency to perform themselves in front of the camera.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Breakfast in Bed","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
