Artistically associated for decades with Barenboim and Berlin, Pierre Boulez is one of today's most distinguished composers and conductors. As part of the celebration, Boulez conducted a performance of Mahler's \"Resurrection\" Symphony at the Berlin Philharmonie.  With his uncompromising approach to the score, Pierre Boulez's Mahler readings have long fascinated critics and audiences alike. Boulez eschews the romanticized readings common in performance tradition and, instead, reveals the real joy and terror in Mahler's large-scale symphonies.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bdXJsMuWdZOZrpfuDZcHuB5K5Pw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79596,"logo_path":null,"name":"EuroArts Music","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2007-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Pierre Boulez conducting on his 80th birthday is truly an experience","title":"Gustav Mahler: Symphony No. 2 Resurrection","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
