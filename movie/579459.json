As a couple engage in an argument, which carries on over the course of an evening, we watch a man, presumably the man speaking, working the land & going about his chores, smoking, walking through a forest and watching fireworks.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1onENYnpEHNHgntzISHA8XOozkA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":45746,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cine Wiand","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"P.S.","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
