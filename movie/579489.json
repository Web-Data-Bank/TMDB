No bigger than the state of Colorado, this small country offers an incredibly diverse landscape view that changes dramatically with each mile. From snow-capped mountains to sandy beaches, and from the glacier-carved Fiordland National Park to the crater lake of Mount Ruapehu, New Zealand is a land of extremes. It's a place where fire clashes with ice and people are always pushing the limits.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/h5QvrHEipLexwYpAIJ4yxIMpOYP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18894,"logo_path":null,"name":"Smithsonian Channel","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Special Interest","title":"Aerial New Zealand","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
