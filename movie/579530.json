What happens when we move toward a fuller understanding of our history by including all voices? No other documentary has explored Black history in New Hampshire, no less Black history in New England. Shadows Fall North brings to light a forgotten history and continues a dialogue that is more important today than ever before. Without acknowledging our past, accepting it and embracing it, we will never move forward in our actions about race in this country.","popularity":0.846,"poster_path":"/c1WsaiwwmWrQMsrasspH0Zi7P3s.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114284,"logo_path":null,"name":"Center for the Humanities, University of New Hampshire","origin_country":""},{"id":114285,"logo_path":null,"name":"Atlantic Media Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":121,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Black History IS New Hampshire History","title":"Shadows Fall North","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
