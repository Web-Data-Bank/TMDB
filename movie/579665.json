Throughout the film, the central character goes through the small motions of everyday movements like checking the time and having a drink, with each frame rendered in a different art historical style. The film starts in ancient Egypt and progresses through Chinese ink paintings and Japanese block prints to Modigliani and Basquiat-style portraits. Cao renders a vast array of art styles in a manner that is evocative without being overworked.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tPyiVlCKSjjXuLfGoQLo2BAiRk1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-08-21","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Minute Art History","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
