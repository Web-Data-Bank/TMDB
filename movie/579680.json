Although one of the mainsprings of the work, the Shakespearean parallel is here bitterly ironic: unlike Lady Macbeth, Katerina Ismaïlova who, in the remote reaches of rural 19th century Russia, falls in love with one of her husband’s employees and is finally forced to commit suicide, is less a manipulator than a victim of a violent and patriarchal society. Krzysztof Warlikowski liberates all the subversive power of this scorching and scandalous work, which marked the early years of the Opéra Bastille.","popularity":0.934,"poster_path":"/omIVvWVCbzwhZ3gGQq17ZUkhPCA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15355,"logo_path":null,"name":"Opéra National de Paris","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2019-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Opera in four acts and nine parts (1934)","title":"Shostakovich: Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
