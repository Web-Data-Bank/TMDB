Drawing on my own extensive Super 8 archive and a growing body of Mini DV footage the film portrays a fragmented and nostalgic view of a part of the world that has proved vital to the very fabric of my existence.  Amongst the sonic flotsam and jetsam lie littoral truths, half-truths and coastal myths. Both melancholic and absurd the ‘coastcard’ is a confusing missive from a place of hope.  It is a reminisce and flawed celebration. Hastings as a place where both memories and people are pulled towards the sea in a strange state of ‘reverse evolution’.\" – Andrew Kötting","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Edgeland Mutter","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
