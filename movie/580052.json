Perhaps the only downside to having such a formidable catalogue is that there are just too many great songs to fit into a single set. However, you would be hard-pressed to find a fan who wouldn’t want to hear 1987′s seminal Abigail in its entirety, and Songs For The Dead Live captures this, twice, and in very different locales. The performances of the all-star lineup of musicians, comprising of guitarists Andy LaRocque and Mike Wead, bassist Pontus Egberg and drummer Matt Thompson, are absolutely ferocious, hammering home every single moment.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/liwmkm9qQAuu5domqVoI7orcnKo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34487,"logo_path":null,"name":"Metal Blade Records","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"King Diamond : Songs for the Dead Live","video":true,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":4}
