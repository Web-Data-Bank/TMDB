People have always felt the rhythm of music and have as a result evolved countless dance styles throughout the ages. Beginning in the late 80's in Melbourne's underground dance music party scene, a revolutionary freestyle dance began to grow and has now developed into the most unique and robust underground dance style since the birth of Breakdancing. The Melbourne Shuffle has no set steps but encourages individuality and imagination, incorporating dance moves from numerous styles such as miming, popping &amp; locking, liquid and breaking.","popularity":1.16,"poster_path":"/phFBsLoMOk1PRBwKBDrRg8ZrDp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51527,"logo_path":null,"name":"Underground Epidemic Productions","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A revolutionary documentary about an underground dance style.","title":"Melbourne Shuffler","video":false,"vote_average":9.8,"vote_count":2}
