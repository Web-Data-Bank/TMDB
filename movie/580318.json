But one of them is not like itâ€™s brothers and sisters. It does not act piggish at all. No lazy hanging around, no digging the dirt, no getting real fat. It seems much more exciting to roam about on the farm. The watchdog, which has to keep everything in order on the farm, is getting more and more desperate.  Janis, that's the name of the little pig, is creating a wicked disorder all the time. Until the day when a man appears on the farm who wants to buy a sucking pig. And it is just Janis, he chooses.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9JnmVZxuyUBxBejAAMJ3b3zNri4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":47629,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dingo Pictures","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Janis the Little Piglet","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
