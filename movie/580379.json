Morning rising, television, photographic session, lunch with mother and brother, work, a visit to a porn company, meeting with a friend and work colleague, thoughts about life and love, the difficulties of opening up and surrendering in love, dinner in a friend s house at night with a full moon. His relationship with his family, his dog and the world. His lonely lifestyle. A mother he adores, an absent father, a view of the future without exaggerated ambitions and unrealistic dreams. Without lies, illusions, with respect towards the others and dignity. A pure life, like the tattoo that we see in the making on his body during the duration of the whole film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/d3TVre3L8XN8o63DPXZTmRqY6XL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":143757,"logo_path":null,"name":"Amanda Livanou Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2015-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pure Life","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
