More precisely, it's about what's absolutely left to be said, on the social and artistic levels, about male sexuality. Travelling Alone is a cinematographic meditation on men and their libidos. This film tells the story of a man who brutally finds himself confronted with the vicissitudes of his own desire. Little boys are not taught that their virility, their capacity for turgescence, may one day go bankrupt. What happens then? What happens when a man, still young, discovers that his best years are behind him? That his life, from then on, will be an endless work of mourning his access to sexual pleasure? Such is the topic of Travelling Alone: a man who searches his past to find the first signs of what was going to be his fate as an adult.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/N8YfrIn6eKBJkgfZR762rAV6Jp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Travelling Alone","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
