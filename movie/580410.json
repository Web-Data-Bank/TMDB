The program weaves together diverse stories - from urban and rural America, from the heartland to New England, from San Francisco to Harlem. Deeply moving and often humorous, viewers will get a glimpse of awakenings, first crushes, unlikely soul mates, intimacy and liberation. While separated by circumstance and upbringing, the film’s subjects are all united in their shared experiences of self-discovery, coming out, pride and love as well as a triumph over adversity and a true sense of belonging. Against the backdrop of historical events, each also traces their own hopes, struggles, influences and contributions towards advancements in equality and broad social change.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vMwEAA2Zsp9cTBYCQAZJmUZNz3p.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Out in America","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
