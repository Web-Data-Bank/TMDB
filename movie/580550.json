Culture shock seems to be the least of the group's worries as they get to know more of the people from the sleepy little town, but once they get to the forest, everything begins to fall into place. After two of them are brutally slaughtered, it becomes painfully obvious to the remaining campers that a pack of sadistically gleeful lunatics is making a game out of methodically hunting them. As they fight for their very survival, unexpected twists further complicate matters, leading to an ending that is as shocking as it is disturbing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ffP3Dyd1KTMOuwDiS4iOvIN0zLw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last Getaway","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
