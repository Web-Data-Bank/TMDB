Although there is no cure for HIV, the tritherapies, which have been available since 1996 and are constantly being improved, now make it possible to live with it: HIV is no longer synonymous with AIDS, more than 80% of patients are therapeutically successful; this is more than diabetes. The promise of a vaccine is constantly being postponed: what solutions can be found to ensure that one day we can finally talk about the end of AIDS? What kind of prevention should be implemented to make it effective? This film takes stock of the major medical advances made today and investigates the successes and failures of HIV.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xfkBCVKzLraSH3dttsyVca3wqkb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-08-02","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Good Bye Sida?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
