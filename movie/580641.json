The film wrestles honestly with the unique questions and circumstances men face today. Kingdom Men Rising takes a journey that challenges men to rise above what we have become to lives of no more sitting on the sidelines, no more passivity, and no more excuses.  This film draws from the experiences of author, pastor and speaker Dr. Tony Evans to provide clarity on this topic. Matters of significance, priorities, race and passivity are addressed from a biblical perspective. Featuring Grammy-award winning entertainer Kirk Franklin, Heisman trophy winner Tim Brown, former Dallas Cowboy quarterback Jon Kitna, Super Bowl winning coach Tony Dungy, NFL vice president Troy Vincent, author Priscilla Shirer, and others, Kingdom Men Rising provides an honest portrayal of today’s man that is countered by God’s original design.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9aZV3TuWBFil2ZC3SvLTITqBrvg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":156627,"logo_path":null,"name":"LifeWay Films","origin_country":""},{"id":156628,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tony Evans Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-04-29","revenue":1188936,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"No More Excuses","title":"Kingdom Men Rising","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
