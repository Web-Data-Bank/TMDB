The band performed for hundreds of thousands of fans across Europe and North America, as their level of global critical mass reached new heights largely fueled by a rediscovery of favorites from their beloved repertoire. This live performance was filmed in front of a sold-out crowd exceeding 18,000 fans on March 17, 2018 at the Ziggo Dome in Amsterdam. TOTO performed a wide range of songs, including hit singles, rarely performed live deep cuts, and two recently recorded tracks which appeared on their new Greatest Hits album (40 Trips Around The Sun).","popularity":1.046,"poster_path":"/xvVlRxrgQeheHhkp8UB1S8CFuBe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85481,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eagle Rock Film Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":141,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Toto: 40 Tours Around The Sun","video":true,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":4}
