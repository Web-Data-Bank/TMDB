Filmed in the underbelly of Buenos Aires, the film plunges the viewer in the murky investigation of a crime where love, money and betrayal are all intricately woven together. With seductive strains of Tango in the background, the viewer is jarred by the counterpoint between Marcial's discourse - his version of the events as told to the police - versus the truth on the screen.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ayWsZ1L0ReG49Qqam78BJKi3mU6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Love, money and betrayal are all intricately woven together in Marcial's police statement","title":"Marcial's Version","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
