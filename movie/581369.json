This is an opera set in a hard masculine environment, about repressed passions and the weight of guilt - but also about rebellion, the power of beauty and about release.  Director of Opera Annilese Miskimmon herself directs this masterpiece, featuring an exclusively male cast.  Director Annilese Miskimmon and Set and Costume designer Annemarie Woods, take us onto a submarine during the Vichy regime in 1940s France. Here we meet a close and claustrophobic environment, controlled by sailors’ discipline and the meaningless necessity of war.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/AnQvRcDfHohbDnuwp9dQTQDaCRE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Billy Budd - Olso","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
