There have been some memorable puppet-theatre performances of opera, but with Caligula Le Poème Harmonique and Arcal invite us to savour something quite original by bringing together two artistic traditions that have long been separated: those of Venetian opera and Sicilian puppet-theatre. On stage, the singers and instrumentalists, conducted by Vincent Dumestre, lend their voices and rich sound to the pupi of Mimmo Cuticchio, large stick-puppets belonging to a great theatrical tradition dating back to the seventeenth century.","popularity":3.941,"poster_path":"/IQ29MGsBWJhwpjjlcNKSvaEV3K.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":159650,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arcal","origin_country":""},{"id":159651,"logo_path":null,"name":"Le Poème Harmonique","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Caligula","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
