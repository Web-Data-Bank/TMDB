Gilles is arrested by SS soldiers alongside other Jews and sent to a camp in Germany. He narrowly avoids sudden execution by swearing to the guards that he is not Jewish, but Persian. This lie temporarily saves him, but Gilles gets assigned a life-or-death mission: to teach Farsi to Head of Camp Koch, who dreams of opening a restaurant in Iran once the war is over. Through an ingenious trick, Gilles manages to survive by inventing words of \"Farsi\" every day and teaching them to Koch.","popularity":12.589,"poster_path":"/ppReRGszmdZC2194keN4cGoLIPQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71156,"logo_path":"/jnYrp67FATgZgyP5Qvy9VgxvBR.png","name":"Hype Film","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":114678,"logo_path":"/d8rUvXy3pM4heBhDDmZCZTdwaGa.png","name":"LM Media","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":39720,"logo_path":"/ibYDOzRUY7y8PHdM7JGuw5YLlcp.png","name":"One Two Films","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":157119,"logo_path":"/9Wf5DFTvzxo0pSqDp8MQWW3d01.png","name":"Belarusfilm","origin_country":"BY"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BY","name":"Belarus"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2020-04-17","revenue":3825668,"runtime":127,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Persian Lessons","video":false,"vote_average":7.698,"vote_count":310}
