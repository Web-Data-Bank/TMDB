Getting to the final was his big chance but for some reason he froze against Ray Carter and the match was almost a whitewash as Bobby could not pot another ball! A few years later he's performing trick-shots wearing a mask in small clubs and trying to move on but whatever stopped him potting in the final before has resurfaced.
