During this thorough investigation, we take a close look at patented drugs, why they are so readily prescribed by doctors, the role insurance companies and HMO's play in promoting compliance, and the problem of rising health care costs. We will examine the marketing and public relations efforts on behalf of the pharmaceutical companies, including sales reps, medical journals and conferences.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":15900,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gary Null \u0026 Associates","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Prescription for Disaster","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
