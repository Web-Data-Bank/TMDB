Older brother Danny concocts a daring scheme to steal enough money for the two to escape, timed around the chaos of an upcoming Rolling Stones concert. The sensitive younger brother, Brian, ultimately has a choice: remain loyal to the brother with whom he shares a powerful love-hate bond, or use his hidden talent as an artist as his own ticket out of their dead-end existence.","popularity":5.083,"poster_path":"/2PhS5FoPvF0SWSVWqWEUv5B85FB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121462,"logo_path":null,"name":"Annus Mirabilis Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"White Irish Drinkers","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":27}
