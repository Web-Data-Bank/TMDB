In particular the titles ‘Castle One’ and ‘Castle Two’ made symbolic reference to Kafka’s book ‘The Castle’. In this book, like ‘The Trial’ the central fictitious but ‘first-person’ existential character was ‘K’ – clearly in part an oblique but intentional reference to Kafka’s own name. The short video sequence used in ‘For the Benefit of Mr. K’, was shot in the little street in Prague showing the small house in which Kafka wrote ‘The Trial’. The title is also a direct reference to the song by the Beatles. The sound track is a short sequence discovered by my son of the Beatles rehearsing this song in the Abbey Road recording studio.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fHm1AuMggBCiqZLJEXpopxzzP3M.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"For the Benefit of Mr. K","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
