Though the boy was my own grand-son, it was never seen as a ‘home-movie’ – the child’s face is never seen and it was shot over his shoulder - as close to his ‘point-of-view’ as I could get. As a young man and as my own children grew up, I was greatly intrigued by the book ‘The Construction of Reality in the Child’ by Swiss psychologist, Jean Piaget. Piaget made an exceptionally close observation of the changing stages of behavior of his own children which provided me with a conceptual framework for my own observations.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nnf0Nvu4HLJHQ2jzwF8E7BLyTdC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Critical Moments","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
