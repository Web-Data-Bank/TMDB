Dad & Kids walk to work and school, mom tends to her shop connected to the house while taking care of the pre-school child. But the stuff of life happens in the everyday! This is 'simple' story about repentance and forgiveness. It is simple only in the face of the tremendous atrocities of the Rwandan genocide against the Tutsi. It portrays the relationship between 2 brothers, one oppressive, the other forgiving. The effect of forgiveness and thoughtfulness of the one younger brother on the oppressor, his older brother, can only be realized when the older brother allows his conscience to speak! It is as old as the story of Cain and Abel.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fora","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
