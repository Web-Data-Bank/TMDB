Alone and free, he wanders the countryside. In farms and villages both good and bad luck come his way; a farm boy, a young toff, a cute stable lad, a forward young fisherman. All cross his path. But nobody keeps him for long and he always leaves alone. Always? No, the younger son of a country doctor, fleeing from his incestuous brother, follows him on his travels. They share everything; friendship, adventures, the lessons of life - and meetings with other boys.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/c2MesBhiqIXKXVfoYbit1URHhJt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":65668,"logo_path":"/qHpNaCy2IGoTdyQkI2eD972E7Va.png","name":"French Art","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Traveling Journeymen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
