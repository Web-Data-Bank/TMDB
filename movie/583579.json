Offenbach’s operettas inspired and influenced the works of Johann Strauss, Jr. and Arthur Sullivan. So, even though his works are less familiar in the United States, fans of “Die Fledermaus” or “The Pirates of Penzance” will likely find this amusing work familiar territory.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4ReYOZHEMjng0T0gqS98EdG5LIT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Grand Duchess - Wichita","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
