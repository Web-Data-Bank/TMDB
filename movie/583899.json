An almost somber beginning that rises to brilliant exaltation. As with PASTORALE, extremely innovative for its day and even now. Entire film was an \"optical print\" to retain light nuances. Has never been placed in competition.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qy72tK5QOhL6H2P3ea3mYecHw0P.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1963-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Non Catholicam","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
