The experiment is then repeated in green, then in light red, next blue, and finally pale yellow. It’s a very Hitchcockian approach to creating meaning, as if all the elements - object, colour, space and time - had been isolated from the suspense, only to be reconstructed anew, creating silent, artificial drama. And, as with Hitchcock, the motifs are fetishistically charged: knife, dog, door, bird, lion: ‘...they are all Freudian in some sense’, observed Goldstein.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fT8p1IlF2n9JAsYBo1UvKEmUb46.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Knife","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":1}
