The whole process is kept secret and follows strict rules: only sinless believers under the age of 65 can be resurrected. The film is set on the computer of Stanley, an on-line church priest who helps those who were brought back to life. He is divorced and his son lives with his ex-wife, so he can chat with him only on-line. Stanley's son was the first person to be resurrected after he died in a car accident that Stanley caused. Soon Stanley learns that there is a huge conspiracy behind the resurrection process.","popularity":7.641,"poster_path":"/nWw1x5CpLN25s4i5ZUIXOMhqyY6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109501,"logo_path":"/4dtmZKPLHzIALpGbdeSNX6Rw1p3.png","name":"Bazelevs Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":92840,"logo_path":null,"name":"Logical Pictures","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"There are no saints among the living","title":"Resurrected","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":4}
