See a handful of world-class riders demonstrate the latest innovations in street, mountain and trials unicycling. Defect combines groundbreaking filmmaking with a fresh soundtrack and bonus rider commentary, to showcase the skills and personalities of this rapidly emerging sport.  Highly technical and highly entertaining, this video features some gee-whiz riding that will make you wince many times. Dan Heaton's skill as a filmmaker is as outrageous as his riding.  Released on DVD in 2005, Defect became the most popular full-length unicycle highlight film to date. Building on the street and trials riding featured in previous films (UNiVERsE - 2000, UNiVERsE 2 - 2004), it also introduced the beginnings of flat-land unicycling.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2MFdHSuk92ZNPAFjSI3lXJYWdUB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115175,"logo_path":null,"name":"Syko Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"New from the makers of Universe and Universe 2: Dan Heaton of Syko Productions introduces Defect, the DVD.","title":"Defect","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
