Now there’s a brilliant full-length documentary from Matthew Cox that follows the amazing machine’s local Australian debut at the 2013 World Time Attack Challenge and subsequent summer spent in New Zealand. I really like that film makers are moving on to longer, more in-depth films rather than just eye candy – and I think this project shows why.  Do yourself a favor – grab a beverage, sit back and check this one out.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dream Build Drive","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
