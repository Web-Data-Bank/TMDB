She peels off the mask from a society, in the eye of the storm, that claims to be liberal and in which everyone has an opinion about everything. Secure between her four walls, she touches the darkest spots of her life- a bomb attack, a failed marriage, coping with depression. A young, modern woman in today's Israel.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vgWA14ZxU5o0WfoXtVYvyclPNrY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115243,"logo_path":null,"name":"Beit Berl College","origin_country":""},{"id":72371,"logo_path":"/e9jTO4uAvemFH6holMC4V1SUGh4.png","name":"ifs internationale filmschule köln gmbh","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2018-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tamar","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
