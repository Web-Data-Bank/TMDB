One of America’s favorite speakers, Ken offers up a brilliant performance that pays tribute to veterans, explores the differences between men and women, and ponders the question… Is it Just Me?  Appearing at a beautifully-restored Vaudeville theater in Sheboygan, Ken also shares his disastrous adventure with snow-boarding, his short-lived experiment with weightlifting, and his painful encounter with a nose-hair clipper. His keen sense of comic timing is mixed with a side-splitting dose of physical humor, and the result is a memorable hour of laughter for all ages. No, Ken, it’s not just you – we’re all a little strange. But thanks for reminding us that we are loved in spite of our shortcomings – and thanks for pointing us to the source of true joy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1bDKd8y7Odg7Nfvf3EGA5uCN30W.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ken Davis Live: Is It Just Me?","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
