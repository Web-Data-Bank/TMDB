With a producer who stole money from his mother's retirement account to fund the film, to a director who thinks she's the next Francois Truffaut, to an actor/editor who is a doormat for everyone, this motley crew of misfit filmmakers have a tough time navigating the chaotic world of the Sundance Film Festival. Ignorance, foolishness and above all ego drive the team to implosion as they struggle to realize their filmmaking dreams.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pezZmjcviPwPHLMmcrvY3lKAnt5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On the Corner of Ego and Desire","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
