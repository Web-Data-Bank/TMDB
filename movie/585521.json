A blizzard of 1950s and 1960s archival material -- such as television commercials, news broadcasts and comic book pages -- is presented as a way of illustrating the pretensions of what the filmmakers feel was a decadent era. A chronicle of the many and fleeting mid-20th-century American fads and trends is juxtaposed against society's attitude toward the different and unusual.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vr8LrlOczZnvrUMTyKKl3rPCd36.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Neon Palace","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
