Shot and edited by a world-class director/editor since 2012, In this second film, in Spain, is shot in an extraordinary private garden that overlooks the Straits of Gibraltar, where the Atlantic Ocean meets the Mediterranean sea.  As well as the dramatic and unique location, we are delighted that we were able to bring a total of twelve rowers to Spain this year.  The privacy of the garden, the warmth of the Mediterranean summer and the camaraderie between such a large group of rowers make this a film like nothing weâ€™ve made before.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":115482,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sport Allies Charity","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Film follows 2018 Calendar shoot in Spain","title":"The Warwick Rowers - WR18 The Spain Film","video":true,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
