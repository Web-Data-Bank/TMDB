Stored in a permafrost deep-freeze for years, these remains are in pristine condition and represent an unprecedented window into the life of the Pleistocene Epoch. John finds a passion for bones and for collecting, assembling over a hundred thousand specimens from his mine site, â€œThe Boneyard,\" and invites a team of expert paleontologists to study the collection. As the scientists wade into the mud, and peruse the boxes of the collection, discoveries are made that could potentially re-write the history of North America.","popularity":1.214,"poster_path":"/hvDHsKyg13xABUXkrlMXNTYHy36.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115514,"logo_path":null,"name":"GlacierFilm, LLC","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boneyard Alaska","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
