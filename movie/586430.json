The video series investigates the architecture of the new towns (Villes nouvelles) and brutalist habitation buildings in the surroundings of Paris. Cities such as Noisy-le-Grand, Montigny-le-Bretonneux, Créteil, Grigny, Cergy-Pontoise, Nanterre and Ivry-sur-Seine were at the center of this research. Created using photographs, 3D animation and video synthesizer, Machine for living combines documentation and abstraction and straddles the line between utopia and dystopia.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ktJ1mjjVLHh4z1EyFRe4o7JezSF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Machine for Living - Montigny-le-Bretonneux","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
