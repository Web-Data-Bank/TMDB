With a sense of humour, but earnestly and profoundly it examines this very symbol and indicator of women's self-determination, a mystic source of life and anarchic threat to patriarchal systems. Made a symbol of the forbidden, the vulva is attributed its due cultural significance only by being heavily negated, while its fictitious existence as a focus of male sexual phantasies and the pressure to adapt exerted on women make it a significant economic factor. From church to psychoanalysis: what women carry between their legs seems second-rate to the primacy of the penis. But VIVA LA VULVA can also give hope to those awaiting a turn towards a self-determined female sexuality and a new, confident self-definition of women. Not deadly serious, but with informative verve we tell the tale of the new self-awareness of the female sex.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ixLwSR70MgEnGRqsmnwObooP9VV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115599,"logo_path":"/oy7KfmJ1cVX4JlmheLukhHvrkox.png","name":"Nikolaus Geyrhalter Filmproduktion","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2019-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Viva la Vulva","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
