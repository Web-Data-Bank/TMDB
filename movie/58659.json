He is given a cruise ticket by an aristocrat who is an old school friend, and is mistaken for the aristocrat when he uses a camera that has his friends name on it. Assia Noris plays a maid who falls in love with him because of who he is and not who others think he is. Happy ending comes when De Sica marries Noris, who is more real than the pampered society belles he has been partying with.","popularity":1.838,"poster_path":"/sQ5O2fOmjDc9AyrcY2e5My8B1H7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37776,"logo_path":null,"name":"Astra Film","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1937-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mister Max","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":15}
