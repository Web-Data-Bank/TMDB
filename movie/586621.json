This is a touching story about us as youngsters, when everybody is against the whole world and tries not to become “one of them”. But can one keep the promise? The story is based on the best seller by Jānis Joņevs set in the 1994 in the Latvian city of Jelgava.","popularity":1.974,"poster_path":"/zBUnWXROKVyAfeZINMiOEZfHiiz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85188,"logo_path":"/dt6pAG7kCbPrzwcp92NMxTGJyLJ.png","name":"Juris Podnieks Studio","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2019-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jelgava '94","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":8}
