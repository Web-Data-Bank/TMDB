Two cameras film in alternation this derelict facade from two changing viewpoints. They pan in opposing crossways movements and develop a picture view that appears to extend beyond the edges of the screen. The durations and sequencing of one shot in relation to another are not pre-scripted; the shooting patterns take the form of a space-time game where a new movement or action on one camera provokes a corresponding reaction from the second camera.” –William Raban","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Time Stepping","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
