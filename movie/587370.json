As they run around the house, he wonders. What if he dies before they grow up? Can he leave something to them? He sets to write: about a man who finds a thrown-away book able to bring the reader back in time... About two boys who discover a hut that nobody wants, where fantastic monsters used to live... About two orphans and their strange aunt who turns into a cat when no one sees her... About a lonely man who knows how to fly and becomes king of birds... Maybe kids will learn from these stories that have one thing in common - they're all about the hidden value “Of Unwanted Things and People”.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/orIs8uyqNIGWKWxC23CFCFuvmr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6719,"logo_path":null,"name":"MAUR film","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":115763,"logo_path":"/g9jxB6NTRBi80IM1yb2lwNSMmeN.png","name":"Artichoke","origin_country":"SK"},{"id":115764,"logo_path":null,"name":"WJTeam/Likaon","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":115765,"logo_path":null,"name":"ZVVIKS","origin_country":"SI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"},{"iso_3166_1":"SK","name":"Slovakia"},{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Of Unwanted Things and People","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
