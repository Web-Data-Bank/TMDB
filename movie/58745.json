In this latest and most vicious game show to emerge from the Japanese underground, four contestants (a husband and wife on the edge of divorce, an office lady and a school girl) are locked in the Red Room to draw cards in the \"king game.\" Whoever draws the king selects two others to enter a cage where one performs the most outrageous acts upon his or her unlucky victim.
