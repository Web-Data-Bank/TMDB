They’re young, lonely, and all they have in the world is each other. They spend their lives moving money for other people. They attend a poetry class at the local cultural center and watch cockfights at a dorm for migrant workers. Their attempts at finding poetry in the prosaic world around lead them to the conclusion that the only poetic move they can make is to rob a bank. The film isn’t about words or rhymes. It’s about friendship and betrayal, and about our vicious and alien world in which anyone who tries to be honest and consistent ends up looking naïve and cruel. It’s about the everpresent and incomprehensible force that — in spite of everything — makes our life so frantic, strange, and lonely","popularity":1.253,"poster_path":"/96N7t5DDe3Kj8XgDvULECj7uYgV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6344,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pavel Lungin Studios","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":140702,"logo_path":null,"name":"Addressfilm (RU)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2019-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Great Poetry","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":3}
