Inari, his girlfriend, is tired of Janne's incapability of getting a grip on life, Janne wasn't even able to buy a digital TV box that Inari had given money for. Inari gives an ultimatum: a digital box needs to arrive by dawn or she leaves. Janne sets out into the night with his two friends to find a box. On their way to the city of Rovaniemi, Janne and his friends face many challenges, obstacles and temptations. They learn that they need to be daring. There's no room to give into bitterness. The most important thing isn't success, but rather the journey in itself.","popularity":3.357,"poster_path":"/3Xx7ozeiCRXcfyNZPi9KZEaDMZF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17537,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anagram Film","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":6159,"logo_path":"/pbWyMDcAM6s228tiUxjl3v1OAxr.png","name":"Helsinki Filmi","origin_country":"FI"},{"id":17821,"logo_path":"/bZp3beVId2zVhxrxrsagnale23c.png","name":"Ripple World Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":2801,"logo_path":"/bswb1PLLsKDUXMLgy42bZtCtIde.png","name":"Film i Väst","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":1898,"logo_path":"/8ix6SGlJiyuUDxLBtY8E0PY2G7w.png","name":"Screen Ireland","origin_country":"IE"},{"id":78061,"logo_path":"/cOAcVckLXzalE7MsKjfMRB0CnWW.png","name":"Suomen Elokuvasäätiö","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"},{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2010-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A couple of variables","title":"Lapland Odyssey","video":false,"vote_average":6.438,"vote_count":73}
