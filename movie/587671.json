Add them to the end of the name Falcon XW and Falcon XY and you have an Australian Motorsport legend. Between 1969 and 1973, the mighty GTHO had a massive impact on the local touring car scene. In the hands of Canadian born Allan Moffat, the Phase I, II and III GTHO’s set fire to the imagination of Ford fans across the country.  In this DVD, we trace the origins of the GT from the original Falcon XR GT piloted to victory at Bathurst by Fred Gibson and Harry Firth, through the Moffat glory days and dominance at Bathurst in 1970 and 1971, right through to the GTHO that never raced, and perhaps the ultimate version, the Phase IV. Adding to this high octane mix are the drivers who helped create the legend, Allan Moffat, Fred Gibson, John Goss and John French.  This DVD is an essential part of any serious enthusiast’s collection as it details the evolution of arguably Australia’s greatest Muscle Car, the Falcon GTHO.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vPMOR9lU2gBYZgTbHi2JsVoCaNz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-08","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Racing History of the Australian Falcon GT-HO","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
