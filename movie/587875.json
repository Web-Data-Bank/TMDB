The secret police has almost  eradicated  the  network  of  social  democratic  fighters.  Only  one  group  continues  fighting and a bold assault on a factory cash desk is being planned. A low ranking fighter Grey is assigned to lead the operation.  Meanwhile, Grey starts an affair with a young poetess Violet and gets to know the flamboy-ant crowd of decadent artists and writers. Inspired by Violet Grey takes a look at revolution from  a  different  perspective.  Meanwhile  Violet  gradually  gets  involved  in  the  dangerous  world of revolutionary fighters. November 1906 in Riga is still remembered as a month of crazy bohemia and violent terror.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nC91zWMB94pUUWcsWwy2u5ykRzq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22084,"logo_path":null,"name":"Latvijas Nacionalais Kino Centrs","origin_country":"LV"},{"id":74959,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Studio Tanka","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2019-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"1906","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":4}
