That is, right up until she disappears from the back seat without a trace. When confusion gives way to reality, he resets his meter and is instantaneously transported back to the moment when she climbed into his cab. He and Penny find themselves trapped in an endlessly looping nighttime cab ride, with only each other for company, and it changes his life forever.","popularity":3.864,"poster_path":"/zJ81X7T8OrtiWFCEBhtKo0TVqgN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115881,"logo_path":null,"name":"501 Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":115882,"logo_path":null,"name":"Public Displays of Affection","origin_country":""},{"id":115883,"logo_path":null,"name":"Grady Film","origin_country":""},{"id":122637,"logo_path":null,"name":"Devilworks","origin_country":""},{"id":153351,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dread","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A fare to remember.","title":"The Fare","video":false,"vote_average":6.75,"vote_count":60}
