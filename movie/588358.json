Over the years, many film rolls were exposed - they all tell much more than just the story of this one person, they also bear witness to the city on the Förde before and during the war. The result is much more than an atmospheric insight into a private family history; it is also and above all a fascinating time document of the city Kiel. The visual material of Dr. Schulz shows unique quality. This man was certainly a dentist; but he was also a great talent at the film camera!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7xSoUDtV0wYMlUvTPqB6pIfFPfD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115933,"logo_path":null,"name":"EinfallsReich","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A filmed childhood between 1936 and 1949","title":"I have KIEL to tell","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
