On a quest to find her biological father, teenager Yeni is sidetracked when she's raped by her stepfather and ends up in a nuthouse. After she's released, her prostitute sister takes her to work at a brothel. There, she becomes second wife to an old, miserable man until her stepfather returns and tries to lay claim on her. After unsuccessfully trying to strangle Yeni to death, he and Yeni's mother get in a fight and end up stabbing each other to death. Once Yeni finds out she's pregnant, she's then rejected by her miserly husband, who denies the child is his.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/10rxwbrbDq69MpHXtf3Fsv8B2t1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lake of Tears","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
