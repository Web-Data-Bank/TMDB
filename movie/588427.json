This project uses the medium of film and aerial dance to distort the audience’s perception of what is physically possible, altering reality and creating an illusionary body/spirit dissociation.  The film creators draw from Limerick's history and culture to influence both the narrative and some of the film’s imagery. The title alludes both to the well-known Irish dance and to stories of the city, from the Vikings and the siege of Limerick (1690) to the current cultural and social realities of Limerick.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/n7dFX2uXUSOHwOMWzlblurOE2N5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145623,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kat and Dawg","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2019-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Walls of Limerick","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
