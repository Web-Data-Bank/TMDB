Featuring Snarky Puppy band-mates Michael League (electric and upright bass) and Robert Sput Searight (drums), with contributions from percussionist Felix Higgenbottom and a full string section and French horn.  This is a truly great contemporary jazz piano concert with nods to modal jazz icon Bill Evans, post-Coltrane piano giants McCoy Tyner and Herbie Hancock, and the fusion of Joe Zawinul & Chick Corea.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/963WblME0HOR9jSvjfJdhKvouVh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bill Laurance - Live at Union Chapel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
