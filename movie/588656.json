Isabel, a journalism student, is forced to do her internship in the newspaper of a small Galician coastal town in order to finish her degree. When she arrives, she wants to start investigating as soon as possible, to demonstrate everything she has learned in order to become a real journalist. But the position she is assigned is the last one she expected: the writing and management of the obituaries that reach the newsroom. But this, which might seem boring at first, becomes the door to an investigation that will take her through different parts of the Spanish geography in search of an impossible love story.","popularity":5.481,"poster_path":"/oxbnkrC2GWEVbkUPzwFi1QX1qbP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29566,"logo_path":"/wHbtRtUnXGNzX0riQIpq1fcgueq.png","name":"Atresmedia","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":27628,"logo_path":"/8rluD2KhZHZbEOiAKW5qbBxyD0R.png","name":"Bambú Producciones","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2020-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El verano que vivimos","video":false,"vote_average":7.086,"vote_count":70}
