He twists cardboard, builds object castles, admires them, talks to them, breaks them, dresses and dances with them. The ceremonies are repeated and mutated, the environments change and the objects multiply creating a kind of dissonant choreography built with remnants of amateur video. The plot gets more complicated when between those objects his memories appear and force him to fight in a duel of dances with his past.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jyxd0M6Tlc2oiXMmSWaQ0iNqIw2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2018-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Contemporary Move","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
