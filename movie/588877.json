The process introduces emphatic flicker that helps create illusions of depth, even for a single eye. But flicker is not for everyone and should be avoided by those with unusual brain conditions.  Abstract-Expressionism was a way out of thinking of WWII and Mitchell was among the best of its practitioners. Paint is what happens in her work, inspired by nature but transfigured and with no obvious reference to objects. Her great range of paint applications, however, do invite the imagining of them in depth. Imagined in depth, yes but not the all-too-convincing illusion show here.\" - Ken Jacobs","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ieAfWoOsh8ulqtAcndRCWtjGjMw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-05-23","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Joan Mitchell: Departures","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
