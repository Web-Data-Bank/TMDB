The painter will give Mikel one of his paintings as a gift, but on one condition: the musician will have to go and fetch it in London, by ferry, crossing the sea. Taking the journey as an excuse, we will enter the everyday life of an artist committed to living from his work until reaching the key hidden in the centre of every artistâ€™s labyrinth, since all searches are in fact a voyage; the creation process in itself is a voyage.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7RihbFKpIuwTCKgyOqeZOPYSbWe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116028,"logo_path":null,"name":"Maluta Films","origin_country":""},{"id":46559,"logo_path":null,"name":"Atera Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2018-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Basque","iso_639_1":"eu","name":"euskera"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A film about Mikel Urdangarin","title":"The Painter","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
