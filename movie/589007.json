Granted, the space we enter with them is not one of healthy connections between human beings encountering each other in a functional polis. Clearly, theirs is a world of radical disconnects. At the same time, however, it is a world in which people invent highly idiosyncratic lives for themselves - if there is one thing missing here it is precisely uniformity - and in which imaginaries go haywire. Indubitably, the Hardy/Bouwer airport lounge is a dystopian space and this space, it seems fair to say, functions as a synecdoche for a larger social condition. But dystopia here stands in radical opposition to uniformity and it is determined to break the mold of late capitalist habitus (Dominique Malaquais, SPARCK).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2pMrA9xjbatOf7NemafdQ1ZMmi2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2005-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"an airport waiting lounge","title":"I Love You Jet Li","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
