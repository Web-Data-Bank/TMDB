Poetic mix of \"Dawn of the Dead\" and Aimé Césaire's \"Et les chiens se taisaient\", one of the great texts on decolonization. It stars a dancing astronaut who takes over the body of Neil Armstrong. The process happens in slow motion. At times, it is nearly imperceptible, and yet it is inexorable: an act of anthropophagy, metaphorical and ironic, that calls simultaneously on historical tropes of colonization and present day fears of contamination by immigrants and viruses alike, prevalent across the bunkered, gated and razor-wired space of the global urban bourgeoisie (Dominique Malaquais, SPARCK).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The voice on the moon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
