She is wearing casts on both of her feet, pounding each stair with great effort, the once ubiquitous scratch and wobble of videotape distinguishing this piece from the work of her contemporaries using film. When she reaches the top, she removes the casts, revealing the artist's bare, naked feet, suggesting that perhaps these cocoons must be shed before she can enter the sacred space of her studio. - Stela Jelincic","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fragments of a Self Portrait","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
