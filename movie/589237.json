As police investigate, the story takes a shocking turn when the admitted shooter claims the crime was a sanctioned hit ordered by a rogue CIA agent. Authorities dig deeper, but find no record of the agent, and actually discover that the killers have been catfished. Who is behind the fabricated government official? Ripped from the pages of renowned prosecutor Dennis Brooks' new book, TOO PRETTY TO LIVE is a story of betrayal, vengeance, and two overly-protective parents manipulated into committing murder.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xFL71q43Bt1JtZim5Y7uwshbkQb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32788,"logo_path":"/uJqWKL25ChNSAxn9Dsr7GNPc0Sw.png","name":"Nancy Glass Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Too Pretty to Live","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
