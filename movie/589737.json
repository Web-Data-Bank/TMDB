Their starting point is the announcement to Hagar, Sarah and Mary as in the Old Testament, the New Testament and the Koran. Their thoughts spread out and weave a new web, drawing strands from their associations and interpretations of these texts. And by talking about their own history, their personal myths, they work up to subjects such as the birth of image in the Christian world or that of poetry in ancient Greece. Announcements is a film about the movement of thought, the power of words, the secret of the voice, and the seduction of the image.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gLJnOcbz1Ru0YzQaqx06Q5xeZXb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":67421,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dérives Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":27334,"logo_path":"/isv4Bkxbt75rfX4abGhc5fmyxp4.png","name":"Laila Films","origin_country":"IL"},{"id":13146,"logo_path":null,"name":"Esperanza Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":76921,"logo_path":"/dkPpGhEL2uQ5bmNDAqSZRFp894g.png","name":"Les Films d'ici","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Announcements","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
