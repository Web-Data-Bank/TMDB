Foudraine (Who is of wood). The Werkteater played this performance 'in the den of the lion': in psychiatric institutions for patients and carers. This led to very intensive and adventurous performances in which 'a lot' always happened. Afterwards the discussions sometimes ran high, but even during the performance the audience sometimes mixed themselves in the scenes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":116182,"logo_path":null,"name":"Werkteater","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-12-22","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Toestanden","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
