Still today LOURDES is more alive than ever. And Our Lady remains active and attentive to each of her children. About 6 million people visit it every year. After the pandemic, her devotion is increasing. The multitudinous processions of people seeking a miracle feed a small army of caregivers (nurses, volunteers, hospitalists) who accompany them. These pilgrims are an amazing display of humanity: accident victims, the terminally ill, an overweight teenager being bullied at school, a group of prostitutes and trans people from Paris, etc. LOURDES is an insightful meditation on the human capacity for empathy and hope, and especially a journey into the mystery of religious faith in the face of life's profound tribulations.","popularity":1.106,"poster_path":"/oQPwpdAaL51nt7h1fTPJ8OoMFuA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123176,"logo_path":"/1xfVfLus4m7J7LkbuPM4yPy4Aqp.png","name":"Falabracks","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":23123,"logo_path":"/cEqVIluQuO1ubtID8RvOem4ZiIg.png","name":"Mars Film","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":591,"logo_path":"/q5I5RDwMEiqoNmfaJgd2LraEOJY.png","name":"France 3 Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2019-05-08","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lourdes","video":false,"vote_average":6.905,"vote_count":21}
