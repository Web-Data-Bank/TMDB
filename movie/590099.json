The story concerns a worker's wife, who is bored with her dreary existence in the wilderness.  She walks around in the snow recalling how she met her husband, then goes to the landing field to catch a departing plane.  But she remains when her husband tells her how much his work means to him.  This moving and very humanistic tale represents the NFB at its best.","popularity":0.621,"poster_path":"/3IQ5WgG1rzu3PWtrvGFHtRicTSr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1965-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Snow Has Melted on the Manicouagan","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
