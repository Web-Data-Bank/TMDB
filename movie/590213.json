In preparation of a debauchery evening, they get wasted, smoke some joints and talk about sex.

A sensible and sincere look on a confused and reflective adolescence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jDd7bgLEAdjmSrRRF0nLwHj4jG9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2015-02-26","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shopping Center","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
