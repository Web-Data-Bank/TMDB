With their successful live DVD/CD \"Barefoot To The Moon\" (No. #20 at the Media Control Charts Germany 2015), recorded and arranged with pure acoustic instruments and supported by a four-piece string ensemble from Prague, the band has impressively shown that the original's great heritage can be interpreted in an interesting, inspiring and absolutely creative way. Now in early 2019, the group will release their successor and electrical continuation entitled 'Live From The Dark Side (A Tribute To Pink Floyd)\", recorded live at 'Rock Of Ages Festival 2018' in Rottenburg-Seebronn, Germany.","popularity":0.691,"poster_path":"/2SCM9CNFaRXGRScWJXn8zAc09xJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116425,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pride And Joy Records","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Echoes - Live From The Dark Side - A Tribute To Pink Floyd","video":true,"vote_average":8.7,"vote_count":3}
