The viewing platform for our 36¾ mile journey is a 2-car class 143 Pacer operated by Wessex Trains. Some of the delights of any journey over this route are the classic GWR stations at Kemble and Stroud, little changed over time. As well as the usual shots of the driver at work, trackside runpasts and station sequences, there are aerial shots taken from a helicopter.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/e1FvGwLPbaQYrkSSR2htIPZ7iIJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70985,"logo_path":null,"name":"Video 125","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2006-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Golden Valley - Swindon to Gloucester","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
