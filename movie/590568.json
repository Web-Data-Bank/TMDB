It is the last place you would expect to find a nice little blonde girl putting all the lads to shame, but Hazel Findlay is doing just that. The first woman to climb the British grade of E9 (super hard, super sketchy), Hazel is a connoisseur of loose rock, dodgy gear, and big run-outs. Having mastered the scrappy sea cliffs at home she teams up with Emily Harrington to tackle the massive, untamed big walls of Taghia Gorge, Morocco.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jxj0QsZKZ9rzUNOhYdPpMQouWsN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spice Girl","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
