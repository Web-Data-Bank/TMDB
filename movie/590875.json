Resisting biography—refusing historicisation—and instead attempting to harness a narrative borne by Gysin himself. A transcendent un-biography, Hotel Bardo is an ultra-travelogue set in a vision of the public domain in which the living and the dead pass freely to play with the idea of origins and posterity. It manifests primarily through experimental film, documentary, intervention and literature.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1pc6KdW5fc1U1xzKKE7U8RBtk0W.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hotel Bardo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
