While there is an inevitable streak of political commentary that runs throughout the work – a political current that cannot be escaped when talking about Kashmir – Chronicles from Kashmir does not espouse any one political ideology. We see ourselves as being artists and educators, using aesthetics and pedagogy to engage audiences with diverse perspectives from/about the Valley.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/obPZGnIFGmYxFYZkfOSlHbhhxAf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116385,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ensemble Kashmir Theatre Akademi, Srinagar","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Urdu","iso_639_1":"ur","name":"اردو"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A step, though, a small step toward engaging audiences in stories and experiences that mainstream media might never share with them; a small step toward sparking more educated -- and less polarized -- opinions about what is happening in the region.","title":"Information for/from Outsiders: Chronicles from Kashmir","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
