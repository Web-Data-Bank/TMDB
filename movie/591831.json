He makes a bet with a friend that he can get a date with a star of the Broadway stage. It isn't long before Stage-Door Johnny Magoo winds up on stage in the play during a dinner scene, and performs rather well considering he was hearing the dialogue for the first time. Later, he is firmly convinced he had taken the Police Gazette beauty to dinner. No, her name wasn't Andre.","popularity":0.841,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":8409,"logo_path":null,"name":"United Productions of America (UPA)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1958-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Magoo's Young Manhood","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
