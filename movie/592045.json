A greaseman, the image model for Poverty, bums around the Edsa Revolution anniversary which ousts another corrupt president, Estrada the actor. And Tony D., the shrewd short-fused citizen of the Philippine ghetto, sets his sights on foreign classmate Steve Banners, a pompous self-righteous dude with delusions of America's grandeur at the expense of Third World inequity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bmoLTzS5zjsPm7KeXQdXygCiTeI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16821,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmless Films","origin_country":"PH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2008-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Overdosed Nightmare","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
