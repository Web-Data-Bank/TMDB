Central characters in the narrative are Hermes, in the form of a seal, and Pegasus the mythological horse, both bearing witness to the voyage of the imagination, unhindered by the straight jacket of history and time. The animation has a dual meaning; it is both symbolic meditation on a journey into the unknown through the eyes of Pegasus and the seal, both hoping to heal wounds and create a sense of unity in their universe and also an exploration of the geographical history of the Thames and Rhine, which 10,000 years ago formed one single river.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/Ag3BqofU9gsrIqtUNkbI4fb7Kbj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Marriage of the Thames and the Rhine","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
