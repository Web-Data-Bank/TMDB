Now he plays pachinko everyday with his live-in girlfriend, Junko. He has a habit of \"huffing\" paint thinner. His debts accumulate every day. Hisashi's old friend from the gang, Ozawa is a loan shark. He persuades Hisashi to join his easy-money-making scheme, \"Quit inhaling paint thinner and score big with me!\" Hisashi's dead-end life is made up of the same things that symbolize contemporary rural Japan: Karaoke clubs, pachinko parlors, ATM loan machines and discount outlets along a highway.
