Spyros is driven for his sake by separation from his spoiled and wealthy fiancé, Katerina, and the usual problems in such cases begin. In the pre-existing class differences, the hatred of the people in his circle, who do everything they can to prevent it, is added. Spyros, however, is totally determined to cope with life the way he thinks - and eventually succeeds.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eqNtlr1NjaRnG6yyIdvGfTCPasO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21968,"logo_path":null,"name":"Spentzos Films","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"1967-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Η Γόησσα","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
