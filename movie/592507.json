The company runs out of money, and it looks as though Mamie and her dancing colleagues are going to be stranded in Europe with no way home. Luckily, she meets a handsome, well-spoken Englishman Peter Millett (Hulbert), who falls in love with her and proposes marriage. Under the impression that he is a man of means, she readily accepts, imagining an entr√©e to English high society. The couple return to England and Mamie discovers to her horror that not only is her new home a decrepit farmhouse out in the sticks, but that Peter is a widower and his three children also come as part of the package.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1937-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You Live and Learn","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
