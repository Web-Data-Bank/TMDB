The performance, a parachute jump, is carried out by an artist (Perrenet) and his girlfriend during the opening of an exhibition. As spectators to the performance, which takes place in the artist’s studio, an art dealer and several friends have been invited. The art dealer enters first, followed by Armand, who looks at some paintings made by Zwartjes; they spout the usual ‘gallery nonsense’. The art dealer appears most interested in the girlfriend. ‘My latest creation’ is how Amand introduces her. The guests who arrive thereafter are introduced in short, independent sections.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sldIj1HQ0a5iFYQFm9JkkdtX5hl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Extremo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
