Louis, a photographer, convinces the general of the French Army to send him to Mexico to photograph the colonial war that is ravaging the country. Once he is there, nothing goes as planned. Never in the right place at the right time to see the battles, Louis can't snap a single picture of the war. But his encounter with Pinto, a Mexican peasant, changes his destiny. It leads him to discover neither glory nor wealth, but a way to confront the ghosts of his past.","popularity":1.589,"poster_path":"/dm5cJrYOXfYiZeRkmeZbb0GMhx7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":86172,"logo_path":null,"name":"Imaginaria Films","origin_country":""},{"id":7792,"logo_path":"/72Dyvk7Xo4m6uxRNpe52PxT5BrK.png","name":"Noodles Production","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2019-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Towards the Battle","video":false,"vote_average":4.9,"vote_count":9}
