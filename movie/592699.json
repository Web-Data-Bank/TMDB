To celebrate her birthday Adi, the young poet she loves, steals a car and takes off with her to a beach. The two lovers do not realise that the car belongs to a thug who is following them - a thug who will not hesitate to kill. SUNETRA can be seen as a metaphor for life itself, where death is always hiding behind the trees.  As always, the Babusenan Brothers are exploring their philosophical concerns here through the medium of the film story.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8qHDk95lgJYOSUr3qBsA0WXl2O5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85514,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fifth Element Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2019-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malayalam","iso_639_1":"ml","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Pretty Eyed Girl","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
