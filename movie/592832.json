But the history of Ferguson, a formerly whites-only \"sundown town,‚Äù and the neighboring black town of Kinloch, now semi-abandoned, is not well known. Incorporating reflections of residents of Kinloch and Ferguson (including Gillooly, who grew up in Ferguson), this film explores the relationship between these two towns. Beginning with a 1960s roadblock that divided then-white Ferguson from black Kinloch, the film depicts a micro-history of race relations in America.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/172NfMCYZTPVvSna3rBfsx5dp8Q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Where the Pavement Ends","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
