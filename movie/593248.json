This caused mental challenges that resulted in his lifelong illiteracy. At 13, he began selling his body on the streets as a drag prostitute. When he was arrested, he took a dump in the back of the police car, leading the cops to give him the moniker: Dirtwoman. Since then he's run for mayor, gotten kicked out of the inauguration of America's first black governor (Douglas Wilder), posed for his own pin-up calendar (weighing in at 350 pounds), offered crabs from his crotch for a GWAR video and hosted the annual Hamaganza fundraiser that provided 'Hams for the Hamless.' When he died last year at 65, it was on the front page, top-of-the-fold of the Richmond Times-Dispatch and was featured nationally on NPR.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4g8EHafUeiloVLlksFO8FJSyZ8A.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spider Mites of Jesus: The Dirtwoman Documentary","video":false,"vote_average":9.5,"vote_count":1}
