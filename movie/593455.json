A great secret could save their lives - or else bring death and revenge.  One of the great achievements of French opera, Fromental Hal√©vy's La Juive was controversial from the start. For some an insult to religion and the state, for others a plea for tolerance, it is above all a human tragedy about a persecuted family. Roy Cornelius Smith and Corinne Winters star in this award-winning production by director Peter Konwitschny.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pw9JBBhxumU3DJVw7Ncmc8OXnVx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Juive - Vlaanderen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
