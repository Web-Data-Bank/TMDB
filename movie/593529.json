There is no plot. The thread that holds this full-length feature together is an animated hippie character who sits in his living room listening to a Los Angeles radio station while smoking marijuana. His “high” allows him to dream up all the images on-screen. Although the film is overly long and, for that reason, seems disconnected, the photography and art work (by Patrick) are quite enjoyable. The picture seems meant to be viewed by young people and might find appeal in selective showcasing. Anton Noel produced, directed and wrote the film, done in four-channel Quadrophonic sound. Soundtrack is available from Storybook Records.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cNTETMFLKnfNiRJaODhQdyaebkc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116829,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sunshine Unlimited","origin_country":""},{"id":116830,"logo_path":null,"name":"Real Live Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1975-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"See it loaded...with music.","title":"Guitar Picks and Roach Clips","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
