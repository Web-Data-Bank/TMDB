We start with steps imported from other dances, like the waltz, then sped up. Next Walsh and his partner show some basic steps, but the movements are too swift for the narrator to describe them or the viewer to learn how to do them. By the end, various couples (all but a pair of briefly-seen children are white), including some comic ones, give a high-speed demonstration as the music rocks and swings. These are hep cats. Pete Smith's narration is full of slang.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xQEpBRvmoz9p3ZRHAOKo5LfG46r.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21,"logo_path":"/5Va1Ie5c4sjfEYqixQ3L8qg7fKu.png","name":"Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1944-02-19","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Groovie Movie","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":2}
