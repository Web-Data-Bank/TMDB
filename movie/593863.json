Linking places as far flung as the Canadian Northwest Passage and a cellular prison in the Andaman Islands, the three Missives create an extended narrative recited by the female captain of a ship returning to the Thames from the Canadian Arctic. Meta Incognita: Missive II is based on the exploits of the Elizabethan privateer turned explorer Martin Frobisher, who repeatedly sailed to the Canadian Arctic in search of the Northwest Passage. Set in a future where global warming has opened up the Northwest Passage to heavy/commercial/trans-continental cargo trade, the narrative follows a renegade shipâ€™s captain who has undertaken a commission to smuggle the last remnants of an unspecified natural resource.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meta Incognita: Missive II","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
