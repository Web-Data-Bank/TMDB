Making good use of bulb shooting – extended exposure – which was Fukuma's specialty, responding to the light and shadow of water and fire, the moon and the sun, Sakurai traces the historic spots of Kyoto, his living ground. Contradicting with the glorious music, the view is a total lamentation and can be taken as a requiem toward the sudden loss of Yoshio Fukuma. With no after-treatments, this non-edited shooting creates a complete harmony of distinguished camerawork and solid lyricism, offering full satisfaction for Sakurai's original and extraordinary talent.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/17pvsjPRYHDdvKo8UypkEX0hDsz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116954,"logo_path":null,"name":"Voyant Cinémathèque","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dear Mr. Fukuma","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
