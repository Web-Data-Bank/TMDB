When he arrives, their conversations circle around existential questions and news from afar. Unrest cloaks the world outside. Mother and son grow closer, silence melts into words, and life springs between them. The son leaves, and winter settles in to the forever-outdated house in which temporalities blurs and past and present beat to the rhythm of the same clock.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2zPXSwESp2Ng6XeqNfdCUkGE0QM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125028,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ucqar Film","origin_country":""},{"id":125029,"logo_path":null,"name":"Subobscura Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"AZ","name":"Azerbaijan"}],"release_date":"2019-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Azerbaijani","iso_639_1":"az","name":"Azərbaycan"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When the Persimmons Grew","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":3}
