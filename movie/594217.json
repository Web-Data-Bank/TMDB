Autumn 1958, a family of Breton peasants in their Sunday best, gathered around the eldest. Smartly dressed for the photo. A modest living honestly earned by laborious work”. This is what the narrator proclaims at the beginning of the film, leading us to see things through his eyes. The photo, taken on the occasion of the golden wedding anniversary of the director’s grandparents, is the catalyst of Ordinary Landscape and the symbol of a way of life that is now gone.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vOWgy6ltWzyCXzAOBDSD3MAAMde.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52077,"logo_path":"/u0gxqaV1RJlMmLL7APDzR81bYIT.png","name":"L'Image d'aprés","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":123241,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films de la pluie","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2019-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ordinary Landscape","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
