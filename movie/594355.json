A Lot of Sorrow is both a music video and an extended concert film, in which Brooklyn-based band the National performs its three-and-a-half minute ballad “Sorrow” on repeat for six hours. The band’s music and lyrics frequently conjure notions of romantic suffering and melancholy—themes common to Kjartansson’s emotive, theatrical work.  As the hours pass and fatigue sets in, the musicians subtly alter their song; the original track is always recognizable but is also shown to be elastic and expressive rather than rigid. Kjartansson is sometimes visible in the role of roadie, offering water and food to the performers throughout the concert. Multiple camera angles grant the viewer access to both the perspective of the musicians and that of the audience, as the band and the crowd feed off each other’s energy with every repetition.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/CEs9nq0IvTVmRId3fLUYBfjau9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"2013-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":369,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Lot of Sorrow","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
