Adam discusses the intricacies of sign language, the politeness of the Dutch, prostate awareness, what it feels like to have an \"old man rant\" and the joy of seeing the Paralympics live.  Of course, no Adam Hills show is complete without including members of the audience, so you'll also see an impromptu boyband, a sex toy goody bag and much more. Let Adam Hills inflate you with this riotous live show. Joyous. Uplifting. Inflatable.","popularity":1.791,"poster_path":"/irxkLx6ZjsBaHwmGoUZ2q2Rldwq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4400,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Pictures UK","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":7479,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blink TV","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2011-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Adam Hills - Inflatable","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":2}
