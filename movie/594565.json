The film explores the key personal relationship in his life, that with his wife Marie, and follows him to Harvard, New York and London, to readings, signings and public interviews.  Offering compelling insights into the working life of a major writer, it digs deep into the rich store of Heaney's poetry to reveal a man who lived his life fully; used his gifts to give expression to the great themes in all our lives of love, loss and longing; and managed, as a man and as a writer, to combine the simplicity of a farmer's son from County Derry with the sophistication of a major artist.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oDTwliOPezfylPEZKhE4zgZpG4R.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2009-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seamus Heaney: Out of the Marvellous","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
