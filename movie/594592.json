Eight- year-old Timothée the little half-blood, is getting ready to take the plane to Africa... Although on his mother's side the family is from this continent, he knows it only through tales of witches and elephants. He travels there with his 31-year-old mother Aya. She's taking him with her to Ivory Coast despite the ongoing war because she wants to visit her father's grave and reestablish contact with her family.
