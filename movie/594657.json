Yoshimoto proves this point with most simplicity. Placing a tiny point of ray in pitch black, his darkness achieves a limitless depth. This style goes under trial from around 1988 – a squirming object in drowning darkness goes through a transition from a solid machinery part to a soft Japanese architectural fixture to a misty female figure. Each of the objects, a subject of fancy, is placed in good balance, mingling with Rei Harakami's sound effects. This is one of Yoshimoto's most intense works.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3n5PyakoBISmlRJQfYYb8ztys9i.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116954,"logo_path":null,"name":"Voyant Cinémathèque","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"fan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
