The city’s peripheral architecture goes by like the setting of a retro futuristic adventure gone wrong; the governmental utopia of the housing estates, the laminated dream of the Euro Disney Park, the playgrounds and sports areas now used as spaces for getting high. The Parisian suburbs are thus revealed like the theatre of a failed political project, which has only intensified the differences between the deprived neighbourhoods and the city centre. However, the youth filmed by Manon Vila is not defeated.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p1WKY7BPNnA4LqRRp8YZeWlqXh0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":122663,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les écuries productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Akaboum","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
