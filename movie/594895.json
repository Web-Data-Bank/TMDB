Following in the footsteps of Walter Glass—a fictional researcher who disappeared during his investigation into the decommissioning of the site—Beyond the North Winds: A Post Nuclear Reverieexplores the inhospitable landscape of this coast and offers a reflection on the links between myth, technology and scenery. It focuses on what has disappeared—the researcher, a cottage that mysteriously went up in flames—to talk about what will remain of us, be it the ruins of a Neolithic shelter, abandoned nuclear infrastructures, or stories, myths and legends, transmitted from generation to generation.","popularity":0.608,"poster_path":"/A18L1QH7V9SsM5GodtGI2Y8SSEB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beyond the North Winds: A Post Nuclear Reverie","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
