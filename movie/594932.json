Comic relief in Glyndebourne's ‘brilliant production’ is provided by ‘beautifully sung live-wire performances’ of Pedrillo and Blonde, and Robin Ticciati leads the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment through a restored, authentic rendition of the critical score with ‘lovely fizz’ and ‘poignant gravitas’ (The Independent). Filmed in High Definition and recorded in true Surround Sound.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A6GWoLnznFgjpnhjs3vV72nG1zB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":168,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mozart: Die Entführung aus dem Serail","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
