A landscape of precipitous terrain, with its crest lines and its chasms, serves as a pasture for several hundred cows. Amidst the dance of the diggers and trucks discharging their loads onto the slopes of a mountain of rubbish, a herd makes its way through the chaos, in search of something to graze. This nightmarish decor in which bovines live, copulate, play, sleep and die, becomes the scene of an appalling spectacle.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/l6SaQArJURM0yGHCLu47mR42TTX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":144970,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ingatan Visual","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"2019-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Diary of Cattle","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
