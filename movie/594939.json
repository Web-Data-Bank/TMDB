From now on dreaming is forbidden in his realm, and art and culture have to suffer as well. Then the dreamers revolt. Animation based on a story by Belcampo from 1934 offers rudimentary animation, combined with stock footage and film clips. The result is a rich and playful film, with a lot of affection for imagination.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pJUr3bdfKUmutGkhDFw2Uj7s1HC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2019-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"De Driesprong","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
