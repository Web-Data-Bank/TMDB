The weather is ideal for shell fishing in the shark-infested waters of the Japanese Sea of Hegura Island. Yet Aoi, 21, still a novice, is nervous to dive in front of her more experienced grandmother. Machiko, 82, is a traditional Ama free diver, meaning \"woman of the sea.\" She is one of the last custodians of a 2 000 years old expertise, one of harvesting abalone and the other precious shells that once had a place of honour at the emperors' table.The Ama tradition is passed down from mother to daughter but for several generations now the ice-cold waters, the scarcity of seashells and the mortal danger that represent both sharks and other fishing boats have discouraged the younger generation who is migrating to Japan's large cities.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1WirRm0Z3UqyLQqDlfTVvd044A7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ama, de mer en fille","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
