By unscrupulous dealings and with the use of Ann's savings, Amos meets with considerable success and casts aside Ann, who is forced to take a job as maid in the Graves mansion. Amos begins to court Shirley Graves ( Irene Rich ) and causes Ann's dismissal. Mrs. Graves ( Helen Dunbar ) persuades Shirley to marry Amos, despite her love for the penniless Douglas White ( John Patrick ). Ann marries James Warren ( Robert Agnew ), an architect, whom Amos hires to build a mansion, and Ann tells Shirley of Amos' previous perfidy. Shirley has an affair with Douglas White but becomes disgusted with illicit sex when she believes him to be unfaithful to her. Amos' schemes fall flat, and he is arrested for swindling. In prison he repents, Shirley's attitude toward him softens, and they are reconciled when he is freed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/51H5dwAhfEVfTm2BF7KKUOFu02A.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":174,"logo_path":"/IuAlhI9eVC9Z8UQWOIDdWRKSEJ.png","name":"Warner Bros.
