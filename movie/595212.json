Another favourite subject is the rose, not only featured in the title of several films but is also the name of the production company he formed with his future wife, Nam Hung, who also stars in most of its productions. Rose in Tears is in fact the company's inaugural project. The story features two painters, one famous and the other struggling but both infatuated with the same delicate rose of a woman, negotiating their ways through art, commerce and love. With this heart-tugging story, Chor finds a vehicle for his baroque impulses, relishing in lavish images and over-the-top emotions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gsKEAKbn8YnOw30BAKk7qCqPbK6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82670,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rose Motion Picture Company","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1963-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rose in Tears","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
