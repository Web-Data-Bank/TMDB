Riafn is a sort of dialect based on the different forms used by the shepherds and farmers of this area to call their beasts. The inhabitants of the mountains have thus cadenced their day-to-day life on calls to animals, the mooing of the cows, songs and the echo of the mountain. A sort of Alpine orchestra that helped them to cope with isolation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kZ1jZKXyVrGAVd4ef6f3qoKzzjJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"RIAFN","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
