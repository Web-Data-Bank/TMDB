In Japan, there are craftspeople who go far beyond this to reach a special kind of mastery. These people are called Takumi and they devote 60,000 hours to their craft. That's 8 hours a day, 240 days a year, for over 30 years. It's an almost superhuman level of dedication to a life of repetition and no shortcuts. This film asks the question: Will human craft disappear as artificial intelligence reaches beyond our limits?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kZkiFcElIMe9ev4Agw9Q1XmXYPV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73620,"logo_path":null,"name":"Saville Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Takumi: A 60,000 Hour Story on the Survival of Human Craft","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":4}
