Artist, poet, surrealist, philosopher, warrior, general, cynic, statesman, spoiled son of a rich man, genius war leader or a bon vivant? A Serb who learned French language before his own, a convinced communist who made fun of the communist dogma, sportsman, vice-president of Yugoslavia who drove to work in his Spacek? Answers to these questions could be: all of this and none of it really. In fact, who is Koca Popovic remains a mystery even today. A mystery that this film will at least try to unravel.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/s77bvRfIYicjfcgBvowYAfwYD2H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73078,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmske Novosti","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"}],"release_date":"2015-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Konstantin Koca Popovic","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
