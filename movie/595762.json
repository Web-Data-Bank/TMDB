The twelve years that composed the post-war Reconstruction era (1865-77) witnessed a seismic shift in the meaning and makeup of our democracy, with millions of former slaves and free black people seeking out their rightful place as equal citizens under the law. Though tragically short-lived, this bold democratic experiment was, in the words of W. E. B. Du Bois, a ‘brief moment in the sun’ for African Americans, when they could advance, and achieve, education, exercise their right to vote, and run for and win public office.","popularity":2.448,"poster_path":"/vCtYCMQghiyiJ0MxPqttuDuE64Q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":83427,"logo_path":null,"name":"Inkwell Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":83426,"logo_path":null,"name":"McGee Media","origin_country":"US"},{"id":91992,"logo_path":null,"name":"PBS Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":240,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reconstruction: America After the Civil War","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
