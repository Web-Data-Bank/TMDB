That man is Felix. Felix is not someone who seeks confrontation. If he had a super power, it'd be his ability to roll with the punches, to bend like a willow, to not rise to every challenge or provocation like some jumped up, testosterone-fueled frat boy. Felix has always thought of this as his greatest strength, it's his armor and what makes him such a nice guy. Though when Felix finally learns of his wife's infidelity, surrounded by all the superficial glitz and glamour of some Hollywood pool party, he suddenly comes to a realization. The realization, that deep down, what this actually makes him, is a doormat, a loser, a putz. But right now, in this moment, he has a chance to do something about it, to show what he's made of, to completely break the mold and become the person he's always dreamed of being.","popularity":1.099,"poster_path":"/rJk8HsJexpzeezDLQoo6Tggh2pQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117230,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kite Rock Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":117231,"logo_path":null,"name":"Virgin Soil Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sorry About Your Wife","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
