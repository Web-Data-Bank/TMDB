In 2018, for the seventh time, a motion supporting legal, secure and free abortion was presented to the national congress of Argentina. The project provoked a fierce debate, revealing a society divided more than ever between the pro-life and freedom to choose positions. Through an assemblage of passionate testimonies, Let It Be Law documents the determination of women fighting bravely to secure the right to physical self-determination, and bears witness to their massive mobilization in the streets of Buenos Aires.","popularity":1.627,"poster_path":"/d2BHABVExbwuoRmgZcS1uWjVreJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97010,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sur Cinematográfica Argentina","origin_country":"AR"},{"id":47197,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films du Sud","origin_country":""},{"id":118429,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gameland","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2020-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Let It Be Law","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":36}
