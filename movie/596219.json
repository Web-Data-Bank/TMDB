He has already composed the songs for it. His husband Marcus, his best friend Claudia and the couple Lars and Nina, who are friends, will also be involved in the film. The movie premiere is to take place on Roland's 50th birthday. However, a cameraman is still missing. The shrewd TV producer Torsten Norola makes the an unbeatable offer: Roland will be provided with a cameraman if the station is allowed to accompany the entire shooting for a new docu-soap format. Shortly after filming begins, the first small obstacles get in Roland's way: Claudia is still in love with Roland; an argument with his husband Marcus; Lars falls in love with Roland; Nina wants out; and then a murder. All of a sudden, the film doesn't seem to be finished after all. But Roland can't possibly pay the penalty of 100.000â‚¬ to the broadcaster.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bxpsvDYCuUKWiOJ0eR7pFDdUDBt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Das Beziehungskonto","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
