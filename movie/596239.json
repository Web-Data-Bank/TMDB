Growing up in Kenya, where homosexuality is still criminalized, Faith was forced to keep her identity hidden. When she is targeted for being queer, she flees Kenya and seeks asylum in the U.S. where she builds a new life for herself. Years later, Faith, her Jewish wife Jenny, and their son Hayden travel back to Kenya for the first time together. Through interviews with Faithâ€™s family and friends, this documentary paints a complex portrait of LGBTQ life in Kenya, and the sometimes uncomfortable culture shock and interpersonal dynamics of a mixed race, cross-cultural queer relationship. Audiences will be charmed by Faith and her family, and deeply moved by her journey to bridge her many worlds and bring them into the same universe.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/znK3Fz9hz2gCIZkC2jOJNLdKOnp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Faith","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
