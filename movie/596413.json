These images are processed and vectorized frame to frame. It focuses on the textures that emerge by shaping terrain, shapes and forms, proposing a permanent play between the formal limits among abstraction and figuration. It seeks to put in tension the referent of the film; what it has been (characters in a space-time recorded with a camera ) along with what it is (figures dissolved in surfaces and reliefs of a visual and sonorous matter in constant mutation and alteration).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4qKS2uqC1OSs8ySJbKzuS4driJJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Topographies of a distant noise","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
