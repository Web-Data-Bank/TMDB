Wagner's adaptation of the story reflects the rebellious mood of a Revolutionary Germany, vindicating sensual love and attack the fanatical repression of sexuality by a puritanical and hypocritical authority. As the prose says, \"Shame to him whose cruel striking/Kills for faults of his own liking!\". One of the most extraordinary musicals based on a text by Shakespeare, especially worthy of a new performance as it is four hundred years since the death of the Bard.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nTwX8Dy84BRFSFpz7wn10mQVAlw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4775,"logo_path":"/z1HSU7AQ04jeOICLE1mBzEJxiEJ.png","name":"Opus Arte","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":92079,"logo_path":null,"name":"EuroArts","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":71999,"logo_path":null,"name":"Teatro Real de Madrid","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":981,"logo_path":"/pkrdO9ykplO4Zc8edikoSX5APUN.png","name":"TVE","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2016-02-19","revenue":0,"runtime":160,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Based on Shakespeare's \"Measure for measure\"","title":"Das Liebesverbot","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
