Trained and exploited by a brotherhood of mystic monks to slay all enemies of the church, fate brings him back one night to the castle of his father, armed with the monster-slaying Sword of Laertes, to destroy the vampire Vladislas and reclaim a holy relic: The Bloodstone. The events of that night turn Radu from a noble man into a vampire with no master, setting him on a centuries-long quest for sustenance, and companionship, for the treacherous one who stole him from the sun, and for the Bloodstone he hopes will bring him peace.","popularity":7.381,"poster_path":"/jUJQHOWmXAeTStXQNNJhHefTN9g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15352,"logo_path":null,"name":"Full Moon Features","origin_country":"US"},{"id":1295,"logo_path":null,"name":"Charles Band Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":81385,"logo_path":null,"name":"Red Production","origin_country":"RS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Subspecies V: Blood Rise","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
