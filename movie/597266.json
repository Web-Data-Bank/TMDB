Katie Lee was a spitfire activist, river goddess and folk-singing warrior for wild places. And when she passed away at the age of 98, she left behind a legacy as big as the Grand Canyon. This short film pays homage to a life shaped by redrock canyons, sinuous rivers, monkey-wrenching mischief and uninhibited passion.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":73321,"logo_path":null,"name":"Felt Soul Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Katie","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
