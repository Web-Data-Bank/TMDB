This naturally led to the doorstep of another friend and mentor, Albert Falzon and the film became more about connection, creativity and friendship, about surfing, being happy, and living simply.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u7G69g753ePtUm4sbE34ZrvBOrR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-12-20","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thank You Mother","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
