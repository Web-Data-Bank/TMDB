Daphni Leef, a young video editor, pitches a tent in Tel Aviv’s famous Rothschild Boulevard as a protest against the exorbitant cost of living in the city. Within days, thousands of people across the country follow suit, and create a national movement spearheaded by the charismatic and articulate Leef. Six years later, Leef revisits the events of that summer, which, though they did not bring about a significant change in policy, had a momentous impact on public awareness in Israel, and on her private life. As Israel finds itself once again in turmoil, Before My Feet Touch the Ground is a reminder of the power of hope and solidarity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fSdGYHX14Fx0M84sl2posHFREpT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Before My Feet Touch The Ground","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
