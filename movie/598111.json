As LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender) issues remain politically sensitive, in addition to China’s strict media censorship, the film festival has encountered enormous difficulties in its development. During the past ten years, the festival venue has shifted from the western suburb of the city to the eastern suburb of the city, and from the city to the countryside. In 2011 it went back to the city and took the strategies of the ‘guerilla warfare’ because of government intervention and censorship. Based on the footages recorded and collected by each year’s organization committee, the film interviewed the committee members and let them tell the stories of the festival and of themselves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3EF4BZNHCijwIJTF3hKQHNo8S6A.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Our Story - 10 years Guerrilla Warfare of Beijing Queer Film Festival","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
