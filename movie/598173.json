The film traces the cultural conditions which led to the flowering of disco, the founding of West End Records and the Paradise Garage and, eventually, the onslaught of AIDS and its devastating effect on the musical and gay communities of New York City. Yet, like disco itself, it is primarily celebratory in nature. Randy Jones, Junior Vasquez and Louis Vega contribute, among many others. This evocative work will interest anyone who has danced to anything, ever.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fsfdkH6bQLMeGPRi5qIdYfIJIIt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Godfather of Disco","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":1}
