Bush","overview":"The laughter. The tears. The “Oh, no, did he really just say that?” moments. Join Comedy Central as we take a loving look back at our 43rd President’s reign and salute him as only we can. Relive your favorite “Dubya” memories from the past eight years with the help of classic episodes from South Park, L’il Bush, That’s My Bush, and more. Given all the comedy he’s provided us throughout the years, it’s only fair we repay him! Don’t let ol’ Bush down, now! Love him or hate him, you’ll certainly laugh with him (or more likely at him) watching this ultimate tribute DVD.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cmgHBFWHEktg8ROGCWv1XT7FDYB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-10-21","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Thanks for the Memories!","title":"Comedy Central Salutes George W.
