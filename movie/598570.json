One day his wife asks him to sign the divorce papers. From shock, he escapes to alcohol, finding himself one night in Tokyo’s gay district, Shinjuku Ni-chōme, where his fateful meeting awaits with Yūtaka, a beautiful twink. Yūtaka makes a living from live sex webcams with men, but his dream is to become an anime creator. Yūtaka however is tortured because he still hadn't come out to his father who collapsed from illness. Kōhei and Yūtaka both carry a cross. They hesitate but can't stop being drawn to each other as if they need each other. The two fall for each other, even at times hurting the other. Kōhei however begins to struggle about what it means \"to love somebody\" and questions his \"sexuality\", through his contacts with different personalities in the gay district. Meanwhile, Yūtaka encounters his gay ex Atsushi, and starts to realize he will never be able to be with Kōhei, who is gay-for-pay.","popularity":1.851,"poster_path":"/twZlc7zWzHhYbMYfuhgfkgADaGN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":137392,"logo_path":null,"name":"キャナル","origin_country":""},{"id":137393,"logo_path":null,"name":"モバコン株式会社","origin_country":""},{"id":137394,"logo_path":null,"name":"株式会社ネクシブ","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2019-07-26","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"I want to live my life being me.","title":"Athlete","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":13}
