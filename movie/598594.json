But that night might not only be the end of the year, it might also be the end of her relationship with Nanni, a beekeeper from the city. The looming separation remains a mystery for the woman: she doesn’t understand the reasons for it and fruitless hours have been spent talking it over with evasive Nanni, who seems to consider their relationship an obstacle to his freedom. But when faced with another woman’s pain, Arianna manages to find the strength within herself to carry on.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/b7v0l40NuysbJaKVbmAa0Wbk5xm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":139527,"logo_path":null,"name":"Axelotil - Pablo","origin_country":""},{"id":192706,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sciù Film","origin_country":""},{"id":192707,"logo_path":null,"name":"L'Unico Cinema","origin_country":""},{"id":192708,"logo_path":null,"name":"MEDIACONTENTS Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2012-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Arianna","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
