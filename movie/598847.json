It was a perfectly fine match but it had little chance of being better than the two matches that came before it as while both have a lot of spunk they aren't on the same level as Nakajima, Fujimoto, Sakura, etc. Yuuka in particular is still growing, seems like a bit of a stretch to put her in the main event of their biggest show but they must see a lot in her down the road. The emotion was there by the wrestlers and Sera has gotten a mean streak recently, but the transitions were shaky and I never brought into Yuuka having a chance of winning. Solid and fun, but that is about as far as it went.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rZkReJUbpu2TYHRykFH4ORDULs2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118039,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ice Ribbon","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2018-08-05","revenue":15332,"runtime":184,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ice Ribbon New Ice Ribbon #902 ~ Ryogoku KFC Ribbon","video":true,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
