Inspired by practices more or less close to magic, she tries to create two characters that will be part of herself. She will be able to live without being alone, while fleeing the external reality. But little by little, the two beings that she created appear to be detached from her, as if the figure three could not agree to the harmony of the group. Her fantasies seem to turn against her, increasing her sense of isolation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5P65mXgdvL4aTtl23LXP3iIql2F.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1977-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stagnation","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
