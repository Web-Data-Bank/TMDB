Many excuses lie between each and every couple, when they look back the distance created during the long years in which they took each other for granted... Love Letters sent from husbands to wives and from wives to husbands, quietly voice their unspoken appreciation for each other over the years that they have shared. The original idea comes from the postcard project \"Love Letters at Sixty\" which has brought a wave of sympathy to the precious emotions shared by many married couples.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/utJaaSmZrUYYrw1KJ8kFwscC62s.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":192,"logo_path":"/93eAKlnQecDdMtucfOprzcjMw9V.png","name":"Shochiku","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2009-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":129,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dear My Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
