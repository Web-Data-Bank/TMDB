If they were together, the kiss that she seeks would have been lost.  In the short film, the image narrates some facts and the sounds illustrate others – two possible paths from a gesture that changes everything.  By image: Alma dared to speak with Duna, they started a relationship, they were together. But after a while they argue and separate. Alma ends alone.  By sound: Alma regrets not having dared to speak with Duna, believing that they had been together forever. Alma still has the memory of Duna in her memory, but one day she meets a person who really loves her.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jZRAakGB9QtlMpIZaHJ5L6XglyJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Alma regrets not having touched the person she loves, but nevertheless, maybe that was the best thing.
