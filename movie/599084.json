During Excellence, Cherry Bomb had a broken collarbone during her match against Candice Lerae and as the name implies, this show is a fundraiser to pay the costs of the operation. On paper, the program is a bit empty with a tailless and unrelated 10-man tag, a defense of the CZW team titles and two other games with little interest, but we also have Bates defending the Spirit Title against Solo Darling and the main event sees Jessicka Havok and Matt Tremont team up against Allysin Kay and Pepper Parks who will have his girlfriend Cherry Bomb at the ring.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":285543,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"CZW/WSU Cherry T","video":true,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
