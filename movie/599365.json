But extraction sites are dwindling and what little gold that remains is harder and harder to mine. However, there is a place where you can still find vast quantities of gold. Underwater archaeology has revealed that 3 million shipwrecks litter the ocean floor, 3,500 of which sunk with cargoes of ’precious metals’ onboard.

With today’s technology, this gold is in reach.","popularity":1.627,"poster_path":"/gt7ADGQv8qegmva8pEM0cRGiO6H.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117855,"logo_path":null,"name":"Via Découvertes Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2019-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sunken Eldorado: The New Underwater Gold Rush?","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
