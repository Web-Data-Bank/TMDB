That year, the National Brotherhood of Skiers formed as a way to bring black skiers together to ski, celebrate and build community. With its annual summits and thriving youth organizations, the NBS has grown into a well-loved ski establishment. Along with torching the myth that black people don’t ski, the NBS continues to engender the next generation of black skiers. “It’s a beautiful sport,” one young participant says. “And I wish it was more accessible to everyone. I guess that’s where our ski club comes in.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":117962,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wild Confluence Media","origin_country":""},{"id":117963,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Wilder Studio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-02-21","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brotherhood of Skiing","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
