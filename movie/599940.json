The ensemble explodes traditional gender roles, pushing the limits of what drag and burlesque can  be. But more than that, they are a tight-knit family of outsiders who welcome queer audiences into their world and create a safe, tantalizing space where everyone can be themselves. The film introduces diverse members of the collective and sprinkles in a generous helping of delicious live performances.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/AaaWsBVhdKMaq1c0xyPOjqv8Z9i.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Night at Switch n' Play","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
