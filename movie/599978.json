In the early 1980â€™s, a small group of dedicated Bay Area headbangers shunned the hard rock of MTV and Hollywood hairspray bands in favor of a more dangerous brand of metal that became known as thrash! From the tape trading network to the clubs to the record stores and fanzines, director Adam Dubin reveals how the scene nurtured the music and the music spawned a movement.  Murder In The Front Row is told through powerful first person testimony and stunning animation and photography. The film is a social study of a group of young people defying the odds and building something essential for themselves.  Featuring interviews with Metallica, Megadeth, Slayer, Anthrax, Exodus, Testament, Death Angel, Possessed and many more! Narrated by Brian Posehn.","popularity":2.811,"poster_path":"/lsVmolhCxoR10YRrJIltTjZTVZt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123114,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bonded By Blood","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When only the music mattered...","title":"Murder in the Front Row: The San Francisco Bay Area Thrash Metal Story","video":false,"vote_average":7.375,"vote_count":8}
