Composed in the 1930s by Kurt Weill and Bertolt Brecht, this is a mordant satire on capitalism and the inexorable industrialisation of a society in which the ultimate crime is not having money. In twenty scenes the authors tell the story of a city lost in the middle of a desert and run by three thugs; in Mahagonny food, sex, gambling and violence rule supreme.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4uQasG1aKVaTtGtqwJH5TlHMqA4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71879,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bel Air Classiques","origin_country":""},{"id":71999,"logo_path":null,"name":"Teatro Real de Madrid","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2011-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":138,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
