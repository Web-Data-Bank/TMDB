Their work is risky and dangerous, potentially fatally so, as they thrust themselves into the middle of chaotic clashes between forces backed by the government (including Inkatha Zulu warriors) and those in support of Mandela's African National Congress.","popularity":7.125,"poster_path":"/xyBDhcgxyffS7uomHDLIuvNwvd9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":719,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Foundry Partners","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2011-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Xhosa","iso_639_1":"xh","name":""},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Afrikaans","iso_639_1":"af","name":"Afrikaans"},{"english_name":"Zulu","iso_639_1":"zu","name":"isiZulu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sometimes you get too close","title":"The Bang Bang Club","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":147}
