Ajiep is also the name of a small village in the south of Sudan, with its school, a village chief, a market... and widespread famine. In the wake of the devastation caused by the war, tens of thousands of people have been uprooted by the North-South fighting and have found refuge near Ajiep, but have no food supplies. A team of \"Médecins sans frontières\" is trying to limit this human catastrophe. The rhythm of life is dictated by the search for food and survival : airdrops of cereals, vaccination campaigns, distribution of food...
