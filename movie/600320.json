But her American aviator boyfriend, Barry Blake (John Boles), is flying to her rescue. He does just that but, alas, they are quickly captured by a gang of outlaws. Possibly the many expensive pieces of jewelry she has gathered from the many male friends she has made along the way, including El Presidente, captured the outlaws' attention.","popularity":0.841,"poster_path":"/5LqxQSg6Pngey4X94AOMON44s0Z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5,"logo_path":"/71BqEFAF4V3qjjMPCpLuyJFB9A.png","name":"Columbia Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1928-07-25","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Virgin Lips","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
