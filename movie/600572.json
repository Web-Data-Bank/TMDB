Mark Berger was an actor in the Meredith Monk company and the House, from 1971 to 1974, and he uses an improvisation technique in this vision of interaction painter/subject, filmmaker/actor, artist/artist. Mark Berger’s camera records and interviews a relationship between himself and Meredith Monk, in the same way that Meredith Monk’s music as soundtrack, is a fundamental and structural aspect of film material editing. The shooting, like the painting of a portrait, was executed in a number of sessions, over a period of several weeks.’ A.
