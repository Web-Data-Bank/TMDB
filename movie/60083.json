Alilo has left his home to pick up an important suitcase for his employer. Unfortunately, he has lost the Parisian address. Fortunately, his cousin Mok, emigrated there several years before with his middle-class family before and is able to act as a guide. Mok, an aspiring rap singer, comes from a middle-class family, but chooses to live on his own in the dilapidated deteriorating 18th district, known as 'Moskova.' Mok characterizes the place as a haven for artists and intellectuals, but it is plainly just a Third World slum filled with tightly knit and colorful neighbors. Mok and Alilo have many interesting, some tragedy-tinged adventures over the five days it takes them to find the suitcase.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/lN89M44DOo3lZTpOGm5JYD79gMN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3883,"logo_path":null,"name":"JBA Production","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":792,"logo_path":"/cRhBQP1FFNugNxKkO1pUgeD2Rkr.png","name":"RTBF","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":18689,"logo_path":null,"name":"Flash Back Audiovisuel","origin_country":"DZ"},{"id":16366,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Sept Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":11773,"logo_path":"/8fCjsqh43LbPV6pm3SfR5Jx64GU.png","name":"Artémis Productions","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":790,"logo_path":"/k0MnHFovKIeev0ANR0Ww6HO6tfF.png","name":"Samsa Film","origin_country":"LU"},{"id":29651,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cléa Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","name":"Algeria"},{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"LU","name":"Luxembourg"}],"release_date":"1996-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Salut cousin !","video":false,"vote_average":4.4,"vote_count":11}
