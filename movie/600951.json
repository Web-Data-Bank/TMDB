The heat of Arles on a hot summer, antique statues, stones damaged by the wind and faces of old women and people in the crowd of the amphitheater are contrasting with the black bull's painful death during the corrida. All these images are becoming the light, and beauty of the film, which is an ode to a place that will always stay in Guirao's soul.","popularity":1.106,"poster_path":"/rkZfxdHjkgujB2e8cly5lu2Lr8t.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Arles dolorosa","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
