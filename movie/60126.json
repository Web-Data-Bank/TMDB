PRESS START 2 CONTINUE also adds fan favorite characters from the \"Press Start Adventures\" animated web series including the sardonic vampire lord Vlad (David S. Humphrey, Sonic Adventure 2 & Jack Keane), sinister succubus Morgan Le Slay, and white-haired assassin Scarthcaroth. Web personalities Noah Antwiler, Stuart Ashen, Lindsey \"Z\" Briggs, and X-Strike Studios' Tim Ekkebus & Rory O’Boyle also join the cast.","popularity":0.764,"poster_path":"/r72ZfVQIzfCEv6GgLqwfmAZNwxy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4754,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dark Maze Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2011-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Press Start 4 in Japan","title":"Press Start 2 Continue","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":2}
