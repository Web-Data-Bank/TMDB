The historical and international dimension seems therefore obvious to answer this question that sounds like an uppercut against the white heteropatriarchal mainstream culture. Series of short movies and news stories extracts (1912 to 1995), punctuated by interviews of lesbian figures over the whole world. Nathalie Magnan has created a visual shock presenting the lesbian culture in all its forms throughout the 20th century: merry appropriation and fierce repackaging of images produced by the mainstream culture.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mX9kql6DDsHGB52yKi9p70Howmr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lesborama","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
