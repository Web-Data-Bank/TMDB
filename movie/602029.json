The two birds are out for a leisurely stroll, playing music together and taking selfies until a hungry cat attempts to spoil their fun. After several unique and imaginative evasive maneuvers, the birds pelt the cat with apple bombs. The film is one of the jewels of the cartoon: the Czech tradition, Disney anthropomorphism and innovative pre-electronic music score.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":2329,"logo_path":null,"name":"Krátký film Praha","origin_country":"XC"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","name":"Czechoslovakia"}],"release_date":"1965-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"Birds that flew only when they were in danger\"","title":"Strange Birds","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
