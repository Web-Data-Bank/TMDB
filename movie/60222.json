The seven crew members venture outside their own galaxy to explore other star system in search of a new planet large enough to sustain 6 billion people. The few habitable planets encountered are ultimately abandoned either because they are already occupied (emphasizing the wrongdoing of invading other civilizations and cultures), or because upon closer inspection they are found to have other problems (cow-sized mosquitoes, high radiation levels, dog overpopulation, unsuitable living environment, ...).","popularity":1.42,"poster_path":"/eCan91bSlSMmRmhXFcfK4AZIZDj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12567,"logo_path":"/3DyEznBXXfh3cvp5MCJXWH4gzhi.png","name":"TVA Films","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":15585,"logo_path":"/ePyhT2loUXRIv7SZ6LIlvKllsdP.png","name":"Zone3","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2004-04-09","revenue":2500000,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dans une galaxie près de chez vous, le film","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":12}
