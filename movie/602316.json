However, the equally important protagonist of the play \"Don't Bet on the English\" - the protagonist who is both inside and outside them - is one of the essential demons of human nature: a passion for gambling, more precisely betting. An emerging form of this obsessive passion is, for Djurdjevic's heroes, betting on the results of matches of various national football leagues.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yEL3ONM3y7nLawBAnIaJRGuHtkA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":63904,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fakultet Dramskih Umetnosti (FDU)","origin_country":"RS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"}],"release_date":"2018-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don't Bet on the Brits","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
