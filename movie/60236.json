As this plan has failed, Pokrovsky assisted by some terrorists organizes a hostage taking in a Moscow circus (very similar to Moscow theater hostage crisis in real life) in order to return to Russia, acting as a saver of the hostages during negotiations. However, he fails to do so. The movie also depicts the Pankisi Gorge in Georgia as a place where an important Islamic militant hides, which was a common allegation by Russian authorities in real life around that time, and depicts destruction of a base of terrorists and allies of Pokrovsky in Qatar which might hint at the assassination of Zelimkhan Yandarbiev. Overall, the movie was widely considered propaganda.","popularity":1.186,"poster_path":"/v1A2Y2eo2rPs7MlMEPhKX11L8JF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21702,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Master","origin_country":""},{"id":21703,"logo_path":null,"name":"Top Line Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2004-12-09","revenue":4385278,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Countdown","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":13}
