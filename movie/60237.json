Shot on location in Las Vegas, Nevada, Rank takes us from the ranch to the arena for the struggle of the three highest-ranking bull riders competing for the title of PBR World Champion. The three contenders: Justin McBride, a third generation bull rider; Mike Lee, 21 year-old born-again Christian and 34 year-old Brazilian Adriano Moraes, already a two-time PBR World Champion, who has been riding since the age of 18 and is now in the twilight of his bull riding career. This documentary brings the reality of this hazardous sport into focus for the first time. From preparations to ride through severe injuries and finally, victory for one: a gold belt buckle and a check for one million dollars.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/m6cVAPYoCGnwLcunMwWldY4LxCY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":2485,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"8 seconds, 1 champion","title":"Rank","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
