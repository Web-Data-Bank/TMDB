Dennis Bowers falls in the former camp. He grew up playing handball on that intersection and although he can no longer afford to live there, he still comes back every week to play on the same wall at age 50 that he did at age 12.  Even if he doesn’t live in the neighborhood, it’ll always be his corner.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gQbySPsrbcUTrJIoHCglzKoTnBH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fishtown Soldier","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
