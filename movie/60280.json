However, when Johnny falls in with gambler Demon, Fanny gets sent packing. Johnny takes up with Demon's sister Curvy, and Fanny is left alone and seems to lose her mahjong-playing skills. Luckily, she receives additional training from her mahjong mentor Three Tiles, who also schooled Auntie Fei, as well as sexy player-in-training First Love. With the aid of her mahjong sisters, brother, plus Auntie Fei's husband Chi Mo Sai, Fanny regroups in time to take on Curvy, Demon, and Johnny at a climactic mahjong tournament.","popularity":1.715,"poster_path":"/xgNp9RFkJUBluICI9gm4eCCNoOt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102055,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mega-Vision Productions Limited (MVP)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2005-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kung Fu Mahjong 2","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":5}
