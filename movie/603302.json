Hungarian migrant and entrepreneur John Kaldor, who initiated this monumental work, has said “it all started with a stale sandwich, in Christo's studio in 1968 New York.” Now, Project 34 (by Asad Raza) is about to be unveiled, and UK artist Michael Landy is designing the exhibition to celebrate 50 years of Kaldor Public Art Projects.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ggWVqT8faivUPBm6zo08TSCBADG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":41577,"logo_path":"/6tkgqMVglDM5XFY1DWXVEQ4WZvV.png","name":"Felix Media","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2019-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It All Started With a Stale Sandwich","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
