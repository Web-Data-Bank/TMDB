Powerful interviews with feminist leaders including bell hooks, Gloria Steinem, and Urvsahi Vaid are intercut with documentary sequences to engagingly explore the past and present status of the women’s movement. Discussing the unique contributions of second wave feminism, they explore their racial, economic and ideological differences and shared vision of achieving equality for women. Anessential component of women’s studies curricula, My Feminism introduces feminism’s key themeswhile exposing the cultural fears underlying lesbian baiting, backlash, and political extremism.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gkR7DNlqUFAAwDpkY1730r8aoEx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Feminism","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":2}
