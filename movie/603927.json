One summer, one year or one friendship. Small stations from Vologda to Nizhny Novgorod, from a Russian EDM festival to an architecture exhibition in Kiev. Everything that made dozens, if not hundreds of thousands of people feel inspired with the art of this gawky, always smiling guy with a heavy backpack is not said out loud, but you can still feel it in each frame. Honesty, natural charisma, and kindness make Antokha MC not only the new hero of the music industry, but also a person, who is the main hero of this film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hajs56bU2nhwOIIg9o2FfXMO8Dg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102895,"logo_path":"/l7vxt0fHlxH0mgPScm1a2Sv4ZZS.png","name":"Stereotactic","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2019-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heel-and-toe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
