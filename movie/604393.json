We witness the friendly relationship between workers from both countries, who are jointly involved in the construction of the cotton spinning mill in Homs.  In impressive pictures the exoticism of the environment and the mentality of the Syrian hosts is shown. At the same time it becomes clear that the workers from the GDR become 'ambassadors of the GDR' through their collegial behaviour and good work.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/z9kLiDFS3XA1nflLlQqR6QdVFWH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135493,"logo_path":null,"name":"Syrische Nationale Filmorganisation (SAR)","origin_country":""},{"id":72750,"logo_path":"/nvDTUVfgu0KEDs8wuod74e6sLM6.png","name":"DEFA Studio f√ºr Dokumentarfilme","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"SY","name":"Syrian Arab Republic"}],"release_date":"1971-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Syrien auf Montage","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
