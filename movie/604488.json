Within this twilit demi monde, which may be entirely a figment of the dandy’s own fevered imagination, clothes take on a heightened importance: as prized commodities and as treasured, almost talismanic objects. This closed circuit of desire and display turns increasingly claustrophobic, as if tracing a compulsive, repetitive groove in the protagonist’s mind; culminating, in a self-consciously solipsistic flourish, in a cool 360-degree pan round the walls of Leckey’s flat.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Parade","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
