Tim has walked out on Katherine after finding her in bed with a younger man. Victor, possessive and longing for commitment, has been thrown out by his older lover, Neal. Both Tim and Vic seek solace in a café, where Vic overhears Tim confiding in a friend about his breakup with Katherine. When Tim leaves, desperate and a little drunk, Vic follows him home. Though they are strangers, he manages to talk his way into Tim’s apartment. Once inside, Vic claims to be a recruiter for the devil, willing to return Katherine in exchange for Tim’s soul. Angered, Tim suspects this is just a tasteless prank and demands that he leave. But what appears to be a “prank” leads to murder.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Recent Sorrows","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
