There is nothing simple about Catherine Saalfieldâ€™s Infidel, however, as the film uncovers and repositions layers of myth about female beauty, the function of racism in standardizing our ideals, and the necessity of female self-consciousness in a scheme that demands both conformity and uniqueness. Partly autobiographical, and partly extracted from collective experience, this jumpy, tightly crafted narrative reconstructs the process behind the formulation of self-image.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Infidel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
