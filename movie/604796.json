What started as a one person strike soon gained global momentum. We follow Greta and the organisers of the school strikes for climate as they are cementing a worldwide movement ahead of their first global protest that took place on March 15th, 2019. It was the biggest climate strike in history with up to 1.6 million students in more than 125 countries.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ALclMBXq1xVmtJd29QZUBrIWS8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17209,"logo_path":"/khOQX3iJuSmaFWrL3w4LijbtnJZ.png","name":"VICE Media","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Skipping school to save the planet","title":"Make the World Greta Again","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
