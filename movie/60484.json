We are in 1930s working-class neighborhood in Copenhagen. In a backyard apartment, we meet the little working-up of small Gustav Adolf (Benjamin Rothenborg Vibe) who has great respect for his father, Axel (Erik Clausen). Father has a very lively gab and is always ready to tell a story from her exciting life - often from the time he was on the big Argentine pampas.","popularity":0.651,"poster_path":"/1Ouayng72U9lNCdiZQZRj1D7a8g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":235,"logo_path":"/obOynoztBEhDNfHsDXBqOuQLAZk.png","name":"Nordisk Film Denmark","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":6181,"logo_path":"/eaQ7or8IoEmPfgmQiU2C5lVZkxS.png","name":"SF Studios","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":3676,"logo_path":"/mel4PnFPw1LuxgzUJzoh7VxpIRq.png","name":"ASA Film Production","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"1991-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Great Day on the Beach","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":9}
