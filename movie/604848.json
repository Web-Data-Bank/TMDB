I film to remember: the end of a summer, of a family, a last trip to Vermont before a separation, grandparents getting older.... I film impromptu, dissolving and fading in the camera. At night I hand-develop the film in a beaker. It sticks together and stains, leaving traces and holes that only add to the nostalgia. I leave the film as is, adding only some improvised music, which by its minor harmonies and discordances goes well with the faded, stained pictures.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pjpg2uQqoaBNZ7O1FFteq5M7esx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"End Memory (Impromptu)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
