She studies a textbook of the French language, which she used to have a thorough command of, but unfortunately let slide. She hardly reads anymore, either, which she thinks rather stupid of herself. Her window on the world is her television, which she briskly comments on. The bleach-blond anchor woman is very sharp, but her favourite is newsreader Niko. She addresses him as if he were her roommate and cannot keep her hands off the screen. He excites her even more than the fighter jets, volcanic eruptions, protesters, politicians, friendly Turks and black athletes that are the items of Niko's newscast. The Box is a reflection in miniature format about old age and one-way communication in our media-dominated society.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/156OnbxiGogMj0jTDafdTW0rkU1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Box","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
