By admitting to being both homosexual and ill, Ratti was touching on two fundamental taboos sex and death.  The very title to Acklin's film derives from her subject's comment \"I like living, I like dying\", which suggests at the very least, a contradictory character, prepared to voice more than one standard view on a given matter.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-06-29","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Living and Dying","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
