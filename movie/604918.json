The show takes us back to a memorable time in pop music and in Neil Diamond’s career - while also giving us music that is as fresh and timeless today as it was then.  The early hits are here, in rousing and intimate interpretations: ‘Cherry, Cherry,’ ‘Song Sung Blue,’ ‘Sweet Caroline,’ ‘I Am...I Said,’ ‘Cracklin’ Rosie,’ and more. But Neil also introduces songs from what was then his new album - and is now considered a classic - the benchmark ‘Beautiful Noise,’ produced by rocker Robbie Robertson.\r And Neil gets across the footlights, bringing the big audience to its feet, inciting clapping and singing along, and pulling two of the best-known stars of the era, singer Helen Reddy and the actor Henry Winkler (then an icon as TV’s ‘Fonzie’) up on stage to sing with him.\r An amazing trip back in time with one of our most enduring singers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hBw5Pn5muh5xMYj0jFib44tpqRK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1502,"logo_path":"/ywjcvHUiKxv7cYsestkONF8LieH.png","name":"NBC","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-02-21","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Neil Diamond : Live At the Greek Theatre 1976","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
