Copies circulate in Palestine, eerily akin to a black ski mask. A group of youth wear them at the site of a destroyed Palestinian village in Israel. Becoming other, becoming anonymous, in this accidental moment of ritual and myth. Initiating a series of trips to possess and almost be possessed by these strangely living sites of erasure and wreckage. Only now, returning to the site of destruction as the very site from which to cast a new projection that palpably evokes the potential of an unrealised time, not bound by the here and now or there and then. A parallel time that is not occupied, a virtual time that is not ‘our’ time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3NaNkDHcqjXMPNYV3rtp5NHmWc9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"And Yet My Mask Is Powerful","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
