When a woman at her funeral proclaims that the dead woman called her cellphone, Vasil seeks out the help of a well-known psychic in order to try to contact his wife. His son Pavel tries to bring him to his senses, but Vasil stubbornly insists on doing things his own way… Following the internationally successful The Lesson and Glory, Grozeva and Valchanov return with an intimate family drama about the difficulties of connecting with those close to us. As the picture slowly gathers momentum, its story unfolds many of the carefully arranged absurd or comic situations typical for the Bulgarian filmmaking duo.","popularity":1.723,"poster_path":"/vOPfERSnQ0vDVIGw6L7PUOTxqlB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51099,"logo_path":null,"name":"Abraxas Film","origin_country":""},{"id":8943,"logo_path":"/ap6EIp6w76kOSkA65Lbk7ICTjc0.png","name":"Graal","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BG","name":"Bulgaria"},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2020-08-21","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bulgarian","iso_639_1":"bg","name":"български език"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Father","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":7}
