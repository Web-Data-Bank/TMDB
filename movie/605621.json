Stylistically, it combines elements of Grimm's fairy tales as interpreted by Disney, German Expressionist silent films, the modern documentary, and \"arty\" porn filtered through heavy use of Jungian allegorical archetypes. The film is scored to a continuous dance mix and intended to take audiences on a phantasmagorical trip. It's a new step in a long tradition of underground 'queer' cinema as a leader in the evolution of the cinematic art form.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A7CewlY4dTCVQuls12wQGaLHeWe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Schwarzwald: The Movie You Can Dance To","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
