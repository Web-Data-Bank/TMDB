She is the tarot equivalent of the Queen of Hearts from the deck of playing cards, who also presented to me in a dream as part of myself. The Queen of Cups is associated with the water signs of the horoscope – Pisces, Cancer, and Scorpio (for those interested in astrology, I am a Cancer sun with Scorpio rising). I shot the film at Spurn Point where the North Sea meets the Humber River, while artist in residence at the Three Points of Contact residency.
