A vision of women enjoying the sea in Saltburn in North Yorkshire becomes a celebration of the material nature of film. The silver salts in film that react to light also react to the metallic salts in film toners, and a multi-coloured seascape emerges from the salt of the sea. Filmed on a part of the beach that was once notorious for shipwrecks, Salt is a love letter to film and to the churning, crashing, passionate sea.\" — M.J.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Salt","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
