Filmmakers Negin Kianfar and Daisy Mohr offer filmed portraits of three Iranian transsexuals and how they live their lives. Mahtab is a man in the outside world, but lives as a woman at home, which angers his father and confuses his mother, though they've come to accept his decision to have a sex change. Saye, meanwhile, is a woman trapped in a man's body who has not been as lucky as Mahtab - after repeated violence from her father, she was banished from the family home, and now shares an apartment with her lover, Afshin. Afshin is also a transsexual, but since becoming a man, he insists Saye stay home and observe the cultural restrictions that apply to women in a fundamentalist Muslim society.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Birthday","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
