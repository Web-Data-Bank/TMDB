Again Onishi brings together the couple’s problems, nature and brutalism, set against a colour-changing skyline or in small apartments. The structure of architecture and the one of nature. A cat hiding behind a car. While it all turns out to be a drama of killing and brutalism against women. Travelling or hiding is never easy on that little island.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lj9HKctMq74FfFIYByw0CsawnMl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1997-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zetcho (The Acme)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
