Projected, they generate a fluid stream of organic images in a carefully controlled post-cubist  space comparable to the work of painters like Jackson Pollock. Viewed one frame at a time,  (which is the way much of the footage is shot), they recall the rich lines and textures of such  master etchers as Rembrandt. Wood's use of camera movement during the exposure of each  individual frame - like drawing - together with the illusion of movement in projection make his  films both beautiful and unique.\" -Bill Judson, Curator of Film, Museum of Art, Carnegie Institute.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fMZujjRdlNRGnTMqZTtGWOoEJmR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1977-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Molten Shadow","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
