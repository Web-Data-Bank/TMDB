The narrator, an aroma specialist, describes a drug derived from a mythical flower with miraculous properties that might produce empathy in humans, enabling them to know what is being felt by a pink river dolphin or an angry teenager. Through her work, Yi explores ways in which our senses are culturally conditioned. Blending elements of documentary, dream and bio-fiction, The Flavor Genome anticipates a renewal in the perception of nature influenced by new scientific and technological discoveries.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Flavor Genome","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
