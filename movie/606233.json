The former Progress announcer, Jimmy Barnett, has been sharing his memories of a show from May 26th, 1988. Last year he was kind enough to offer his recollections of a very early PROGRESS from way back in May of 1978 (PROGRESS even found the footage in their vault), and it's a rare treat to get details of another historical show from a man on the inside.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1VHe81Zs2W0vIA2tXOt23CxsEkp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73630,"logo_path":"/lyFZFpFRF94LioMNgi7GUYzUKNS.png","name":"PROGRESS","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":138,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"PROGRESS Chapter 89: 26th May 1988","video":true,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
