Think again. Meet Dan and Jeanine Dewerson. The only spark in their bedroom is from the wall socket. Their daughter's best friend is her iPad. Dan's not going to take it anymore and plans a quiet, relaxing weekend in a remote mountain town. No kids, no phones, no social media, only clean fresh air and lots of romance. But what starts as the perfect weekend quickly becomes disastrous with unearthly encounters, strong edibles, cranky locals, and a pesky one-eyed dog. Without GPS to guide them or social media to stave off their boredom, Dan and Jeanine are forced to reconnect with each other. Can a \"digital detox\" really save their marriage and their sanity?","popularity":6.705,"poster_path":"/tFL9lRtVUEmsVcggoag0u4H14mJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39043,"logo_path":null,"name":"Traveling Picture Show Company (TPSC)","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unplugging","video":false,"vote_average":5.091,"vote_count":22}
