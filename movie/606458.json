Until today, the European Institutions have not given a clear answer. The EU has still to recognize water as a human right, as the UN did in 2010. Up To The Last Drop follows the money and the corporate interests during a period of four years in thirteen cities of six EU countries. It’s a documentary film about water that reflects contemporary European values and the quality of the current European democracy.","popularity":0.659,"poster_path":"/8hyLLoQ4fEFwyA5ydYZBdhayyfA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7255,"logo_path":"/aHu0SirjV9Mi0OrlnFWqZwy50wW.png","name":"EPT","origin_country":"GR"},{"id":13837,"logo_path":null,"name":"K.G Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":62166,"logo_path":null,"name":"Small planet","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2018-05-06","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Up to the Last Drop: The Secret Water War in Europe","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
