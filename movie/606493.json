What results is a piece very different from its predecessor - a visual poem, episodic in nature, made up of travel diaries compiled while working with Patrick. The issue now is the reconciliation and cathartic transformation from a Hemingway biography to a re-consideration of autobiography. The biographer takes us on a journey away from Patrick Hemingway - the cool, controlled persona - to East Vancouver, documenting lives stripped bare of pretension. The scope is broadened. Patrick Hemingway and all things Hemingway become insignificant.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5NptOljsmOYnB4R02ZLg3xrxySY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"human tragedy on a grand scale","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
