After being prescribed a painkiller he was allergic to, Warwick, a thoroughly unlucky college student, decides to enroll in an experimental drug trial as a last ditch effort to relieve the pain of his chronic migraines. The following morning, he begins to notice changes in his demeanor leading him to think he's going crazy.  Strangers tend to agree, his friends are unhelpful, and his absurdly Canadian roommate's odd behavior only adds to his stress. It's only at his breaking point that he realizes that his newfound insanity might not be the work of what's in his head, but rather what's in the little orange bottle.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fQrVWcpdYtGJyE3IPzCTlJzEWcj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":119190,"logo_path":null,"name":"Allied Street Films","origin_country":""},{"id":119191,"logo_path":null,"name":"Poorly Planned Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":119208,"logo_path":null,"name":"Xelastone Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Life's Not A Wheel of Impressions","title":"Warwick","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
