The film was made with the round tube of a 1950s television without scanning; the sinusoidal signals directly controlled the deflection coil, producing Lissajous figures. All the material was tube-powered. The colors were obtained by a disc with six colored sectors which rotated in front of the lens of the Bolex 16mm camera. This material is now in the museum reserves of the Cit√© des sciences et de l'Industrie in Paris.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/AkcutUsFBzrFCNtY1qo7nUrrR52.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1967-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chromophonie","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
