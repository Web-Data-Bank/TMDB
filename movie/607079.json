Reactions range from his mother's earnest bewilderment to the scandalized fury of in-laws. Only wife of 25 years Brenda retrospectively sees signs she'd ignored of the cross-dressing, then hormone-taking \"alter ego\" he managed to keep secret for decades.","popularity":0.627,"poster_path":"/eNsAW28rfQvixtZ5tWvNdsVPAu9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Opposite Sex: Jamie's Story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
