We are in a remote mountain village in Georgia. The light from the projector breaks the darkness: the children's first cinematic experience is about to begin. Among the kids are Iman and Eva, two Muslim girls, for whom the experience becomes a turning point and inspires them to pick up a camera and start filming their daily lives. The girls are growing up in a valley infested by radicalism, where most people live in constant fear that their relatives will sacrifice their lives in the name of God.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xJCHWcaY0wskqmVKWZWIozjScqL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":119297,"logo_path":null,"name":"LuFilms","origin_country":""},{"id":94045,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmpunkt","origin_country":""},{"id":119298,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nushi Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"GE","name":"Georgia"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2018-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Before Father Gets Back","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
