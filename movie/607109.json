Groucho played an \"old movie\" villain, who \"sported a long moustache and was clad in black\", while Chico was probably his \"chuckling [Italian] henchman\". Zeppo portrayed a playboy who was the owner of a nightclub in which most of the action took place, including \"a cabaret, [which allowed] the inclusion of a dance number\". The final shot showed Groucho \"in ball and chain, trudging slowly off into the gloaming\". Harpo, in a rare moment of romantic glory, gets the girl in the end.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":119300,"logo_path":null,"name":"Caravel Comedies","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1921-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Humor Risk","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
