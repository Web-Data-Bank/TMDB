In ‘Packeted Passages’ I filmed with two synchronized cameras and fused the two views in the printing stage into one disintegrated screen space.” – William Raban","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tshiyvH85W7nmrDKorf1bn2Pjbs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Autumn Scenes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
