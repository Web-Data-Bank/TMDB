From the composer of The Flower of Hawaii and Ball at the Savoy comes this ‘football operetta’, a crazy and turbulent sports satire. Paul Abraham’s fiery music is a cocktail of jazz, puszta and operatic melodies, all rounded off with a shot of stadium chanting. Well-known German music cabaret trio Die Geschwister Pfister take on the three leading roles in this new production at the Komische Oper Berlin.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lZSMhJSBPo14NaraMDoafMIniin.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Roxy und ihr Wunderteam","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
