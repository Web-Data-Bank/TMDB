Today, this fascinating white Whale that lives in Arctic and sub-Arctic waters is once again in decline, especially in the St. Lawrence River. Is it due to the loss of sea ice? The growth of ocean shipping? Noise? Contamination? Genetics?  Alongside world-renowned researchers, this documentary in 4K takes us on a major scientific quest that sheds new light on Beluga populations which are fighting for their survival. Over four seasons, we share the daily life of an international group of scientists who study this extraordinary species in its native habitat to better comprehend their existence and understand why they are endangered.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/naxV6CbqHu4gwKK8LB68H8yhUMc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16888,"logo_path":"/di3Bw89NYi83N769K6wYnqqSFHS.png","name":"ZED","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":138005,"logo_path":null,"name":"Productions Nova Média","origin_country":""},{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-12-23","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mystery of the Belugas","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
