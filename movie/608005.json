Most of these films were underwater fantasies, and this one was no exception. Here, Kellerman is Merilla, a mermaid who is the \"Queen of the Sea.\" Not satisfied with being a mermaid, she wants a mortal human body with an immortal soul. She discovers she can achieve this if she saves four human lives.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bDgxDCqMs0DM39KStz14ZfZ6aAt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Queen of the Sea","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
