The girl considers the doll to be very realistic, therefore she associates it with herself, and herself with her mother. So begin the serious experiences of a girl who understands that this doll bought off her. At night, the girl dreams a terrible dream in which the doll embodies all her fears...\r \"Pink Doll\" creates the illusion of a spellbound fall into the abyss of children's dreams, fantasies and nightmares. The sensual effect is achieved by the game of scale and angle, the nervous rhythm of intraframe movement and graphic thickening of reality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ibygeBFqu8GP9M0NhedcdiSBn0A.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pink Doll","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
