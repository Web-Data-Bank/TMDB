Through the resurrection of a music that was forgotten by many and unheard by most, the film explores the life of a former African rock-star, and the excitement around the rediscovery of his music by Western fans, many of whom had yet to be born when his last album was released.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/b8TQwtgxIQC58IITAqDACrFsOUz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"ZM","name":"Zambia"}],"release_date":"2019-05-08","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An African Rock n' Roll Dream","title":"WITCH: We Intend to Cause Havoc","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
