The Men","overview":"It's no secret that stand-up comics are a tortured lot, and in this documentary filmmaker Andrea Meyerson pays special tribute to some of the most talented - and tormented - gay comedians around. While some gay comics seek to refute common stereotypes, others thrive on them. From comedy queen Bruce Vilanch - who has penned the jokes for sixteen Oscar telecasts - to Texas football fan Scott Kennedy - who watches the games for much more than the touchdowns - these are the talented folks who eschew contemporary taboos to take an honest look at everyday gay life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rxdWwNzEFnFE9AJBkiw8fGpu6uj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-02-19","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Laughing Matters...
