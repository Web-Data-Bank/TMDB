Double-projection imagery of the aerial shots of this landscape — at times forming abstract and stereoscope-like compositions — become close-ups on grotesque monuments and sculptures as the camera descends to ground level. Additionally, two iPads both contained within glass domes each play a video of one of two houses that sit directly opposite each other in a residential Topeka neighborhood. One is the headquarters of the infamous Westboro Baptist Church with its anti-LGBTQ signs and other hate-filled rhetoric; the second is the “Equality House”, which was formed later as a direct response, with its rainbow colors and messages of peace and acceptance.\" - Microscope Gallery","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2zWQTVPgNUCDDbWlTMa4tMY7wQK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kansas Atlas","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
