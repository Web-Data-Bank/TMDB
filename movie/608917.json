An old priest with an empty church is full of sorrow. However, he encourages a young priest to go among the people wearing civilian clothes, and try to live in the image of Christ. The young man gets a job as a laborer in the fields. He tries to show Christian charity by his example: he feeds the poor, protects children, turns the other cheek, and helps a fallen woman. He is misunderstood by the people, and discouraged, goes back to the old priest. The fallen woman comes to them: the young manâ€™s kindness to her has moved her to seek forgiveness and a reformed life. The bells ring in celebration of one soul saved.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":13131,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Mutoscope \u0026 Biograph","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1910-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Way of the World","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
