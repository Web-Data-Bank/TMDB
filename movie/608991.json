Raju, Bini, Rai, Bhaskar, Tista, Suman and Sabir come from very different socio-economic backgrounds. Yet, there are certain interconnecting issues of social acceptance and finding a space in the largely hetero-normative social order in each of these diaries which reflect the larger image of how politics of power operate.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tm2rgLmTSLFv1pGbHBpJRlCfwy2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Diaries of Transformation","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
