Each has it's own texture and sees the domestic environment in it's own particular way, one scan at a time. The 'narrator' is taken from the sound of an instructional software disk, which accompanied one of the scanners. This piece is deals with the deliberate misuse/re-purposing of commercial image producing machines and celebrates a slow, individual, low end, approach to the motion picture making process.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ggAYgmnL70Gfl9HxDoiEliGk0uF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Close The Lid Gently","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
