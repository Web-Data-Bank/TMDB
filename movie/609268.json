Made in 1977, it reflected, as well as Soutar's own passion and commitment, the debate then current in the run-up to the 1979 devolution referendum. Forty-odd years later with a second independence referendum in prospect, it has, we believe, a renewed relevance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Garden Beyond","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
