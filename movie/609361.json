For the re-enactment, Knowles, wearing a shirt and a pair of pants, was accompanied by a cameraman and two reporters. A sampling of Knowles's exploits and accomplishments were recreated for the camera, including his tool, clothes, weapon and firemaking techniques, which utilized only existing natural materials and constructs. Also seen are Knowles's battles with wild animals, including bears and wild cats, his adoption of several bear cubs and his trip down raging river rapids in his hand-fashioned birch canoe.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":13133,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1915-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Nature Man: Or, The Struggle for Existence","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
