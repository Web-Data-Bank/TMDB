But something more keeps him running - his own haunting past. Through nostalgic flashbacks we learn of the intimate bond he formed in his youth with Farren McGraw, a fellow 17 year-old farm hand. When Farren dies a mysterious death, Jake feels guilty for not being able to save him. For twenty years he wanders with a broken heart. Like so many times before, Jake settles down for a time in a small roadside settlement in the Owens River Valleyt. Here, a chance encounter with David, a local delivery boy, brings Jake face to face with his own emotional destitution.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kaCWwvkLx7x232DNj85CokBNdb5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Outpost","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
