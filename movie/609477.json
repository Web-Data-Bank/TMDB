His curiosity for people and their fates runs through his extensive film work. For his 70th birthday he has now made 70 new short films. In the first part of the big project, he confronts Thilo Sarrazin with the mayor of Neukölln, Heinz Buschkowsky, and the Turkish lawyer and women's rights activist Seyran Ates; shows a homosexual hustler in Bucharest; gossip reporter Andreas Kurtz, who knows everything about Berlin's celebrities; Rosa's neighbors who live with her dependent brother; Esther Bauer, who survived Auschwitz, and the Berlin comedian Ades Zabel. High on the roofs of Berlin, the gay chimney sweep Alain Rappsilber tells him about his fetish leather meeting Folsom.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gP5NXxbbjKBdv3tnhctgX2LTQ0X.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":999,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rosas Welt – 70 neue Filme von Rosa von Praunheim","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
