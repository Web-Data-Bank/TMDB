The rupture forms a third suburban, autumnal realm. Ariadne1, of New York and played by the artist, decides she wants to disappear, allowing lightning to transport her into a virtual realm. The simulated Ariadne2 is seen with a red lightning scar upon her chestâ€”a trace of the act, which she carries with her back into the live-action scene that concludes the film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rHX7ZMi6y8oOGstsHuS9I0YoTCn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ariadne","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
