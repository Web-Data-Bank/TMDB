Drucker suffered not during the Holocaust, but later during the McCarthy years, when he became a victim of the witch hunt and was suspected in collaboration with the communist regime, from which his family had run away. Together with Drucker, we witness the paradoxical paranoia that used to infect America in those days.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pLkwENaBv5Mb9Xz2mRh3EBItTeB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Archive","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
