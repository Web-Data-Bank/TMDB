Instead, he wants to perform in a hideous one-man show that he wrote. After his attempts to get rid of the role he is stuck in fail, Shmelky falls into despair - until the entire country, brought up on his simple shows, says to him: “In our complicated world the Chosen People very much need a purple puppet who tells them about Mitzvahs.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wTscOscqW1XmGC1zW1h5kHsOPs9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2018-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shmelky","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
