We see: a beautiful mountain landscape and a man moving through it. He is playing the role of The Artist's future son investigating their death. More images follow, and The Artist tries to explain them, but is unsure of their relation to the proposed plot. They feel disconnected not only from the original ideas for the piece, but also from the situation of filming it. More alpine landscape, cartoonishly beautiful, it was all somehow supposed to be about love. The son/protagonist opens a fortune cookie while The Artist explains that they had found it randomly in a bank. Now we see The Artist drawing. They find the aspiration apparent in the drawings embarrassing. To desire, to want, is to make oneself vulnerable.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-12-28","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Utopia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
