Blocked from shooting inside prison walls, the filmmakers ask former inmates, guards and bystanders to describe their experience with the institution. Their feature is a crucial part of a broad constellation of projects – a post-68 vérité wave – in which women, immigrants, factory workers, and other marginalized groups began using film and video to analyze their position within global struggles. Incarceration is one factor that ties these struggles together: “None of us is sure to escape prison,” Foucault wrote in the GIP manifesto, “Today less than ever.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wecVolqEtLqaiuKNAWtmt3S9iTt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-02-26","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les prisons aussi...","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
