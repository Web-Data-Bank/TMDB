The first part, entitled J'explique certaines choses, is in Spanish with French subtitles, and shows us more precisely the lifestyle of a group of Chileans. In Slowly, which forms the second part, we are asked, through Lucia, a young Chilean exile, the problem of integration into a new social environment. Finally, Jours de fer (Steel Blues), the third and only part available in English, is a cruel reminder of the harsh condition of the uprooted man who must find work at all costs to ensure his survival.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lLVvOGKNgSKhJcMkyUyQr6ndEMO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"There is no forgetting","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
