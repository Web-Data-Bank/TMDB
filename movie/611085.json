The young people who come to work in Abidjan often form spontaneous associations for mutual help and entertainment, which are called \"Goumbés\" in Ivory Coast, after the name of a square drum that serves as the rhythmic base to their dance. During a general meeting, the secretary of the association reads the statutes, and it is these statutes that serve as both the backdrop and the commentary of the film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":114154,"logo_path":null,"name":"Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)","origin_country":""},{"id":745,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films de la Pléiade","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1965-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Goumbé des jeunes noceurs","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
