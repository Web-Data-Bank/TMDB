Bucking the trend of the apathetic comedian, his genuine passion for his craft draws audience members into the unique world of Mike Brody: an affable, clever guy whose life is often derailed by his own neurotic, obsessive-compulsive tendencies.  Brody has worked with Jay Pharoah, Dave Attell, Patrice O'Neal, Emo Philips, Joy Behar, Doug Stanhope, Doug Benson, and legendary street performer/madman/savant Wesley Willis.  He is the official event comedian for the SyFy Channelâ€™s TV show Ghost Hunters and has also appeared on the nationally syndicated radio program The Bob & Tom Show as well as The Dan Patrick Show.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1EFplZ3LZ63xKdt9sPyPJw2ZRSr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mike Brody: Not Afraid of Butterflies","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
