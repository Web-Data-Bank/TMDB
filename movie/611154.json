Twin guitars, the strong personality of its singer, harmonies, counterpoints, sharp keyboards and a rabid double bass drum racked the skulls of those who ventured to listen to them live. Without diffusion or support of any kind, they created a mystique and managed to fill clubs, theaters and stadiums, and at the least expected moment, at the peak of their career, they separated. This is the story of El Reloj and its music. Of the innumerable circumstances and problems that got in the way of their different returns, and how they came out on each occasion inspiring several generations of musicians.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eFunfU6yzi5MuYZYAR5FpzEN9nN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alguien más en quien confiar","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
