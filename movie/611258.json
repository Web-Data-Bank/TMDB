The notorious Mistress of the Underworld has finally found a human host, but in order to truly taste freedom and taste the innocent blood she so desires, she must first claim a seventh victim. Now, with the only person standing between the forces of ultimate evil and the destruction of mankind being lowly apprentice exorcist Kujaku, the true battle between the forces of darkness and the forces of light is about to set the world ablaze as never before. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jlf2Zk9zpvSdvtDrLHAmMpsFgkT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4690,"logo_path":"/bQXkraSwoBDVd8xEAOkxGQLBB1S.png","name":"Anime International Company","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1990-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spirit Warrior: A Harvest of Cherry Blossoms","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
