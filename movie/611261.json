The plots of the first three volumes focus on the spirits of key Japanese historical figures being reborn to wreak havoc on modern Japan by taking over the souls of vulnerable young mediums. It is one of the most consistently imaginative series of occult thrillers in Japanese animation and offers the standard hard-edged appeal of the genre--demons, monsters, bloodshed, nudity, possession, etc.--along with an immersion in Japanese cultural history and superior artwork and design.","popularity":0.826,"poster_path":"/RV0XDrtBuxVFZG4D8kwVqdh2lP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4690,"logo_path":"/bQXkraSwoBDVd8xEAOkxGQLBB1S.png","name":"Anime International Company","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1988-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spirit Warrior: Festival of the Ogres Revival","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
