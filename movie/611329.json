Mays has surely been a consistent \"heavy-hitter\" in the realm of tv and film, but for this cinematic drama, she digs deep to get the tears flowing. Directed by first-timer Devon Stewart, this film explores the dynamics of both women empowerment and, to a degree, the depth of empathy.","popularity":0.691,"poster_path":"/s78m2EdNRqkRdN85KKss4deM9ZT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Breathe","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":3}
