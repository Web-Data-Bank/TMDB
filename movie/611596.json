Market obsessions are rendered to their most primal states, flooding a present-day utopia with a nihilistic fixation over death and sexuality, rendering the whole city as a conceptually cannibalistic market of flesh. Market researchers and psychoanalysts watch in indifference as the mental states of their subjects quickly collapse into depressive torpor.","popularity":0.602,"poster_path":"/aeCvWvvW6miVOvq8xvSD5BM5vFn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95914,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mutant Fish Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kafka's Supermarket","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
