For more than 40 years, so-called \"pink\" films have served as both a key source of revenue for the Japanese film industry as well as a launching pad for the careers of such mainstream filmmakers as Kiyoshi Kurosawa. After providing a detailed history of the still-profitable and popular genre through interviews with a variety of behind-the-scenes players and clips from such classic pink films as Fish Bait Boobies, director Fujii shifts his focus to the production of an upcoming pink film to offer a glimpse into the creative and stylistic evolution of the genre.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gmDeph1NkNBwOk0n8wh3b7OInlu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27904,"logo_path":null,"name":"Uplink","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2004-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pink Ribbon","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
