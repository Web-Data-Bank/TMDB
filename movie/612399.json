It isn't a full length performance of course, but still remains interesting. Several of the performances were released as live b-sides on 'Ten Summoner's Tales' era singles. Perhaps of most interest is the live version of Hendrix's 'Purple Haze', a rip-roaring crowd favourite from that tour.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jBIrCnLfXHIHxD72jEongoYoQY0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Soul Cages Concert","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
