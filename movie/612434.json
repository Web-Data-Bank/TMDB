Taken from more than 70 hours of original and archival footage, including rare scenes of Holly Woodlawn, director Vishnu Dass digs deeply into the decadent countercultural and inspiring life of this unheralded multimedia artist of the queer community.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jr4C7oDKMUvIDPVDVmlUD5ZqWGQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Steven Arnold: Heavenly Bodies","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
