Through the flickering vignettes of a schoolboy trauma, visits to a friend at a psychiatric institution and encounters with animals, Ink in Milk exposes the anxious, web-like structures that underpin the tragicomedy of existence. The artist’s narrative is accompanied by a series of schematic, childlike diagrams, line drawings, ink paintings, plasticine animations, and crystalline sculptural forms, punctuated with super 8 film clips. Sometimes these images illustrate the narrative voice as gathered evidence; at other points they are oblique documents, disrupting chains of causality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/k1RCosQqTi5dTlZroZaMtcaePH0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ink in Milk","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
