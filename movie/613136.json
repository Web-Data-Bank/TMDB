It explores my Mummy Case, then the series of works that are based on a modelâ€™s image reflected in a series of mirrors. It shows the game I created where the pieces are glass and mirror geometric forms, moved in relation to each other on three layers. Finally the film passes through some of the Headbox sculptures and Face prints I made, using lifecasts and photographs of my face.\" - Penny Slinger","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9PZVKAP3NF8M0z73ppFX9g9DynU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1969-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"1969 Exhibit","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
