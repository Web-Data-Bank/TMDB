By mid-afternoon on Sunday, when morale is low, songs you know as intimately as your parents’ phone number, played by icons who are very often older than your parents, offer a particularly welcome kind of comfort. But with Kylie, it’s different. She was supposed to play Glastonbury in 2005, she reminds us, back when she was a regular icon, perhaps not yet a living legend. But then, she says, “circumstances” struck: she was diagnosed with breast cancer and had to watch from her bed in Australia, moved by the sight of some bands covering her songs in tribute.","popularity":0.603,"poster_path":"/39yelUk7oNMt9fTlTuw6DUxPfvx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kylie Minogue - Live at Glastonbury 2019","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
