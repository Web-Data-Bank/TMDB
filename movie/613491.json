She lived in almost total isolation for 12 months despite her act of withdrawal triggering controversy both politically and within the media. I Go Further Under incorporates aspects of Jane Cooper's story to delve into an ambivalent space of escape, unpacking the associated experiences of detachment, isolation, surveillance, insanity and severance. It follows the hesitations, reluctance and fragility of leaving here and going elsewhere, away from North, deep into the idea of South.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Go Further Under","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
