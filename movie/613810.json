Anchored in a small marina, the three - a mother, the father and a teenage son - try to manage the small occurrences of a routine different from the usual in a different life. The relationship between the mother and her child is disturbed when a group in a neighbouring boat invites the child to join a small party and the child glimpses a piece of freedom. Through a sensuous look, reflected in the time that the film devotes to the small gestures, this is a melancholy bump over the passage of time and about growth.","popularity":0.602,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2019-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Berço","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
