His name soon became synonymous with social documentary in the U.S. His images of cottonfields, steelmills and industrial towns, and his portraits of unemployed factory workers and their families, provide an invaluable chronicle of those years and have become timeless examples of cinematic art. A candid portrait of a distinguished and outspoken man, this film includes conversations with colleagues Ralph Steiner, Joris Ivens and Donald Richie; footage of Edward Weston, his close friend and mentor; and many excerpts. It explores the dilemma of anyone with a social conscience who must face the harsh realities of earning a living while retaining their integrity. And it reveals a man in his seventies still determined to do good creative work.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/auUCUk2hwXdDB7agDHLZf6FVJ4X.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Conversations with Willard Van Dyke","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
