Designs were drawn, parts ordered but no car was ever released. On what would have been a celebratory 30th anniversary – no ‘Vette hit the market. In this HISTORY special, die-hard Corvette expert and builder Chris Mazzilli will try to fix this missing piece of muscle car history as he and his team build a one-of-a-kind 1983 Corvette from the ground up. The creation will be presented to a panel of experts, including the Corvette designers who pulled the plug on releasing the ’83 originally, to see if it’s worthy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sVmnFgRNNgxvwsld9Xs3jTtmz9b.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lost Corvette","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
