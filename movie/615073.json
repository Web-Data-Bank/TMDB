In the late 1950's the Vajont Dam - at the time the tallest in the world - was built into this steep valley. Just a few years later in 1963, a massive landslide spilled into the dam's artificial lake, causing the dam's reservoir to overflow. The massive wave that followed left nearly 2,000 people dead. The inhabitants of Erto have re-enacted the Passion of the Christ year after year since time immemorial, continuing their tradition even after the tragedy. Once a year on the night of Good Friday, a Christ from Erto is betrayed, condemned and crucified as History marches forward with its constructions and destructions, its victims and survivors, and its Calvaries - both real and imagined.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qRh8A0gqrGdJsGuSUydcZeXothf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La passione di Erto","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":1}
