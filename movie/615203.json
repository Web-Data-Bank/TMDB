Written in the style of poems dedicated to my daughter, they line the whole itinerary, at times stuck to windows , whether of trains, stations or museums, at times held by people met in the street.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Back to London","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
