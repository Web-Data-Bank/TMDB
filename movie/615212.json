On earth, Christmas, 1999, Jacques, who's dying of cancer, meets Sophie, pregnant and abandoned. Her babies and his death are due in the spring. Jacques runs a cabaret facing bankruptcy because his landlord insists on a 15-minute speech about Jesus every evening by the boring Bernard, and all the customers leave. Jacques prays for Bernard's removal: Heaven arranges a car crash. Jacques keeps a tape recorder handy, narrating his final days, focused on composing memorable last words. In Heaven, the dead Bernard keeps watch over Jacques and Sophie, with saving effect.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/k1AUCg2lOW4FqPyBAl5DpDEbpjg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98099,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aska Film Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2000-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heaven","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
