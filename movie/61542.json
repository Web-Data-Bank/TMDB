We follow their lives and tribulations as everyone converges on a regular basis at Montreal's hot disco spot: Starlight. Along the way, several events take place that change these characters' lives. As these characters' lives unfold, the Parti Québécois takes power changing the cultural landscape in Quebec while the disco craze slowly fades. While we keep up with these various characters - it is Bastien who is a central part of this story. His drug addiction, dreams to become an actor and womanizing - make him the \"bigger than life\" typical 70s character around which the whole story revolves.","popularity":3.089,"poster_path":"/VioU7s0DzEmLoMciaRepNbbuZn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6623,"logo_path":"/qvtEf5tM9IAEJUUhX9EcBl12Fhr.png","name":"Caramel Films","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":139299,"logo_path":null,"name":"Corsimar Films Inc","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2011-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":132,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Anything goes.
