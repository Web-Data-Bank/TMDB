Shot in saturated 16mm colour, this dreamlike film follows a primeval female figure exploring an ancient landscape poised over an endlessly blue sea. She is at once alienated from and engaged by her surroundings, which suggest a site of self-discovery as much as one of profound disorientation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kinetics","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
