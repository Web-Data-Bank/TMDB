Tara and her friends are beginning to feel the nostalgia associated with saying their final goodbyes to teachers and friends, excitedly capturing their comments by creating a reality based video yearbook. Their exuberance remains high with just two more days to go when something terrible has happened. A car accident has left two friends dead and another charged with negligent homicide for driving under the influence.
