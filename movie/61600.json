Hailed by Scott Foundas of Variety as \"a philosophical feast—at which it is possible to gorge oneself yet leave feeling elated,” the film is based on the work of one of the most influential and controversial philosophers of the 20th century, Martin Heidegger, who in 1933 swore allegiance to the National Socialists. By joining a vast philosophical narrative with an epic voyage along Europe’s greatest waterway, The Ister invites you to unravel the extraordinary past and future of ‘the West.’","popularity":0.822,"poster_path":"/lC06AZ0rErDcINZ8WXyKodscGs4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6990,"logo_path":null,"name":"Black Box Sound and Image","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2004-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":189,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A 3000km journey up the Danube river to the heart of Europe.","title":"The Ister","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":5}
