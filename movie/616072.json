The journey between Stockholm and Mariefred takes 3,5 hours. The steamboat Mariefred was manufactured over a hundred years ago and is one of the last steam-powered vessels on the lake. The steam whistle sounds when Maja, as she is called in Mariefred, steers into the bay towards Mariefred. A fanfare for the summer! A journey through a breathtakingly beautiful landscape to the sound of the old steam engine's quiet but powerful inhalation and exhalation. A declaration of love for old shipping and a rich history of the steam engine.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wTMbnbmHPw6Ml6SqsmJpOdVtbr7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2018-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ånga om sommaren","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
