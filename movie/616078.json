Brutal and unwilling medical acts, performed without anesthesia. The impression of being no more than \" a piece of meat \", and the pain, unbearable. \" It was no longer a delivery, it was a scene of massacre, \" describes a young mother, her voice white. Her testimony, bordering on sustainable, and those of several other women are at the heart of \"Tu enfanteras dans la Pain\".
