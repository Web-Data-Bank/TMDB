Witness how incredible animals – like leopards, elephants, lions, hippos and more – adapt to this unpredictable and changing landscape. When the lands are flooded, the Okavango Delta is both a sanctuary and a trap, giving and taking life in equal measure. Then, like a living, breathing ecosystem, the waters soon recede and life becomes about one thing – survival. The fate of the tens of thousands of animals that live in this place of spectacular natural drama is at stake.","popularity":1.195,"poster_path":"/h6w1y29s3BEuVKmaedPKxeHpxdm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":99272,"logo_path":"/xt9cawh63M0bkKrc0VvDtZ8q2sa.png","name":"Icon Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":7521,"logo_path":"/fRqMjLjyAqThtEg9P9WKCXLmCpJ.png","name":"National Geographic","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Flood","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":5}
