Today, it seems as though time has stopped. Anything can happen. Any incident could become an artistic or near-artistic statement. A rave, an event, an exhibition, even a party, for example for a birthday, can have the spirit of an artistic event if properly decorated and advertised in social networks. Even the absence of events, just hanging out in the creative space, can also be classed as some kind of «creative procrastination» or critical of the world of doing nothing. Modern art — performance, installation, video, becomes part of fashionable leisure time, part of a lifestyle. A kind of «psychedelic» pastime, in which the boundaries between everyday reality and artistic gesture are blurred, becomes commonplace.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2019-07-28","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mice","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
