People who are no longer young warm up under the guidance of a strong, young fitness instructor against the background of the recently restored rotunda in Moscow’s Neskuchny Gardens. The instructor encourages them: «Breathe! You can do it!». They do their best to carry out all the exercises correctly, ready for the main event — a march, to the chant of «left, right, left, right!».","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2011-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Workout","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
