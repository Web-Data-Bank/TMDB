Fifty-one years later, The Party in Taylor Mead’s Kitchen finds Taylor still living the life of the bohemian, devoted to poetry, painting, partying, acting, homo-eroticism, gossip, and indifference to bourgeois notions of hygiene. The Party in Taylor Mead’s Kitchen offers, in stark and humorous relief, the contrasting romantic beauty and squalid dereliction of la vie boheme.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8WHK9g8weHIQ0ghqbQbegecIkRo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Party in Taylor Mead's Kitchen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
