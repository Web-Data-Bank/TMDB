The noise of the machines, the steps, the daily hustle of the more than a thousand workers, entering and leaving the shifts. There were 12-hour days, people without holidays, a stolen youth so that the cloth would continue to leave the factory. The revolution came and everything changed. Strikes, picket strikes, worker’s rights. Then the globalisation came. The factory went down to close. We went back to it, with the former workers, the old and the young. The machines continue to work in the empty spaces, the ghosts wander illuminated by traces of light until the walls begin to fall.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mVhsNey455FQKfslPDmvxOm60Sw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34631,"logo_path":null,"name":"Red Desert Films","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2019-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Factory","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
