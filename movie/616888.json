It is the US midterm elections, and spoof news reporter Jonathan Pie is sent across the pond on the campaign trail. Jonathan meets real people who don't normally have a voice as he sorts through the utter carnage of US politics and delivers an extremely entertaining, witty take on Trump's America. He talks to all sides: Republicans, Democrats and independents, while attempting to work out whether Trump is going to destroy the planet with his stance on climate change, his relationships with volatile countries or his twitter account.  Pie comes away with a lot of his preconceptions blown out of the water but also with a few intact.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/reqnxnraZm74skVSz97q5zswWVT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":80893,"logo_path":"/hFzOkuR4FoZE1U1hvuojMp4Qfxa.png","name":"BBC Studios","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"It is the US midterm elections, and Jonathan Pie is sent across the pond on the campaign trail to meet real people who don't normally have a voice.","title":"Jonathan Pie's American Pie","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
