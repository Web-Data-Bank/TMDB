The arrival of economic migrants from China has irrevocably upset the balance of power, as old laws and ancient gods are doddering away. Subtle moments and small gestures reveal the trauma of expatriation, the burden of personal sacrifice, solitude and alienation, as well as the painful experience of otherness. As old structures begin to disintegrate and violence is about to erupt, one rule asserts itself above all others: eat or be eaten.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/v2zUymI5GcPkypORFHbgEAZDfay.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78334,"logo_path":null,"name":"Day Zero Film and Video","origin_country":""},{"id":74861,"logo_path":"/jBaVCWMfqTdg3C8at4nDxIzRzpT.png","name":"KinoElektron","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":108847,"logo_path":"/wXcInrUH3f5Vc2Ok13kURwUQ9Zv.png","name":"Keplerfilm","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2020-02-21","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Sotho","iso_639_1":"st","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Days of Cannibalism","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
