The narrator, Gaspard, a 17-year-old teenager, keeps a daily account in his diary of the homophobic harassment of which he is the victim. His tormentor is a student from his high school, Georgia. She is an emancipated girl who lives in a community with her brother Francis and his biker friends. In high school, Georgia does nothing. She is judged by the school administration as a delinquent seed, a sort of neo-Nazi amazon, an irredeemable sheep who spends her recesses smoking Craven A., drinking from her silver flask with suspicious contents and reading exclusively the novels of her favorite writer: Louis-Ferdinand Céline.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rOz3s0siThpSf01MslDTi1mElUd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Couteau suisse","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
