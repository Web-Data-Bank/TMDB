The film follows Alexis Tremblay and his family through the busy autumn days as they bring in the harvest and help with bread baking and soap making. Winter sees the children revelling in outdoor sports while the women are busy with their weaving, and, with the coming of spring young and old alike repair to the fields once more to plough the earth in preparation for another season of varied crops. One of the first NFB films to be produced, directed, written and shot by women.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oXzaU7ePldI3LiK70SA0cdoU4lj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1943-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alexis Tremblay: Habitant","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
