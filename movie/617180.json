Those on the fringe of society had to hold secret their thoughts, desires and inner workings. The DC Eagle opened in 1971 as a haven to gay men in the Leather/Levi community, giving a home, a brotherhood, and an active community to live and exist. This bar is unlike any other as the owners firmly believe the Eagle is bigger than any one person; it is the collective of the brotherhood. The Eagle still operates today upholding the traditions and philosophies that have served the community for over 40 years.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ytkaYsyBKOC9yED6oxzp1No1V0Z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-06-27","revenue":0,"runtime":111,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bound by Leather","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
