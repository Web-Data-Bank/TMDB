The film's structure is drawn from road signs found as fragments of a trip, with the quotidian images - of landscapes, city life, children playing, a wedding - collected like a diary in a combination of richly saturated colour and high-contrast black-and-white footage. In contrast to the emotive quality of the imagery and music, the voice-over/text provides a dispassionate and chilling guide on what to expect and how to behave in times of war.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
