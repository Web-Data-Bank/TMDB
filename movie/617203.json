The story is built by a succession of fleeting images in a manner both instinctive and erudite. Following an association of images from different cultural and historical contexts, PSYCHOPOMPE treats the strange transformation of \"mythological waste\" and its survival - through B-movies and amateur images as well as in moments from daily life. The soundtrack, inspired by minimal, ambiant and Noise music, is played live by its composer, Joakim, and his band the Disco. It is a peculiar mix of electronic sounds and acoustic instruments, stretched-out layers of sounds and noise explosions, outlining a cinematographic narrative: a story of metamorphoses.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6wPokmWIRR4yTRfTMeiya03EvhS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2011-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Psychopompe","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":3}
