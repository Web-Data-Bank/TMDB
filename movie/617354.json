It is the story of modern India - of changing caste equations and a realisation of this reality among the land owning class, albeit a bit late. Though the film is set in a remote village near Mangalore, it could well have happened in any other village elsewhere in India. An ex-landlord family comes to terms with the fact that they are living in their last leg of feudal existence when it cannot perform a last rites in a grand manner in which it was once used to.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zRG5bAB23wt3tH8HPFA3nEW3FOC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cleansing Rites","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
