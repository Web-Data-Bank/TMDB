They entangle in a colliding maze of forsaken loves, failed expectations and imperfect anticipations. A disintegrating web arises in which love exists, but as dispassionate yearning. Here affection is an indifferent desire that burns the soul to death.","popularity":4.457,"poster_path":"/bAERtg7tDuWjppFKFLnpxpqf5Tp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121069,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ashish Avikunthak Production","origin_country":"IN"},{"id":51666,"logo_path":null,"name":"Weltfilm","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2018-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dispassionate Love","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
