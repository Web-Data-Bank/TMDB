The eponymous bird talk is the language used by those excluded from the aggressive majority: a history teacher tormented by children, a teacher of Polish studies fired from his job, a girl who cleans a banker’s villa, a florist with a club foot and a student with a fascination for cinema. Pushed to the margins by the extreme right, they defend themselves with irony, songs and quotes from the classics.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/p537XYJ241MJqMpnBhjuXxi9jv6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72700,"logo_path":null,"name":"Metro Films","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":68045,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Orka","origin_country":""},{"id":122740,"logo_path":"/c0XQNpfyvFfyK9WxdADpl3wPYk5.png","name":"MX35","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":11240,"logo_path":"/i59ItaKFdxJ7Yi6w2s7CML0LBvI.png","name":"PISF","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2019-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":138,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"This movie is not for you","title":"Bird Talk","video":false,"vote_average":4.3,"vote_count":9}
