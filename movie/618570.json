This series features captured German and Russian film footage, much of which has never been seen before. For decades the Cold War prevented us from looking closely at what really happened between the Russians and the Germans on the Eastern Front during World War II. More than a struggle between nations, it pitted maniacal tyrant against maniacal tyrant, evil ideology against evil ideology. The lives of tens of millions of human beings were consumed by its raging hatreds and appalling indignities. One in every ten Russians died. One in every four Poles died. Whole divisions of Italians, Romanians, Hungarians disappeared with barely a trace. An average of 17,800 people died on every single day and this, the war on the Russian German Front, lasted for 1,400 days.  This series features captured German and Russian film footage, much of which has never been seen before.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/o3omO3j8g9lsPW9iuyPc60UAye2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10864,"logo_path":"/uPoKSf3GtME7IZz4alnoWvc0nWx.png","name":"CTV","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":138,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Russian German War","video":true,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
