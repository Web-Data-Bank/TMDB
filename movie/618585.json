With no food, water, or shelter, all seems lost â€“ until an eerily silent German minesweeper drifts ominously towards them, giving them one last chance at survival. As our motley crew explores the ship, it becomes all too clear that some diabolical fate has befallen its German crew. The mystery only deepens when they encounter a young Romanian girl, apparently the sole survivor, who leads them to a locked room in the bowels of the vessel.","popularity":8.497,"poster_path":"/kavmE1zj7w3KaaG1NMXp1lZGLZV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121249,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rock Island Films","origin_country":""},{"id":121250,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wicked of Oz Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2019-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blood Vessel","video":false,"vote_average":5.375,"vote_count":56}
