Excited by his experience in the far reaches of the world, he does not fail to immortalise everything he sees with his camera, in order to remember the landscapes and penguins when he returns home. On their part, the penguins will rapidly forget about him, as they cannot photograph him. An ironic reflection on contemporary travel and what it involves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fIFUCA5ZoaGeql59JgTem5R4YZ3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2019-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Let's go to Antarctica!","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
