During this years' Easter, Nizar decides to compete with the village children in the 'breaking eggs' games. His goal is to collect as many eggs as possible in order to sacrifice them in the village church for the sake of his beloved Jesus. Nizar's egg is 'Mashmaa' (a fake egg that is hardened by wax).
