When China was under siege from Japan in the late 1930s, Alley instigated an industrial co-op movement he termed  â€˜gung ho' (work together). Its success led to the phrase entering the global idiom. For this documentary a Geoff Steven-led crew travelled 15,000km in China in 1979, filming Alley as he gave his account of an engrossing, complex life story. Co-writer Geoff Chapple later wrote a biography of Alley.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iOwtZIpkHLPcYsS7gRVLUHZ6acQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31104,"logo_path":null,"name":"Phase Three Film Productions Ltd.","origin_country":""},{"id":7700,"logo_path":null,"name":"New Zealand National Film Unit","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"1980-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gung Ho - Rewi Alley of China","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
