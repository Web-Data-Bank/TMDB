That game was DJMAX TECHNIKA, and in creating it they wrote the rules of modern gaming years ahead of the rest of the gaming industry, and created a place for a community of life long friends to grow in a dim, neon-lit little corner of arcades, drawing eyes and hands with thumping bass and touching sound.
