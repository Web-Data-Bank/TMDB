It was created in the 19th century, and was first heard in 1900 - at the World Exhibition in Paris, where it represented Russia and won the Grand Prix. A year later, the instrument was installed at the conservatory. Since then, he had to go through a lot of events that undermined his health: wars, revolutions, flooding ... Restoration, carried out in 2014-2016, revived the creation of the French master Aristide Kawaye-Call to life. The film, created on the basis of unique filming inside an organ, demonstrates the restoration process and offers to look at the instrument as a living organism - a breathing giant with a thousand voices.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2019-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Симфония органа","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
