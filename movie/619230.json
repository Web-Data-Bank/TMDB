The work is filmed as an uncut ten-minute observation of a seemingly endless kiss on the top deck of a London double-decker bus. Disengaged from their immediate environment, a young couple begins an intimate game of desire. Over the course of the film their exchange of embraces gathers intensity, growing increasingly passionate and demanding. The camera follows waves of desire, at times verging on pain and aggression then again full of joy and lightness.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8Gr7tZwXUSoLRnUMVXdVvWqeL28.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kiss","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
