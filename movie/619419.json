Sasha, beaten by life, when we meet her, lives in a cluttered and untidy village house somewhere in the Moscow Region with her husband, with whom they swear dirtyly in the presence of their young son Ilya. Sasha smokes, drinks and endlessly suffers from a lack of love and from the fact that no one can understand it. Three years later, the viewer again sees her life - in another place, with another man and with a new child, but in about the same circumstances.","popularity":0.602,"poster_path":"/hFvJ8Ixvktz6K3aN7lDdwfa8BHp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113708,"logo_path":"/cZQdS8LJGgGQuimc0eqM9OazDzO.png","name":"TV-3 Channel","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2019-07-30","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Three Years Later","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
