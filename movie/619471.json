Alexander's life is an endless struggle for survival. Instead of a shop, there are mountains, instead of a refrigerator, a stream, instead of the Internet, a walkie-talkie. For 20 years he has not been to the city. Someday he wants to go on a world tour, to see Tibet, Rome, Australia. But for now, deer, nature and a dream are all that he has.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ki14DQrrBCYyMNPOwrps0fe5d6h.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123800,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eon Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2019-08-06","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Northern Wind Can Be Warm","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
