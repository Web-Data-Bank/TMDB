The film features in-prison footage, including a segment depicting a confession by a follower of the notorious Charles Manson, Leslie Van Houten, who was convicted of two killing sprees and committed to life in prison.","popularity":0.705,"poster_path":"/vQ27L1xOKCnjXvxRqW3KC9TYr6W.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":87693,"logo_path":null,"name":"Joseph Feury Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1983-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When Women Kill","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
