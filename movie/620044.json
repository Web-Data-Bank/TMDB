A message pops up on the smart screen, thanking unit #30562 for signing in. \"Are you ready for your next shift?\" The mirror asks in a soft female voice. #30562 says yes and the screen loads her itinerary for the evening. It explains that her first guest will be a returning client.\r While the radio plays in the background, items get tossed in as Alex (Adriana Chechik), a 21-year-old college student, hurriedly packs for the weekend. It's her anniversary with Derek (Seth Gamble), her boyfriend of several years. \"Hey, pull over for a moment,\" she coos in his ear. Derek looks down at her hand before a smile crosses his face. Suddenly, he notices a red glowing light in the trees just past their car. \"Do you see that?\" He says, pointing. He looks in the direction of his finger at the ominous crimson glow.","popularity":0.858,"poster_path":"/l3nRmpMuvP6AQYpRgki1uLI7xO9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97187,"logo_path":"/8b3EX6zgcWIBhlAMJjlaX8j35hS.png","name":"Pure Taboo","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Future Darkly 3","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
