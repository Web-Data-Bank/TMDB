Stimulus for the creation of this work was provided by the Portuguese electronic label Cr√≥nica. They invited musicians and video artists from around the world to each create a two minute-long miniature for a CD and DVD compilation on the theme \"Essays on Radio: Can I have two minutes of your time?\" Radio should hereby offer an artistic reference point as a sound medium, as technology, and as a cultural form of expression. Similar to previous collaborations between @c and lia, also created for radio_int.14/37, the visual level for the already existing soundtrack arose by means of specially programmed re-activated software.(Gerald Weber)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"radio_int 14.37","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
