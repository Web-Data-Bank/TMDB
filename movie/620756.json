This is their last chance. And here in Iqaluit, far to the north, they have found solitude, potential redemption, and, most unexpectedly, a place that’s not easy to leave. Claude, Ramy, Patrick, Michel and Chaïd are now taxi drivers, endlessly cruising the ring road, the dozen-kilometre highway that holds all their hopes, dreams and fears. Beautifully photographed by Donat Chabot, this unique film by Sophie Fortier is deeply melancholic and affecting.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jHZRxb8xAUqCW1V09kouHib1DBA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107052,"logo_path":"/AoD2U5Mi0sCjZjN72kxS26uT2CH.png","name":"Spira","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":17704,"logo_path":"/wf9blZfYeKwIWs9Im4V9lfgjLNb.png","name":"Peripheria Productions","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Exil au Far West","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
