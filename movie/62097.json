She returns to Montreal where she is welcomed by her geeky but cute brother. She meets Lorenzo, a cranky, ex-racer who owns a bike shop. The two become friends. Laurie gets a job with a local bicycle courier company, but a member of the group is intent on shutting her out of their circles, making her life difficult and sad. After a bonding truth-revealing discussion between Laurie and Lorenzo, Laurie begins to see what she has to do to make things better for herself.","popularity":1.064,"poster_path":"/wvVZxSFZ4KmhKR6O8k5itVbbwK9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":103083,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cable Distribution Fund","origin_country":""},{"id":8117,"logo_path":"/eVsVPEZRK63zsQMxxSHf5Cv017g.png","name":"Max Films","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1998-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"2 Seconds","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":13}
