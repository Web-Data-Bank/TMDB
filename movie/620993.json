Calling her friend Marceline “the second part of this legend [of Joris Ivens]”, she pays tribute to her as one who, after losing her “beloved and symbiotic partner, has kept her dynamism and liveliness as a person and a filmmaker”. The cinematic portrait illustrates how Loridan was in fact much more than a shadow at Ivens’s side.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-12-30","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bride of the Wind","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
