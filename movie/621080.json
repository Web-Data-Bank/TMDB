No one knows she also likes girls offset. But the assistant director's a jerk, Ronnie's girlfriend's fed up, and bits of a disturbing 1970s gay \"utopia\" parallel world are seeping into Ronnie's real life. Investigating, Ronnie encounters a disease from Hollywood's yesteryear that may explain why actors keep mum about their same-sex love affairs; an illness spread by frothy blue liqueurs and perfume atomizers: the Viva Voce Virus. Holding the key to the mystery is ex-starlet Gloria, inventor of a very special cocktail.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3YLsd0wgc0E1Yg7b2It66ighijJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Viva Voce Virus","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":1}
