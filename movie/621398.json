A fascinating and faintly ridiculous film following the adventures the Diamond Hoo Ha Men (aka Gaz & Danny from Supergrass) on their UK live club tour throughout December 2007. An unsettling behind-the-scenes peek into life on the road with the world's finest sequin-suited glange rock duo.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Chas Harrison Rockumentary","title":"Glange Fever","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
