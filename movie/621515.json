With his blond hair, toned body, and charming smile, it's no surprise that he's become quite popular. He's only been on his mission a short while, but he's already earned a reputation for being a bit of a mischief-maker. He's gotten into trouble for pantsing the other boys, short-sheeting beds, and turning off alarm clocks so the other missionaries through their wake-up times. Needless to say, the higher priesthood is keeping an eye on him. The men of the Order love a rebel. There's no greater joy than seeing a willful young man brought to his knees, ready and eager to serve. Elder Holland thinks he's a big man, but he'll soon discover that he'll do anything to hear the words \"good boy.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/j2vdbUX15cC0A86hcTqpmXjJ07g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98342,"logo_path":null,"name":"Missionary Boyz","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":155,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elder Holland: Chapters 1-6","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
