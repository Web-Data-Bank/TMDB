These three plays unfold in real time and track the lives of the Gabriels throughout the coming presidential election year. To the rhythm of peeling, chopping and mixing, Hungry places us in the center of the Gabrielâ€™s kitchen. The family discusses their lives and disappointments, and the world at large and nearby.
