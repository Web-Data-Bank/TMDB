A working couple hire one to prepare meals and take their child to school. Another house helper looks after an old man who lives alone. For these and many other reasons, Filipino house helpers are in demand in Hong Kong.  On Sundays, the house helpers congregate in a square in Hong Kong Island's Central District. Here, they reminisce about their families back home. A beauty contest is held each June to celebrate Philippine Independence Day. The ladies dress up in their finest as they try to take the crown and live their most precious dream - to be free.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"},{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sunday Cinderella","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
