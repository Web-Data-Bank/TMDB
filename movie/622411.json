However, his films remained strongly connected with his comic strips both in terms of style and narrative, and some of these are actually the animated version of his comics. Elegy, Dragić's debut film, for example, is based on his comic called Nostalgia, as he explains in an interview with Bosnian-Swedish theorist and animator Midhat Ajanović in his book \"Nedeljko Dragić: The Man and the Line\" (2014). Elegy is about a prisoner longing for the flower that caught his eye through the bars of his cell. The animation is quite static, a quality coming from his background in comics.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tgMOHNacRECZWOB6KfXmUHsHbvE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5724,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zagreb Film","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"YU","name":"Yugoslavia"}],"release_date":"1965-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Elegy is about a prisoner longing for the flower that caught his eye through the bars of his cell","title":"Elegy","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4}
