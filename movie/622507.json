The limited job opportunities available in their rural area have left the family mired in poverty. Zoryana becomes a hostage between her two closest people, her mother and Edgars – she must choose between her mother’s advocacy of countryside as the best place for raising a family and life in the city, which would offer more creature comforts and more opportunities to earn a living. Zoryana Horobraya sweeps us along on Zoryana’s journey, as she tries to escape the protective bubble of her mother and define her own family’s happiness and existence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kmBiMTiTkx7cuIhV3fn9XgpoN8r.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127616,"logo_path":null,"name":"Latvijas Kultūras akadēmija","origin_country":"LV"},{"id":146706,"logo_path":null,"name":"Air Productions (LV)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2019-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latvian","iso_639_1":"lv","name":"Latviešu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zoryana Horobraya","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
