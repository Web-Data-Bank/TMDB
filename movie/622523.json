Some are in distress, others run out of hot water. The bath-showers are their ephemeral refuge, before returning to the city, to the street. Here we recover strength and cause. Yet violence is never far away. A bad look, an insult, a sudden gesture. The staff of the bath-showers, prevents slippage. Out of the world, it's a whole world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ifTfrKbicbFPvNhnRjYBJwkZDTA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2019-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Public showers, Oberkampf street, Paris","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
