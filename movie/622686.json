In this tradition, male artists often crossdress as women on stage and are referred to as ‘laundas’. The most legendary name in this tradition is Bhikhari Thakur’s— an actor, playwright, and a social reformer popularly known as the ‘Shakespeare of Bhojpuri.’ The film follows the last four Naach performers to have worked with him and creates a visual archive of their performance tradition. As they share their plays, songs and a lifetime of memories, they immerse us into the world of folk theatre where we begin to see a glimpse of budhau– the old man, himself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sebTYWqNsLKfQ2VusfUVMmt0fBR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Naach Bhikhari Naach","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
