A solitary worker, who’s most likely dedicated all of his life to this big dying monster, is finally forced to face reality. He’s got only one friend − his big black and white canine companion. Almost with no words and with a great irruption of archive material, Julietta Korbel portrays this man and the Chavalon power plant with the gentleness of who’s shooting a real-life documentary subject.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fDbaZP8A96OwHjRyOWwAn22DEyK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":23845,"logo_path":null,"name":"Thera Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2019-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Still Working","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
