For the majority of the season, José Mourinho and his players battled to achieve what no other team had managed in the history of English football - the quadruple! Eventually injuries, which had dogged the side throughout the campaign, and fatigue caught up with them and they had to settle for a cracking double with victory in the Carling Cup and FA Cup. The Blues defeated their arch-rivals Manchester United with a dramatic victory in the first FA Cup at the new Wembley Stadium to complete José Mourinho's collection of medals in English football. This programme is packed with the action, drama and goals from this incredible 2006/07 season. Relive all these wonderful moments time and time again.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/l9H59K7MptattvgpiYqb6tjiIDz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121666,"logo_path":null,"name":"ILC Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2007-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":250,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Cup Kings!","title":"Chelsea FC - Season Review 2006/07","video":true,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
