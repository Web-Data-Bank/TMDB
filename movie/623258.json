Swann re-filmed the sequences frame by frame on Super-8, creating a three screen semi-abstracted, colour-saturated triptych. The images depict men and women in ambiguous situations of embrace or violence, creating a frieze of charged scenes whose effect is heightened by overlaying the original soundtracks with the wailing of police sirens and other sound effects.\" - Sotiris Kyriacou","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/affy1V8jIb9dkrBTxO76OZ6Waxv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Passion Triptych","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
