When sleazy theatrical agent Maurice Beiner (Arthur Donaldson) is found stabbed to death in his office, just about everybody is a suspect -- there's aspiring actress Clancy Deane (Eileen Huban), who was one of the last people to see him alive, and Sophie Carey (Alma Rubens) who knows he has some love letters she wrote to Judge Walbrough (George MacQuarrie) before she married her alcoholic husband, Don (Henry Sedley). Or is it Marc Weber (Norman Kerry), who had a falling out with Beiner, or Weber's devoted wife, Fay (Ethel Duray)?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mHkg4PivCzbVZfoNBg6mTyOxRUv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1442,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cosmopolitan Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1922-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Find the Woman","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
