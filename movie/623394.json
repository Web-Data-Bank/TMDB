When a chance encounter with a stranger leads to their finding themselves transported to an old west town in the 1870s, they're forced into situations where failure appears to be a foregone conclusion. Terrified by change and even the hint of danger, Vaughn and Larry are a given a task that must be completed within two weeks or risk never returning to their modern day reality. Given their built-in limitations, a hilarious series of events ensue as they work to overcome their fears, competing interests and they must do battle with an ill-tempered gunslinger in an effort to return home.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7uqlTn8GHOnV0Dje2DSrcmpUAqV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121935,"logo_path":null,"name":"Four80 Vault Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Debacle","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
