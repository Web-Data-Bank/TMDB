Although he can’t speak, he tries to communicate using his letter chart. That’s how he tells Maider, the director of the film, that at the age of 21 he felt God talking to him for the first time. But today, now that he has moved out of his parent’s house into a home, he no longer feels God. Once a year, Jordi makes a pilgrimage to the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes, where he searches for his connection with God, despite not knowing if God will come back one day.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/erQ42Dn6HdH7KTshkyMkkXDQqIk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113606,"logo_path":null,"name":"Señor \u0026 Señora","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2019-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jordi's Letters","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
