These rare films - discovered after a fire tragically destroyed the model masterpiece in 1972 - capture the devotion and sly humor that Allen infused into his miniature universe. Trains in two gauges cross snow-capped mountains and more than 100 soaring bridges. Despite outlaws, train wrecks, trolleys, bustling cities and thousands of miniature people inhabit this world. Get a peek into the mind of its creator to see his innovative techniques now in common use by model railroaders around the globe. From track-side close ups to sweeping vistas, the expert photography of Richard Reynolds and Glenn Beier will inspire train fans and model railroaders alike - indeed anyone with an imagination!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vN3bfFl97jxr7EeXhKBILW7z3Us.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121981,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sunday River Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"John Allen's Gorre & Daphetid","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
