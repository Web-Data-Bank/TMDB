Since the end of conflict in 2002, the people of Sierra Leone have strived to build a democratic and peaceful society. The path remains difficult, with poverty entrenched, yet signs of progress, too often ignored by the international media, can also be found. Sierra Leone has held two consecutive democratic elections, and women and young people have taken the lead in creating an engaged civil society. This short film documents the progress Sierra Leone has made since the end of its brutal civil war and the hope of a new generation for creating a more just society.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p8Yqxc7ooYglwl9LcbRvSR73Hh3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SL","name":"Sierra Leone"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sierra Leone Rising","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
