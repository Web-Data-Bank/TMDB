Joined by friends Anton and Julie, the trio cycle through the Swedish countryside, and as the sun begins to set, more friends enter the fray, bottles of beer are opened and guitars thrum as the group party into the night. But Johan is still deep in thought. When the sun eventually rises, Johan's fears have long since faded away.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/c5JKcfZw9UIfIwPf6RnhB1DDTkH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2008-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Brakes","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
