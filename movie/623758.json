They are very close. They live together, sharing the living space, the mobile phone, and a huge old Cadillac. We don’t know where their parents are. But they are present only in the boys’ conversations.  Through a series of dreams and hallucinations, we get a glimpse into Ryan’s mental state before his brother does. We are given the opportunity to see the world through the eyes of a young man struggling with his sexuality in the stuffy environment of the margins. He is down with the Cadillac blues.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mC1MSmbTfe5ZDhHhkIxXJCmxzpj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-08-22","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cadillac Blues","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
