A cast of memorable characters, including Linder herself, inhabit the film’s glaringly vivid surroundings, acting out as photographer Tim Walker describes “a display of human sexuality, lunacy and chaos.”\r The film traces a compressed history of glamour, from its origins in 18th-century Scotland describing enchantment, to its present day aerosolic ghosts.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forgetful Green","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
