He was adopted as a baby by Jasna and Senad, who were unable to have children of their own. However, four years after the adoption, Jasna gives birth to Dado. Throughout his life, Arman has had a hard time coping with being an adopted child. Full of explosive energy, he constantly gets in trouble together with his schoolmates. Despite being very intelligent, he is labelled as a problem child. The only place he feels safe and loved is with Jasna’s parents. At the same time, Arman does all he can to save Dado from self-destructing. However, despite everything he does to support his brother, his parents interpret Arman’s involvement incorrectly, and blame him for every trouble with Dado.","popularity":0.601,"poster_path":"/aTwoqkydgVoqgI5W7hekCLG9xDz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72115,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sarajevo Dokument","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BA","name":"Bosnia and Herzegovina"}],"release_date":"2019-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bosnian","iso_639_1":"bs","name":"Bosanski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Son","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":3}
