Into those holes that surround us with the sweetness of puffy dough we plunge into a landscape of desolation and rebirth, never again to deny the terror that piles up in the sky like a malignant mound of virgin pudding. A mass of revolving turbulence hell-bent on defying gravity in the name of vertical instability and electrical insanity. A supercell for the supersized who flee its windy wrath.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wxqcTUGTUzswv9H3hQWnAxuqwe7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Supercell","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
