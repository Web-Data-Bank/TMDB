His career dreams are nearly dashed when he notices a mysterious girl named Fern living on his block in an 88' Toyota Tercel hatchback. Fern's father went missing and assumed dead when she was a young child living in Montana. After receiving a cryptic letter from a stranger named Dr. Green, telling her that her father is alive and living in LA, she decides to go look for him herself.
