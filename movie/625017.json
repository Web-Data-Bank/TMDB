Moving images eclipsed, in slivers and swathes, by immovable shadows of deadwood. Waking, sleep and everything in between proved indistinguishable. This documentary recreates elements of existential banality (on view) and guides focus inward. It establishes a firm, if converse, analog between cinema and consciousness: an interplay of movie (and its constituent elements of light, shadow and audience) mirrored in consciousness (and its building blocks of waking, sleep and dream) if you will.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/14d5D5vtQXQLtqk3gFTXvYvPxQp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":141902,"logo_path":null,"name":"Three Corner Fish Films","origin_country":""},{"id":141903,"logo_path":null,"name":"Museum of National Taipei University of Education","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stray Dogs at the Museum","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
