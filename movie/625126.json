Many of these people possess a unique knowledge about nature, tilling of the land and the symbiosis between all living organisms surrounding them. At the same time Chile is a country with rising financial, ecological and climate related issues, and capitalism cannot find a solution. Rather it’s making it worse.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":122207,"logo_path":null,"name":"TRIABA producciones","origin_country":""},{"id":122208,"logo_path":null,"name":"World Cultures United","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2019-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When we come all together, with faith and commitment, we can start a new community”","title":"We are Seeds, We are Community","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
