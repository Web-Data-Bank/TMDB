The film presents the character of a statesman who emerges from his long silence to present his views on the different events and issues in Morocco today, in comparison to the image of the statesman between the years of the seventies and eighties and the prestige in which he lived, and the statesman today who no longer enjoys a seed of dignity. Strength is measured by the amount of screaming, far from common sense.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hHyFjMsGCggFmUjVGHqhWaaC4bM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MA","name":"Morocco"}],"release_date":"2016-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Amharic","iso_639_1":"am","name":""},{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"Avaric","iso_639_1":"av","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"جوع كلبك","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
