Scratched and printed directly onto black film, the film frames were synchronized frame by frame with Dave Brubeck's Take 5. The working print of the film featured the shortest possible cuts, only four to five frames long. Where necessary, three of the four frames were then painted over in black again in order to be able to assemble the frame precisely.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kk0TWT4Il7WED5Zm5z9388LADGQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"1966-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inclinations","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
