This tape was shot over a two week period but means to document a “day” in the life of the Midwest—it begins at swim team practice at 8:00am and ends after midnight in the parking lot of an all-night grocery store. It is a series of idiosyncratic sequences which suggest a certain sense of extreme in the gestures of the everyday. A man waits for his flight in the airport. A teenage girl walks through her sub-division to meet a friend. An older woman washes her hair in the sink. A young boy sits on the floor playing video games. A plane flies overhead. Clouds shift. Cars move across the overpass. A grocery store is open all night.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A1ZRLE9B2tPlvhF4dHlBP6RxGET.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Room With the Walls Blasted to Shreds and Falling","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
