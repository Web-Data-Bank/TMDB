What is your will for my life? I want to be in alignment with your will, so please show me what I should do for a living.\" This has been the earnest prayer of countless Christians. Does God answer this prayer, or does He reveal what you are supposed to do in other ways? Todd Friel, host of Wretched Radio, will provide you the tools to make small and big decisions so you will KNOW that you are in God's will.  No more regrets over bad decisions. No more wondering if you are reading signs from God right. Just simple, Biblical principles that will help you make a decision and sleep like a baby at night regardless of how well it turns out.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/394DwKBQspEdZGUnKcjsclCI5GD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91794,"logo_path":null,"name":"Burning Bush Communications","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Decisions, Decisions","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
