But as they approach thirty, their paths begin to diverge. Hana gets married, Bazo goes to work in Canada, and Maja moves in with her boyfriend. In David's life, however, nothing changes, and he himself isn't sure whether or not that's a good thing. He would certainly be better equipped to face his problems among friends rather than in lonely isolation. Using the naturally charismatic David as example, this energetic, subtly ironic film comments on the void that often grows between the world of carefree partying and the settled life of adulthood, a reality that takes some people by surprise.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3fCfaa9XjFZJEJXFVWeKecTU7ZY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115763,"logo_path":"/g9jxB6NTRBi80IM1yb2lwNSMmeN.png","name":"Artichoke","origin_country":"SK"},{"id":90845,"logo_path":null,"name":"FTF VŠMU","origin_country":"SK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SK","name":"Slovakia"}],"release_date":"2019-07-02","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kid","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
