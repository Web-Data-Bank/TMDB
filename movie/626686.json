These include the departure from Swansea, the 1 in 52 climb up to Cockett tunnel and the reversal at Llanelli. Nowadays the route is signalled entirely from Pantyffynnon Box, and here we see the line's last remaining semaphores. Our single car class 153 unit then tackles the famous bank up to Sugar Loaf tunnel.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8p4AN6BchJM1IkNWVQUE1ycMhgA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heart of Wales","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
