The hooded figure in the box. A big plate of pasta, and that chair on wheels. Messages of moral guidance clash with actions that are on a collision course with dilapidation. And through it all the water runs, the fridge is full and hearts yearn for that which mellows the melody of Godâ€™s glockenspiel. For the winds of change rattle the bones of the grim reaper as he swings his scythe in rhythm to a cacophony of corruption intrinsic to this orchestra pit of purgatorial preludes and egg laying swan songs.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/e3tuJG7tD3GZv2780IwLDL2Ty3O.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Temple of Torment","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
