Intense audio-video synesthesia is produced by sonifying and visualizing raw electronic signals as directly as possible, creating an intricately intertwined relationship between what is heard and what is seen as sound and image take turns leading and following each other in a perpetual dance. Each work follows an improvised trajectory, navigating the sonic and visual landscape produced by folding electronic signals inwards upon themselves. Apeiron | Peras audio-video works are the result of a process of seeking balance between exerting expressive control over an otherwise raw electronic signal and letting the wild, unpredictable current follow its own path.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Apeiron | Peras IX","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
