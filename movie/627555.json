Three realities spiral together as a woman sacrifices everything attempting to escape the labyrinth, fighting to become the master of her consciousness.  A twisting triptych of narratives spirals together a contemporary metaphor, exploring the dark night of the soul. The themes of imprisonment by technology, torture, sacrifice we make for our material reality. Self empowerment, rebirth, naked and bloody as a warrior within fights to escape.  The ‘Triskelion’ is a maze-like symbol of three interlocking spirals, the film structure moves in a similar way, connected at the centre through the characters journey, whilst evolving as three narrative layers pull the story into a spiral. Each of the themes drift towards their own end whilst forming a complete visual puzzle at the climax.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7fwLrUEkNUUrnggQbW5mOv1i0Nd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Triskelion","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
