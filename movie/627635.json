The real source of the ominous winds lies with Jina, who finds the strange word 'LingLing' written in her father’s notebook. She suspects he is cheating on her mother, who appears to be bored with life and fills the house with potted plants as if to show for her apathy. The film too is riddled with images of humid air and foul-smelling water, impure and overflowing. The sway of her father’s fishing pole and the flutters in Jina’s skirt seem perilous and unstable. When her anxiety and doubts finally come to a head, the family squarely face the rough downpour brought on by the storm. The director’s talent in boldly translating the characters desires and sensibilities into a narrative with powerful imagery is quite impressive.","popularity":0.602,"poster_path":"/c2rHza9DomhnYyHBv2KuvUlHu9Y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2019-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"LingLing","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
