Is there a way to show the tragedy of families that lost their loved ones, thousands of people forced to leave their homes, soldiers doing the fighting, and children who cannot comprehend the situation? Salomé Jashi answers this question in a way that leaves few apathetic, though the horrors of war are never visible on the screen. Her short film is based on an interesting formula of making the audience witness to a tragedy it never sees.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/z8N8V5Vd43gJvpM99X4tNOVvEh1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GE","name":"Georgia"}],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Speechless","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
