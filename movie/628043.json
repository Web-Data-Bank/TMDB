On her journey, she is waylaid by bandits, and becomes entangled in the political problems of a neighboring country, whose ruler Prince Dantan, has been ousted by his evil half-brother Gabriel. Dantan, disguised as a simple goat hunter, has been driven into hiding in the mountains with his followers. Beverly is rescued by his band of rebels, but is mistaken for Princess Yestive. Beverly and Dantan fall in love, but their romance is complicated, not only by the hostilities between the two countries, but also because neither of them knows the true identity of the other.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eYrpudAXXVuAMHXlSJVoB0O4UeA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1914-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beverly of Graustark","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
