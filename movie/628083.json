Some of the volunteers were congenitally disabled; others became blind in their lifetime. In the film they draw self-portraits and landscapes, occasionally asking the artist for instructions or giving verbal explanation for their decisions. Their paintings are clumsy and abstract. It is however not the resulting works but the process of making them that is at the core of the film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/esdaXK7AOddlpqGHR8dRb1vX2hI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2018-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blindly","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
