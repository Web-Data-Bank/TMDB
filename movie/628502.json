This reflection was the catalyst for the photographic and narrative strategies of \"On Land Over Water.\"  \"On Land Over Water...\" was born out of an image-notion of a skid mark on a highway, photographed in close-up, revealing texture and form. The image would be positioned with a voice-over narration, telling the story of a young boy witnessing a fatal auto accident and its ensuing aftermath. Over the following winter months I meditated on the cinematic potentials of that notion, \"On Land Over Water...\" is the product of working out variations of that meditation. In story discourse, \"On Land...\"experiments with the possibilities of adopting the characteristics of the short story to the forms of cinema.
