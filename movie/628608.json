Four artists are finishing a workshop in a palace in Northern Spain as they recall a strange incident that happened to two long-time married couples who got lost nearby years before. After a dream-like walk in the mountains, the couples, strangers to each other, arrived in a mythic burial place called Sad Hill, where they had to face the naked facts of their hollow marriages in a totally new psychological light. The wives started the same walking ballet as did Clint Eastwood, Lee van Cleef and Eli Wallach in Leone’s film. In a few minutes, the lives of the couples would change completely.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dLfygKNkAmsL26Yxu8tqtTAehBc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94649,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bad Taste Ltd.","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2019-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Basque","iso_639_1":"eu","name":"euskera"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When women claim their freedom","title":"Once Upon a Time in Sad Hill","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
