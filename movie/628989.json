However, without a coach on his side and no real training routine, the determined boy has no other choice but to turn the whole village into his running track. Now, even the smallest of errands are a reason for a battle against the clock--but, when everything goes wrong all at once on the big day of the 200m final--a frenzied race against Andipas' friends, the villagers, and ultimately, the clock, will be on.
