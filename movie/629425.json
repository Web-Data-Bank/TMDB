Billionaire venture capitalists virtually control the city's government. Skyrocketing rents and evictions have driven out ethic and middle class communities. But a grassroots backlash threatens the power of tech. The feature-length documentary, 'Company Town,' is the story of an intense election campaign that will determine the fate of the city at the epicenter of the digital revolution. The whole world is watching as similar revolts against Uber, Airbnb, and other multi-billion dollar companies erupt around the world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pF5bXHjgBR44t1Agy6MgS9y2Q8l.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39388,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bullfrog Films","origin_country":""},{"id":122773,"logo_path":null,"name":"Snitow-Kaufman Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Is this the future of cities?","title":"Company Town","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
