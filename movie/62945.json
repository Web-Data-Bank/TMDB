The tour that was supposed to happen when Jim came back from Paris. The tour that we were all eagerly anticipating. In May or June of 1971, Jim called John from Europe and asked him how LA Woman was doing. John told him it was doing great and that the critics actually loved it, too. Jim was excited and wanted to go on the road as soon as he got back to the States. The two of them even talked about taking the bass player - Jerry Sheff - on the road with the four original Doors to duplicate the sound of the LP.","popularity":0.621,"poster_path":"/5NGaRBycVthkcMjZAIZv3NXo0jU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Doors of the 21st Century - L.A.
