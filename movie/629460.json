A story about the life in the world of gangs whose soldiers know only one language – violence. Rape, extortion, brutal beatings… Two families found themselves in the hell from which it is not easy or maybe impossible to escape. Marabunta are extremely dangerous legionary ants that always attack in a group and destroy everything that stands in their way.
