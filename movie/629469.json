As many as 420 thousand Karelians had to leave their homes and move into the land within the Finnish borders. Not until the collapse of the communist behemoth could they make a symbolic return to their homeland. The documentary captures the encounter of the present with the past. The point of reference for archival photos and recordings is a trip made by contemporary Karelians to the land of their ancestors.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inheritance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
