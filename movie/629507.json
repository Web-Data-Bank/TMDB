From the very first game there was high drama with the hosts suffering a surprise defeat to Greece. In Group B England looked to have defeated the French until the final minutes when the magic feet of Zidane scored not once but twice. Group C went down to the wire, Sweden and Denmark needed to draw 2-2 for both teams to make the Quarter Finals and put Italy out of the competition.  It couldn't possibly happen... but it did.  Group D was expected to be hotly contested and it produced arguably the best game of the tournament when the Czech Republic came back from two goals down to defeat the Dutch 3-2.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3vP9eoQQFljWamL0elBAIM8k32B.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-08-20","revenue":0,"runtime":184,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Official Review of UEFA Euro 2004","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
