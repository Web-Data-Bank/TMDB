But does real life compare? We follow some of the most daring archaeologists and take on the dangers they face--Egyptian archaeologist Zahi Hawass steps into a booby-trapped tomb; American Arthur Demarest fights looters in the jungles of Cancuen; and in Chiapas, angry villagers kidnap Australian-born Peter Mathews. We also examine stories of past explorers who helped shape the \"Indiana Jones\" stereotype--paleontologist Roy Chapman Andrews battled venomous snakes and Mongol bandits in the Gobi Desert; John Pendlebury, the British archaeologist, fought Nazis on Crete; and Sylvanus Morely, who was the first American archaeologist/spy. There are no special effects, no stuntmen, and no retakes...and for these real-life archaeologists, no guarantee they'll survive for a sequel.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9a417vvN741BlIooTGQAShXzT7h.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-21","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Real Tomb Hunters: Snakes, Curses and Booby Traps","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
