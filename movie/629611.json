He calls at her address and sees two suitors try and fail. He then goes to a menagerie, where he buys two lions. With these he returns and enters the office where the contract is to be signed if he should prove the victor. All flee before Gavroche and his lions, all but the heiress, who flies into his arms begging protection. Thus it is that he caused her the greatest emotion or thrill and she gladly names him victor and husband-to-be.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":24092,"logo_path":null,"name":"Société Française des Films Éclair","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1912-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gavroche veut faire un riche mariage","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
