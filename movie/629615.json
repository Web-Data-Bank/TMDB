His heart is warmed when he falls in love with his fragile neighbour, but then her illness takes a turn for the worse.  The National Centre for the Performing Arts in Mumbai presents this innovative semi-staged production of Puccini’s beloved opera. Carlo Rizzi conducts the lush score, which is interspersed with texts from Henri Murger’s original novel to tell the tale of the lives and loves of the young bohemian artists in the Latin quarter of Paris.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/o1o5ZiH2XIayiVCnBDOXdY5qxLB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La bohème - NCPA","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
