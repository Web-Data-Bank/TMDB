During the creation process, they learned about the current aging situation in China. There are too many elderly people who lack company. So they decided Use what I have learned to shoot this movie \"Everything is Like You\". From the perspective of young people, it tells ten stories about \"old care, filial piety and respect for the elderly\". Their actions have been strongly supported by the older generation of film artists.
