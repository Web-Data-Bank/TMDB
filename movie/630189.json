Critical of all manifestations of fascism, the film's visuals and sound set up a tension between two libidinal economies - that of fascism (the super father) where the father is everything, and the world of the masochist, where the mother is everything and the father is nothing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Father is Nothing","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
