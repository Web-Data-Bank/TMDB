This film tells the story of Philip Johnson's New York State Pavilion during the glory days of the fair, and chronicles its demise over the past 50 years. The film details its post-fair use as a 60's concert venue and 70's roller rink, including the years of neglect and recent growing advocacy efforts.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-05-22","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Modern Ruin: A World's Fair Pavilion","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
