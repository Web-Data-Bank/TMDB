Eyes closed, his face filling the screen in extreme close-up, the camera looking up from his chin, he inhabits a dreamlike, intensely theatrical space. Alternately humming and whispering, Acconci begins an oddly poetic, hypnotic monologue, a stream-of-consciousness fantasy of a gunfighter in the American West. \"As if I were riding in from over the mountains... Where did I come from?\" His fingers run over the landscape of his face in the rhythm of a galloping horse, or caress it as the narrative tension builds. With language as a catalyst, he conducts a riveting examination of his own identity through American cultural mythologies.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rEXvUTtG0WaaBs4PJ4XXekW3Zgd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Face of the Earth","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
