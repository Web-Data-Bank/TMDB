It’s the first example of Dammbeck’s experimental, grotesque, surrealistic style of animation. The idea of flying, which Dammbeck uses here for the first time, will reappear continuously in his next films. THE TAILOR OF ULM established Dammbeck’s reputation among East German animation directors.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vkWWg1mz2vLGDlqZUJqEv0Yp2Dv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Tailor of Ulm","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
