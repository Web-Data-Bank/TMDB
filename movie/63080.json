Outside of Germany, labor is cheaper and regulations are less constricting. But over and beyond this fascinating capital venture there remains the harsh reality of the everyday life of the hard-working Polish laundrywomen, through whose hands the white sheets pass. While Beata struggles to raise her three children on her meager salary, Monika reminisces about her unrealized childhood dreams of becoming a doctor, and is compelled to watch her teenage daughter Marta gradually follow in her footsteps.","popularity":0.637,"poster_path":"/nHswo9BuUYZ3hWukGJy4MI2ciBq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135050,"logo_path":null,"name":"Piffl Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2009-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die wundersame Welt der Waschkraft","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":1}
