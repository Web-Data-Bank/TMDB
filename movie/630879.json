I hoped that the title might bring to mind the American Elm tree, which was seen to be doomed by way of disease.  The assassination of Kennedy in 1963 was a tremendously emotional blow and omen of things to come. The whole country watched the funeral ceremonies play out on TV, and I taped everything I could of those events – music,  words, prayers, the killing of Lee Harvey Oswald , and more. I needed to make a film that would incorporate some of those sounds, but I also wanted to introduce other components. Some people assumed I was making an homage to JFK. That is not the case. I think it should be clear that what I was concerned about was the evolving state of our nation.\" –Abbott Meader","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/e3UvtfZEhrdKpQCae5y0du6vqb1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1964-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Elms","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
