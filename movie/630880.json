I believe the footage was completed before the assassination of Kennedy – an event that changed many things. I had made only silent films until I made THE ELMS, which followed upon this one. SSP is a film whose form I had in mind from the outset. It was to be a visual piece structured in a 'musical' manner. It would have three movements in differing visual 'tempi'. Rhythms, counterpoint, theme and variation, and so on were to be in mind as I filmed and edited. The thematic material would develop slowly, and there would be recapitulations and so on. The three sections are entitled 'Barn', 'Summer Storm', and 'Bird'.  A sense of place, shelter, and fertility. A welcoming of the necessary summer storm of birthing. A child’s wonder and excitement at experiencing the vast unfolding world.\" –Abbott Meader","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oxU2yZhagMjJLrB3Gp6X2Op1GiJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1965-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Summer Storm Passage","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
