In truth Michael was the most gifted of actors, a chameleon who could transform his voice and appearance, and who worked many times in Doctor Who during the 1970’s. Michael loved his time in the programme and appeared in several spin-off dramas including Wartime and Shakedown. In this special production we recall Michael’s life and career in the company of Nicholas Briggs, Peter Miles, and Michael’s son, Andy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4gYGSwM3shvGWgTG8EdI6gVNrio.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51415,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reeltime Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1984-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Myth Makers 1: Michael Wisher","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
