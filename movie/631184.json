The landscape I passed through was the post-Euro 2004 Portugal, with the provisional government of Santana Lopes about to take office. It is a country that still seems like the idea we all have of \"our homeland\", but which actually no longer corresponds to reality and is becoming almost unrecognizable, as in a postcard.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":84435,"logo_path":"/va5P5ZaSRJCSh4H6l220slFKae7.png","name":"Laranja Azul","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Um Pouco Mais Pequeno Que o Indiana","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
