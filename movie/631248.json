The ensuing trial pitted U.S. chief prosecutor and Supreme Court judge Robert Jackson against Hermann GÃ¶ring, the former head of the Nazi air force, whom Adolf Hitler had once named to be his successor. Jackson hoped that the trial would make a statement that crimes against humanity would never again go unpunished. Proving the guilt of the defendants, however, was more difficult than Jackson anticipated.  This American Experience production draws upon rare archival material and eyewitness accounts to recreate the dramatic tribunal that defines trial procedure for state criminals to this day.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hPVL7eFmpx1wqrmdDgxGbmdqQRV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95789,"logo_path":"/w8j9Q7fVkfI7tzoXBUjtDBZ1J3U.png","name":"WGBH Educational Foundation","origin_country":"US"},{"id":6298,"logo_path":"/2pBvKkc9QlFaopszammMmffGWTT.png","name":"Spiegel TV","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":7521,"logo_path":"/fRqMjLjyAqThtEg9P9WKCXLmCpJ.png","name":"National Geographic","origin_country":"US"},{"id":162,"logo_path":"/pIK5tsFVxjoXTJGcd0nYhiL1kn1.png","name":"BR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"American Experience: The Nuremberg Trials","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
