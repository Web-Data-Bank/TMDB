In return, the natural resource suffered from indiscriminate use of the residents themselves and the consequences of rapid urbanization. Recently, the local government have implemented a clearing of all residential structures within the legal easement of the dying lake to pave the way for a tourism master plan that endeavors to balance revenue and environmental protection. In the eve of the clearing operations, film maker Dennis Empalmado documented the final musings of the residents, advocates, and artists whose lives revolved around the 99 hectare crater lake.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fgRd8NFXAw5Xd1BlJTCOQTUq9fX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123046,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pleasant Dreams Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2017-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eldest Among the Seven","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
