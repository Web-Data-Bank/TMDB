His work, essentially composed of black and white engravings, is a cry of rebellion against the tragedies of his time. Forced into exile for his pacifist convictions, he embodied, alongside writers like Stefan Zweig and Romain Rolland, the dream of a cultural and brotherly Europe. Through an imaginary correspondence the director addresses to the artist, the film sketches the portrait of a free, touching man who, throughout his life, attempted to break free of art dealers and put his creations in the hands of all.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nENIudzBhQjpPk3y3qYAxgRPyvM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74735,"logo_path":null,"name":"CBA","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":94970,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Productions du Verger","origin_country":""},{"id":87031,"logo_path":"/lXqLNf7ttr1AIchNgDh27ueMsPf.png","name":"Michigan Films","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":90917,"logo_path":null,"name":"Supermouche Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les mains libres","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
