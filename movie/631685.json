The first girl he meets is actually a troubled prostitute named Champa whom he manages to rescue from the brothel she has been in for some time. He takes her home and in a most typical Hindi film style, announces her as his sister. Along with them lives a crippled middle-aged man. Ganga falls for a beautiful girl named Barkha, and her parents agree to have them married, but alas, Barkha's brother Rakesh identifies Champa and the marriage is cancelled as a result.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uPrl2UHZT0qjthHtpvRcc00zF2L.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1970-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pehchan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
