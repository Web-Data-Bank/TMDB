It had one thousand seats and every night, they were filled. In those days, going to the movies was something special. The cinema was a place where people got dressed up, went on dates, and fell in love. But today, everything has changed. There is a multiplex in every mall and the young generation watch movies on their phone. But at The Scala, time has stood still. The cinema is still run by many of the same staff who have been there from the beginning. It is now the last remaining standalone cinema left in Bangkok. And soon, its time will come to an end too.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/ocF6873GQvRgugFNwldxQekZWNl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79373,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pop Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"2015-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Scala","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
