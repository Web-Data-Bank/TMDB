He was looking for the colleague Cao Xiaomei (Chen Jiaxuan) who had already gone before, and traced the conspiracy of time and space disruption. At the same time, he helped to fall into the dispute between Donglin Academy and Dongchang. The members of the Donglin Academy were murdered one after another. However, there was no clue to the search of the murderer. The eldest brother of the college, Ye Jingqing (Song Tingyi), finally confessed to the imperial court, letting the emperor go to the police to confuse the people and directly point to the East Factory.
