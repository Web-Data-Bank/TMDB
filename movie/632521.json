In it, the dichotomies of day and night, new and old worlds, and nature and culture unfold glacially and immersively. Only at the very end, in the film’s closing credits, does Baumgarten reveal where the compelling and poetic images were shot.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kYMN8SVH0CeRSR32eA8cvGpEde9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1977-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Origin of The Night (Amazon Cosmos)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
