Gallery in New York features a riveting performance by Wilke, who is nude (except for high heeled-shoes) and aiming a gun. As she stalks the performance space like Emma Peel crossed with an exotic dancer, two cameramen follow her, recording her every movement. Dissonant music and a voiceover text about art, violence, power and gender provide the aural counterpoint to her often provocative physical gestures.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"So Help Me Hannah","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
