Even when judged by the often confrontational standards of U.K. punk, the Anti-Nowhere League were a band committed to offending people. Looking less like a group of bohemian rebels than an especially unsavory biker gang eager to stomp someone, the Anti-Nowhere League made an immediate impact when they burst onto the British rock scene in 1980. They were heroes to hard-boiled U.K. punks, and to nearly everyone else they were an affront to all decency - which, of course, made the punks love them all the more.","popularity":1.042,"poster_path":"/s3Z6tFyXwGN9cL6Rgw4o6rtACyx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96317,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cleopatra Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anti-Nowhere League: We Are The League","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":3}
