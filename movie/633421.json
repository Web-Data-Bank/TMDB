Not that it matters, really. Whatever you call the style--\"contemporary instrumental\" seems as good a term as any--Matsui is one of its more appealing, and certainly most popular, exponents.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wdWyl2nivQ0PHmg0ERXqBpIF9t2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Keiko Matsui The Jazz Channel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
