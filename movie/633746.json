For example, a 2003 essay, part of his ongoing project \"Title Variable\" (2001-), also investigates the New Jack Swing genre, and is itself linked to a musical album (both are available on-line; see below). Written in the style of popular music journalism, Price's essay states that \"the entire New Jack Swing venture can be seen as a producer's grab for market share, a way to assimilate an obstreperous but commercially successful youngster into the secure, decades-old structures of popular black music.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nieuw Jacxz Swinjge","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
