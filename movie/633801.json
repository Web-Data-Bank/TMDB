From there Markheim’s sense of reality steadily dissolves in a morass of guilt and shame, until a spectral dog leads him to a shadowy figure who seems to know an awful lot about Markheim and his problems--a fact that, once the figure’s identity is finally revealed, makes a lot of sense.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1972-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Markheim","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
