Said statue, fashioned in the guise of an anguished woman, is seen in a remote inn, having been recently interred from the ground. The occasion is a wedding attended by the protagonist, an unassuming man who becomes caught up in a bizarre nightmare when the groom unthinkingly sticks his wedding ring on a finger of the statue--and can’t get it off!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yJY04Z4DoXoDlXco7TsNCkjwLi7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Venus of Ille","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
