The Rugged Road to Learning dramatizes a day in the life of children who, before consolidation, had to travel through the snowy woods to attend a cold country schoolhouse. Later in the film, a larger, consolidated school encompassing five Ontario country districts is featured favourably. Scenes show happy and lively children who are ready to learn. The use of dramatic scenes to underline a film's message was a common technique by the 1920s. Although this film is far from subtle, it was well understood that \"the great mass of the movie public want to be amused and entertained not instructed, and if they are to be educated it must be in a subtle, delicate manner\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1sfto3t2RIr57Y1XDNY8rALGcnc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1921-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Rugged Road to Learning","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
