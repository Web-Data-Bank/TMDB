One of them is fleeing from the other, sneaking around town like an elusive being, a ghostly presence of uncertain existence. The other character —an injured man carrying a gun— will disrupt the women's way of life in different ways. The whole plot takes place on the fine line between reality and imagination, between dreams and nightmares, fear and desire, within a story shrouded in mystery.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/c5IFrvmZAIBWOm9ZyhFd9DgCacx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":130869,"logo_path":null,"name":"Esnatu Zinema","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2020-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Galician","iso_639_1":"gl","name":"Galego"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Arima","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
