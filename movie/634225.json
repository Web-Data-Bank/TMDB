In this intimate documentary the director observes her gifted nine-year-old son and the way she guides him in the world of gymnastics. She also follows other parents who are in the same top-sport boat, and points the camera at the coach. How do you best support a child, while being a parent and instinctively struggling with the same expectations, stress and disappointments? On the one hand, parents hope their child will excel, but on the other they primarily want a happy child and successes are ‘really’ less important.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/AwvfPfpPmdSCraLt3HcnBGF1caY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":67152,"logo_path":null,"name":"Conijn Film","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2019-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Turn!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
