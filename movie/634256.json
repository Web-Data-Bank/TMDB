His novels, usually settled in Lisbon, are published in prestigious publishers in several countries (Christian Bourgois, Random House, Luchterhand). In Nordlund's film, the characters and scenes from his books constantly interrupt the writer's speech. Lisbon invades his home. The voices of the characters impose themselves to the writer's house. António Lobo Antunes compares his writing to a watercourse that leaves to freely find its way.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5lU1C4Jg1bAYyrTnWp71EOGMGKL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16421,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rosa Filmes","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2009-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"António Lobo Antunes","title":"Writing, Writing, Living","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
