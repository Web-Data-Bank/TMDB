The farmer feeds his pigs and Dennis surreptitiously feeds the monkey on his back. To avoid being dismissed, he helps where possible. For example, by holding the bleeding piglets when they are being neutered. At night, both men retire into a weird darkness. One plays with a curious installation, the other slips into a futuristic psychosis. Until a new day dawns.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4qYhXGDCYxnvkMNx6TgSSdnZGF6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114161,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rots Filmwerk","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2019-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Your Beautiful Rubber Brain","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
