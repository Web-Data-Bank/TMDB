The sight of those fifty jumbo jet landing lights, lit all at once or flashing in time with the music, or the amazing new laser effects, left audiences stunned and delighted and in no doubt at all that this was indeed a world class band.” They had also become a very tight outfit and the show was taped for an official release, which never materialised.
