Since its premiere alongside The Great Blondino and other shorts in April 1967, the film has rarely been seen. It stands out as a more textural piece from Nelson, which, rather than retreating into pure abstraction or bland trippiness, subtly transmits an undercurrent of its ominous source material. â€”Mark Toscano","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1967-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Penny Bright & Jimmy Witherspoon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
