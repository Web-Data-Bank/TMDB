The action shifts then to the ground, where the images of several men stripped to the waist (including the artist Plinio Martelli) blend with those of two nude women dancing in the surface of a mirror work by Pistoletto himself, inspired by a famous photographic sequence of Eadweard Muybridge.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1968-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La vestizione","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
