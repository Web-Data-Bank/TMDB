But when her romantic and filmmaking partner, Dennis, passed away suddenly, Thomas' work took on a much deeper meaning as she grappled with grief while continuing her project.  This sensitive and deeply personal film, featuring many local subjects, ruminates on love and loss and the power of film to explore the most unanswerable of questions.","popularity":0.692,"poster_path":"/vX2i4j645TAeWafLRRHZKr7Hgxq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My First and Last Film","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
