This illegal trade is a lucrative one, yet many of the half a million Moroccans farming the crop live between poverty and fear. Shot in North Africa through to Europe, this doc investigates the lives of farmers who make it; the Western consumers who drive it; and the tangled web of business and politics behind the world’s largest exporter of cannabis resin.  “Fixers and farmers have been arrested previously for working with the media. I heard of another Western film crew who tried to investigate this story but gave up.” Producer & reporter Emir Nader speaks about the challenges of making the film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6HzA2bjAJ274NmLlRPQvtwCrArv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Who’s Getting Rich from Moroccan Hash?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
