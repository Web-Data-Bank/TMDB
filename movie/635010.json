Trying to avoid the usual hum-drum approach, she becomes involved with a strange gang with a blind beggar for a leader, Linos, a former teacher, and current idol, of hers, who seems to Theodora like a modern Oedipus. Linos' companion and right-hand man is the former caretaker of the school. The group is completed by two sister-hookers, Anta and Mina, who work in a brothel housed in the school building and who sometimes force Linos to beg for money. The gang is planning a \"big score\", the theft of the antiquities of Plato's Academy, but Theodora's reluctance, combined with the timely intervention of the police, cancel the plan.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8WfypxOVQRnpxnthpgbSYegmpH1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123518,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aigokeros","origin_country":"GR"},{"id":76050,"logo_path":null,"name":"FASMA EPE","origin_country":""},{"id":7254,"logo_path":"/x5m947rMvwJbNpoGil5W76dIJjB.png","name":"Greek Film Centre","origin_country":"GR"},{"id":7255,"logo_path":"/aHu0SirjV9Mi0OrlnFWqZwy50wW.png","name":"EPT","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"1998-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Enigma","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
