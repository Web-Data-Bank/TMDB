The fight marks Pacquiao's second defense of the 147-pound title he won from Miguel Cotto in 2009. The first came against Josh Clottey in March 2010, after which Pacquiao moved up and beat Antonio Margarito for a vacant super welterweight title last November. That victory made Pacquiao the first boxer to capture world championships in eight different weight classes (from 112 to 154).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1xHAHFJkAcHLMK40XZSw4bBWhQU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pacquiao vs. Mosley","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
