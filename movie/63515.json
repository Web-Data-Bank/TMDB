One day, the band received a microphone as the present from a mysterious fan. Miraculously, the microphone was a time-machine that accidentally took them to the future, in 2007, where the modern music rules and they're just an out-of-date item. The only way to bring them back to their glorious time is performing a concert to energize the microphone, the time-machine. But, before the concert could be set, there're still some problems in the new world that they have to deal with.","popularity":0.649,"poster_path":"/rXNkLcLmiLdr8nluDVQ8NMbsI1e.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5369,"logo_path":"/tjuwCtH2mVCEFCYBT6CTytdiqot.png","name":"GMM Tai Hub (GTH)","origin_country":"TH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"2006-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Possible","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":4}
