If the people knew about the deception, they would revolt and overthrow the corrupt government. One patriot in office steals the proof and must make it out of the country. He gets assistance from a local rebel leader who is in charge of a motley group of fighters called the Shanghai 13. Not all of them can be trusted, as some of them will turn in the government official. Our weak protagonist must run a gauntlet of the who's who already mentioned.","popularity":3.36,"poster_path":"/27cYfrVy4d9zW7C37esQ49wRzIa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72762,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hong Kong-China Chang He Film Co.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"1984-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shanghai 13","video":false,"vote_average":5.938,"vote_count":8}
