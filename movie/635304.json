The basic idea (and not so simple challenge) comprises maintaining an erection for hours through the energy of friction, which (spoiler alert!) is not always possible. stiffness seems simple at first glance but is a cunning undertaking fluctuating between narcissism and self-demolition, frenzy and wasteland, self-satisfaction and self-torture (Stefan Grissemann).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u6ZufUKykxTYjybg7dhYU9miQCS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":67822,"logo_path":null,"name":"sixpackfilm","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"stiffness 1 – 3 / 7","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
