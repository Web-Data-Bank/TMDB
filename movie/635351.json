His father, Bradley, is ashamed of his injuries; remembering what a 'hero' he used to be to his son. He tries to reconnect with Alex but cannot get close without scaring him. It is only after Alex grows suspicious of the masked Strangerâ€™s somewhat familiar behaviour and eventually catches a glimpse of his eyes through a gap in the bandages that he can recognise his father immediately; the wounds disappear and it becomes clear that there is a bond that runs far deeper than that which lies on the surface.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/l4b89ZSHoowT7MrDZW4ak7nvAWS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A five-year-old boy is haunted by a silent masked monster as he tries to locate his missing father.","title":"Stranger","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
