A young student, Ma Jie, who is sent to a tiny Beigao village in Shanxi Province and has the mundane task of watching over livestock during the Great Cultural Revolution. Surrounded only by the extreme boredom, he initiates a war against two donkeys. What ensues as a result, is an impressive feature debut by director Li Dawei who manages to infuse a believable quirky and black humorous universe within a realistically grim setting.","popularity":1.212,"poster_path":"/pw7yjIiETk1hhcCjMCIu8F3H93.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":147479,"logo_path":null,"name":"北京天寰新宇国际传媒有限公司","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2009-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Tale of Two Donkeys","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":2}
