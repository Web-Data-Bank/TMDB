The characters in the film are very different people, like all of us. But they are united by a common problem - HIV infection. Some of the heroes have a positive status, some do not, but they give all their strength to cope with the HIV epidemic in Russia, while others have to learn about their HIV status in front of the video camera. All of them - ordinary average dads and mothers, homosexuals and heterosexuals, psychologists and doctors, former drug users and adherents of a healthy lifestyle - are near you and among you.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7ccgQy3HGwI8VMFVLgmYH1rZLy9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2016-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Positive","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
