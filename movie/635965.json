Built with four frames within one, half of the screen in motion, the other still, this film makes the viewer feel that they are watching a \"moving picture.\" The sensation one gets is of tension...expectation...shock. It freezes one in a frame. The glorious, trenchant music of R. Murray Schafer in the background further adds to the intense \"high\" of the film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/honeNfi8WpkTnb5a1QRJdwNNV0k.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Visions","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
