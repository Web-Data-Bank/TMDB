Those awkward moments we've all had, and the emotions we all experience - rejection, romantic challenges, disappointment, wanting something more. It all takes place during a thought-provoking car ride home after a date. It follows a young gay professional, Simon; a frustrated hopeless romantic who's ready for something different. He's on the brink of giving up on the search for love; perhaps he's looking in the wrong places. With a little help from an unexpected source, he has a change in direction.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/l0PxFbmwUNHnknXfB6I65StwXia.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-06-03","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"That's Me on the Right","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
