The title refers to Siva/Shiva – god of the dance – who dances the world into both destruction and rebirth, and Charivari, pronounced 'Shivaree', a rude serenade to mock wedding couples -i.e. mocking the concept of passion in balance with serenity. The film’s dancing child is our daughter Jennifer, now a middle aged school teacher and a likely Bodhisattva. She dances to escape and dispel the fragmentary seductions of TV, with its chaos of sound and image. Moving toward a window and the light, she sees and ponders the wind in the trees, as the final notes of Bill Evans’ 'Peace Piece' linger and fade.\" –Abbott Meader","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fJLJxGbJruoBzAIbbTRa4vJm1fR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1968-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shiva Ree","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
