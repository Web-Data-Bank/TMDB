A fog, a bit harder than the air – the dust of stones.  A hexagonal structure, like a monolith of which one dare not ask questions.  Two hundred kilometres from Beijing I found a sculpture factory where men lived amidst rocks that were waiting to be broken, cut, polished.  The same gestures come back again and again to write a history of deterioration and repair.  This history is obliterated in the making of monuments. With the wind that inexorably scatters the traces of these actions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3HaSV4JDlKJq0tkzNF4Lsm1eB98.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11687,"logo_path":null,"name":"Le Fresnoy","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2019-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All Movements Should Kill the Wind","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
