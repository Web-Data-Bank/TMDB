What I find most intriguing is that people generally take the story to be a child's tale. For me, the film has always had an underlying darkness – an evil that runs deeper than the Wicked Witch and resides beneath the polished surface. In Once in a Lullaby, I strive to bring out this darkness and impart an altered version of Dorothy’s dream, which in this case is more of a beautiful nightmare. I recommend listening to it with a nice pair of headphones or versatile speakers.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/khfn0y8bGTh7PE8U584uSCz6vHs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Once in a Lullaby","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
