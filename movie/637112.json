The host of “Panorama” at the time of filming is caught on camera casually using racist and homophobic slurs during a £220 champagne lunch with the same ex-employee they had planned to coach for a fake interview in which the BBC would possibly edit in which to make it appear as, “a gender, a sexual thing against Tommy Robinson,” according to the host.  Within 24 hours of releasing the film, social media giant Facebook made a public statement of their own and removed Tommy Robinson’s accounts permanently.","popularity":0.908,"poster_path":"/8Fm7lOWGQOo3RiOyVQarhj4hUQm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":123750,"logo_path":"/j1YpesMgiUnkzYLO2jiZS3brkfp.png","name":"TR News","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Facebook deleted me because of this video…","title":"Panodrama","video":false,"vote_average":9.3,"vote_count":3}
