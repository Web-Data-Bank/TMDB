Once in the lab, scientists scoop out the alien brains and chuck them into a harvester which extracts and records the final memory so it can be viewed at a later date. The end result: a Cerebral Print. A group of government agents try their damnedest to keep the program a secret while the little grey bastards attempt to probe their way to freedom. This is a compilation of Cerebral Print Files.","popularity":0.676,"poster_path":"/2pWdTESiqdQk1cty4BBeM2UI4Rk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cerebral Print: The Secret Files","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
