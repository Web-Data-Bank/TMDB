As a rare photogenic character - he has a background as a photo model in New York and Milan - he has won two World Cup medals for Denmark. He is an old-fashioned rider type with no agent. He uses his father and his close surroundings to sit up to the races. His driving force has been the madness itself. It has been like living with a psychopath, his wife says. But now Matti is approaching the end of the career. No one needs a winner who no longer wins, he admits. In this intimate portrait, we get very close to anger and loneliness, hiding in it so welcoming face.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-07-16","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forsvindingsnummeret - Matti Breschel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
