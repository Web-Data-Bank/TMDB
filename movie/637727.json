Despite the movementâ€™s contribution to the political awareness of the Iranian middle class, the New-Wave films, along with all other pre-revolutionary titles, were banned due to their non-conformity to the severely restrictive censorship codes imposed by the Islamic government after the 1979 Revolution. The ban has effectively shelved half a century of film heritage in Iran.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lost Cinema: Iranian Political Films in the 70s","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
