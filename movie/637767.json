Exposing the revulsion from common humanity in George Bernard Shaw, Ezra Pound, D. H. Lawrence, E. M. Forster, Virginia Woolf, H. G. Wells, Aldous Huxley, W. B. Yeats and other canonized writers, he relates this to the cult of the Nietzschean Superman, which found its ultimate exponent in Hitler.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Menace of the Masses","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
