His great-grandfather's kind and gentle influence on Andie was so strong that, upon entering military service, the boy was unable to cope with the tyranny of Captain Yefremov, a man whose numerous personal problems and hang-ups had turned him into a vindictive and merciless fiend. One day, in an alcoholic stupor, the Captain pulled a gun on Andie, accidentally shooting and killing him. During the investigation the Captain blamed the 'accident' on Andie's carelessness in handling arms. Six months later Andrey Petrovich learned the horrific truth behind the incident from one of his great grandson's friends on being demobilized from the military.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bCosUG3c1XJlE2m75TSaqCkEsEv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2011-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Old Man","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
