Periodically the motion stops, replaced by selective focus on a grainy object, creating a sense of wave motion in and out of the screen. This film is concerned with the projected, not just light or the emulsion or the illusion or the projector or the camera, but all of them. The surface of the film, the grain, is remembered when a similar but illusionistic surface appears (just a magnified), crossing the fram. Other times the grain is left to itself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"White Revolved","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
