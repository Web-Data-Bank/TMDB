Riffel took an episode of The Andy Griffith Show and Bonanza replacing the dialogue with what Riffel believes are words and music that are more along the lines of what today's TV viewers are used to. This was the first movie that Riffel wrote to be used for charity. Despite being Part 5, it is actually the fourth movie in the series to be released to the public.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/te5RvCPgqwsMHJmTBx9VhtbOrSV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Night Of The Day Of The Dawn Of The Son Of The Bride Of The Return Of The Revenge Of The Terror Of The Attack Of The Evil, Mutant, Hellbound, Flesh-Eating, Crawling, Alien, Zombified, Subhumanoid Living Dead — Part 5","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
