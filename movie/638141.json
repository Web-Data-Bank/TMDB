She proceeds to terrorize the neighbors, tripping two men hauling large cartons by ensnaring them with pieces of string. She drops a pumpkin on a shopkeeper’s head, ties someone’s furniture to a moving vehicle, and then explodes fireworks inside a plumber’s protruding drainpipe. He puts out the flames in a tailspin by jumping into the river.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/438c67UgKGsGgFlLOK0OlLJd9fH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":170270,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1911-08-04","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Léontine, the Troublemaker","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
