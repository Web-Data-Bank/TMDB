Rather, as an animal’s night call, it exists vanishing in its own closure and muteness. The film reestablishes itself onto its state of unsolved, lost and forgotten space, as a word without name, experiencing itself as a simple gesture, dreamily suspended through its own electric tension, far from any sort of destination, salvation, redemption.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fetgFVCh13wR2DfLtTEPsIgaiDc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2019-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Saved Night","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
