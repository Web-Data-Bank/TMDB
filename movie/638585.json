Her love appears to be unrequited, though, because the major thinks she is far too young--and also, unknown to her, because he had once been in love with her mother. When a fellow passenger on the ship takes advantage of the naive girl the major comes to her rescue, but in the process the girl finds out about the past relationship between he and her mother.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qlTEt4BihEJibl3h5WWJKs81VnZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33,"logo_path":"/8lvHyhjr8oUKOOy2dKXoALWKdp0.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1925-04-12","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dangerous Innocence","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
