Petipa’s Raymonda Act III is Russian classical ballet summarized in one act, full of sparkle and precise technique, while Ashton’s Enigma Variations is quintessentially British in every way – from its score by Elgar and period designs by Julia Trevelyan Oman, to Ashton’s signature style, the essence of British ballet. Concerto, MacMillan’s fusion of classical technique with a contemporary mind, completes a programme that shows the breadth of the Company’s heritage.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gD6rrLFMAKaiUSzrhEFe3fOAVjd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11514,"logo_path":"/uC4LtXWXfuDleivpGYSOsl8veXN.png","name":"Royal Opera House","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":142,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Concerto / Enigma Variations / Raymonda Act III (Royal Ballet)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
