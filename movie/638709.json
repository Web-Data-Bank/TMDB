As a member of The Last Poets, a group of performance poets who expressed the progressive spirit of the times starting in the late 1960s, he was a major influence on later hip-hop artists. In one of his best-known pieces, Ni****s are Scared of Revolution, he criticizes his black brothers’ destructive, macho behavior.  Scared of Revolution concentrates on Hassan’s personal life, in which he still fights his demons. He grew up poor with a violent, unpredictable father, which in turn left him with an inferiority complex. In the course of his adult life, he has had a string of bad relationships and left children without a father figure. In his darkest hour, he also battled a crack addiction.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tLReezwxUaajqbL648NUzSOQleU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Untold Story of the Godfather of Rap","title":"Scared of Revolution","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
