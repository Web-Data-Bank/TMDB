Some of the greatest jazz musicians in any style - from blues and boogie-woogie to bebop and beyond - rise to the challenge, in these intimate and exciting jazz solo sessions. Guitarist Kelly Joe Phelps, a brilliant improviser, is known for his ability to put a new spin on a song every time he plays in his unique delta blues-meets-jazz style. The guitarist, who started out playing mainly the bass, has taken his cues from jazz legends such as Ornette Coleman, Miles Davis, and John Coltrane, and mixes their influence with an inimitable sense for the blues.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":123996,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stingray Djazz","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2018-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kelly Joe Phelps - Solo Session","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
