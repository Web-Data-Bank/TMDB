Many believe that a specifically Russian approach to design does not exist. But what if they underestimate the influence of culture, history and surrounding reality on the style and aesthetic guidelines of those who shape our visual environment? Natasha Klimchuk, Tim Cherny and Olya Morozova, leaders of the Bang Bang Education online design school, have assembled a company of 33 contemporary Russian designers. Among them are many famous names: Artemy Lebedev, Valery Golyzhenkov, Pokras Lampas, Anton Schneider, Denis Bashev, Oleg Pashchenko. They all speak and think in Russian and are inevitably inspired by what has become part of our everyday life, books, practices, rituals, holidays, economics, historical memory and fashion. With the help of these 33 guides, the almanac will try to find the features and boundaries of our national perception of beauty and look at what ethical and aesthetic values ​​we carry to the world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mouDoeVCiE0IU87o7NoHYMdCp3o.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":124974,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bang Bang Education","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2019-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"33 Words About Design","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
