Photographic and cinema archives are essentially archives of light, of timeless moments drawn with light. Relics of Lumen draws on the Black Star photography collection, archived at Ryerson Image Centre in Toronto, and on NASAâ€™s digital archives. It combines thousands of still and moving images captured over the last century of people in travel (tourists, explorers, immigrants, refugees, and migrant workers), and technologies of transport and communication, while simultaneously reminding us of the persistent human desire for discovery, adventure, travel, and conquest.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kHpL16Ic3qGqAGJ2hIGh0lSxxpj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":96056,"logo_path":"/o2VlzDYQZyqPnaXx5dyyQ0I1ML1.png","name":"Toronto Metropolitan University","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Relics of Lumen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
