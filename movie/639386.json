One exception is the film \"The Master of Time\", directed by Kamal El Sheikh in 1987. In this film, the main character, a scientist named Mr. Kamel, is obsessed with the idea of immortality. Through radical editing, Lebanese artist and filmmaker Rania Stephan captures the quintessence of this obsession. In her film, she eliminates all fictional elements from the original and retains only the transition shots featuring doors, gates, and all forms of crossing and passing through.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2ZMtdaR284Nfg3vsyBUC31mJefD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Threshold","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
