Since nodding to Edward’s proposal, she has been pushed beyond limits by unaffordable housing, archaic customs, and intrusive in-laws. What befuddles her further is the reappearance of Shuwei, a mainlander she’s supposed to be divorced from out of a sham marriage that solved her coming-of-age hardship. Zeroing in on nuts and bolts of modern marriage, My Prince Edward pokes around fixated correlations of freedom with relationship status and geographic residence. Like a breath of fresh air out of the breathless space it navigates, the whimsical gem contributes a rare humane take on the worldly metropolis's divisions with humor and wisdom.","popularity":1.388,"poster_path":"/5hYDlKJ69aQfvei1dLjaLMZD6zW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":140463,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Development Fund of Hong Kong","origin_country":""},{"id":85306,"logo_path":null,"name":"Golden Scene","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2020-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Prince Edward","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":15}
