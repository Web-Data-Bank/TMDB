Under-privileged and oppressed, Chu almost consistently runs into conflicts with the merciless law enforcers, as well as the blood-thirsty press. The film also depicts her bonding with two other persons: a 10-year-old AD/HD kid and Ling, her long-time crippled mate whom everyone believes to be her husband but what lies behind is a Platonic relationship of secret intimacy and loving care. Chu’s story also affects the young soul of the ambitious and fame-driven reporter, Heidi.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/szr4Kre7URRImcNPPDSV7tSseoU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":69437,"logo_path":null,"name":"One Cool Film Production","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"A Life of Papers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
