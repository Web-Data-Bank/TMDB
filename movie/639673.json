Rembert, who lived on a plantation, joined the civil rights movement as a teen and was put to work on a chain gang, is a rare survivor of a lynching attempt. Decades later, he still carries the scars. “That lynching is on my back, and it’s dragging me down, even today,” he says. As he etches the history, bloodsoaked and cruel, into leatherwork, fellow artist Dr. Shirley Jackson Whitaker organizes a different kind of ceremony to search for healing. “It’s not just black history,” she says. “This is American history.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nBsoWZqu7krf0wpvUZCvtv7diop.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ashes to Ashes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
