With a cast made up of real-life villagers from the area where the events took place, the detailed re-enactments and careful attention to the gestures of their ancestors serve to create an intense and sometimes disturbing atmosphere of hyper-realism. Details of the crime and of the trial that followed are told from varied perspectives, including the written confession of Pierre himself, and form a rich and complex narrative that interrogates the concepts of “truth” and “history”.","popularity":1.245,"poster_path":"/kRo4KojIzJ3Wf4pPXL93ne3cQ4g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127798,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films de l'Arquebuse","origin_country":""},{"id":22642,"logo_path":"/gqFSMOsv68FkYalHrKbUvq3pGwh.png","name":"Ina","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":77182,"logo_path":null,"name":"Polsim Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":6849,"logo_path":"/AjdOGHRLAhWbP1aAga85A9EOfD2.png","name":"SFP","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1976-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":130,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I, Pierre Rivière, Having Slaughtered My Mother, My Sister and My Brother…","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":8}
