There is no story development like a normal story movie, and the image of only the author = the hero like a diary movie continues. There are no lines. The heroine-like existence is a dingy female stray cat. Still, I tried to brew and elaborate how to make a movie time of about one hour, like walking a tightrope, but over a long period of time. As a reference motif, there is Isao Yamada's early work \"Yomado\". The title \"Gootariputra\" is not a word with a specific meaning, but is just a coined word of  Lazy way of life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/i75P5AroFg0tZmGlOjzgerZNPGL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1999-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"GOOTARIPUTRA","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
