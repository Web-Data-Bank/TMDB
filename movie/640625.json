In the 1960s he developed a theatre method which he called the “Theatre of the Oppressed,” which results in a socially liberating experience. His method redefined the relationship between the actors and spectators in that spectators are urged to emancipate and liberate themselves from their passive role. The film illustrates what this means in practice using various theatre groups from all over the world, including Switzerland, as an example.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2013-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Augusto Boal","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
