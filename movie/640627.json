Having been wrenched away from the country in which they had lived and from their children because they had no papers, they are found again in Senegal or Kosovo, in Gambia or Cameroun, destitute and cut off from their families, sometimes even having been tortured upon arrival. This film broaches the private lives of these broken men and testifies to the brutality of a migration policy that is common in Switzerland and in Europe.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dDqE72pR8x8CtFcMv9voCqrD2LP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21530,"logo_path":null,"name":"Climage","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":16661,"logo_path":null,"name":"ARTE GEIE","origin_country":""},{"id":13668,"logo_path":"/azhapBvZ8g1UWyyQQhhcRR9bM9x.png","name":"RTS","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2013-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le monde est comme ça","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
