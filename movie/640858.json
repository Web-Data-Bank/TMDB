This allows me to explore a whole range of emotions and feelings, and be able to show them with greater depth by taking us away from the direct environment in which this abuse takes place, and put us somewhere close enough to still reach out to it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xKda87TGuN8A5fEcvLqoLcknB7w.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A lonely, detached young man lives next to a family who are stuck in a violent relationship, the effects of which begin to take its toll on his consciousness.","title":"Cleaver","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
