But behind the frumpy facade, Evelyn enjoys a new career as a break-out bestselling author under the pseudonym Maxine Powers-- a secret she's too shy to reveal. When handsome novelist Drew McClintock signs on as her company's newest contract star, Evelyn knows that she must become someone else to win Drew's affections. And thus Maxine Powers comes to life as Evelyn gives herself a complete makeover, and assumes a brand new persona as the mysterious and sexy writer. However, she doesn't have everyone fooled, and a jealous coworker is out to reveal Maxine's true identity and ruin both her career and her chance at love.
