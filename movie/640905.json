Even better than their all-conquering neighbours, Liverpool! They won the FA Cup, thrashed Man Utd 5-0, beat Liverpool, home and away, and then strolled to the league title with a record amount of points. They steamrollered the great Bayern Munich and won a first ever European trophy and, for a time, were probably the best side in Europe. We will never know for sure - because they couldn't prove it...  This is the tale of a man with Everton in his blood, a team intent on greatness and a city united in defiance. A story told by all the heroes of the day - the men that made history.","popularity":0.723,"poster_path":"/eS7DK442p8a8nEL3EvRZyD48qd5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127627,"logo_path":null,"name":"Toffee Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The definitive story of Everton FC at the very peak of their powers in the mid-1980s","title":"Everton: Howard's Way","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
