He knows each burly man who comes in for a mid-dance piss break, and his dad is playing the fiddle in the band. But Dan, his visiting boyfriend, couldn’t be further out of place – and there’s something Rory hasn’t told him. Once Rory manages to coax him out the cubicle, previously unaddressed questions over masculinity and communication are brought to the fore and their conversation unfurls into a flaming row, paused at regular intervals by urinating family friends, and incongruously underscored throughout by the rising ceilidh music coming through the wall.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pB8uffd39mptENCpEgvyAqjIqSB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Scene from the Men's Toilets at a Ceilidh","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
