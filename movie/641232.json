But it may be too late to salvage either.  Franz Schreker was a popular composer in the early decades of the 20th century, until his music was banned by the Nazis because he was of Jewish background. Der ferne Klang, his first major work, is a late Romantic opera of grand passions. Director Christof Loy is back at the Royal Swedish Opera with a production set in a dreamlike mise en sc√®ne.","popularity":0.603,"poster_path":"/gYVFOB8nnLyYE1EV8262lmiJiim.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der ferne Klang","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
