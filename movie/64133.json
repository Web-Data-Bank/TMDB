Occasionally, the director comments about the characters or their motivations, and sometimes the actor does. That's all -- there is no action, there are no location shots, no one pretends to be anything else. The script itself tells about an encounter between a blank-slate of a woman hitchhiker, and a communist truck driver. As the reading progresses, Duras comments bitterly about the failed ideals of communism and the glorious revolution that will probably never happen.","popularity":1.72,"poster_path":"/93knueN8tjQ3jAe8NrYFbivGi2I.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107193,"logo_path":null,"name":"Auditel","origin_country":""},{"id":55321,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinéma 9","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1977-05-27","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lorry","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":14}
