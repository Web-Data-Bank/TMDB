By zooming into the microcosm of the girl's life, this short film endeavors to portray the larger story of Kashmir and the negotiations the people in any contested territory have to make in order to deal with the fissures in their geographical and personal identities. As a conscious act of resistance against the infidelity of language, there are no dialogues in the film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/r25O0hS8U7Vz2z8dpgVZAQvp71s.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2018-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Stitch","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
