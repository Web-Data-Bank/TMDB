Why do poetry today and how ? Sitting behind his desk, Michel Deguy, great living poet, speaks, smokes and thinks with the same generous enthusiasm. Marie-Claude Treilhou records the thinking words, articulates their development through a series of readings or sung recitations of the poems dissected by their author. Fathoming the depths of “ecopoeticology” of Deguy, Comme si, comme ça makes up the most sober and vivid of portraits. “Without ever bragging”, as suggested by the contemporary ethics the poet formulates in the film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wZ1C6MXTu08cRI5jypU8efxVO52.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Comme si, comme ça","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
