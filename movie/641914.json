Pursuers ever on their tail, their story guides us through the magnificent Northern landscape, now tattered with the remnants of war and broken industry. On their journey they come across other people, all challenged in their humanity as they try to survive in a Norway that is no longer a land of plenty. The boys must balance brotherhood and ruthless pragmatism. Their childhood is already gone.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ofqeGK89e7EGVBx4cOGrD1HOemd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":124471,"logo_path":"/bHmjb9B8qoRG1D4pIHfqB6nW8Ek.png","name":"Morrdi Produksjon","origin_country":"NO"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2013-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Nordland 2060","title":"Nordland - On Overgrown Paths","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
