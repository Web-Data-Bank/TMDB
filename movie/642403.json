Listen as this great conductor produces musical nuisances that are unique to his art and how he accompanies the soloists with understanding and rapport. I have no hesitation in claiming this is one of the great recordings of the century.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dQ6oQ2e3urhHGiAwqdDdqyloeqw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10707,"logo_path":"/cxWvdB6JoV1YVNno4VCg3yceoXG.png","name":"Deutsche Grammophon","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A peaceful requiem","title":"Karajan Brahms En Deutsches Requiem","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
