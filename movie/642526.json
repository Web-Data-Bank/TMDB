(Comedians and Singers)","overview":"Do I Look Like a Lady? (Comedians and Singers) presents a dynamic checkerboard of moving image footage featuring African-American actors and singers from across the 20th century: from Jackie “Moms” Mabley to Eartha Kitt, Whoopi Goldberg, Whitney Houston, and several others. The video focuses on their individual voices as they express heartbreaking roles, pointed lyrics, sharp jokes, and strong statements of resistance to the dominant culture. The work is a powerful, and often riotous, reflection on the roles of black women in the United States.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7V5Z82duvJbyVorVwHhLgpbHPSe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Afar","iso_639_1":"aa","name":""},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Do I Look Like a Lady?
