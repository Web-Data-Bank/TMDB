Controlled by the sticks and strings of their human operators, including the artist herself, the figures moving within a shadow puppet-like theater space remind us of the manipulation of historical oppression and the powerlessness of the oppressed while also emphasizing the theatricality of the film itself. Themes of race, gender, sexuality, and violence intersect and unfold on Kara Walker’s multi-colored stage.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bnxjA3toIBj1qo5eOyRC1tu2NZg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"National Archives Microfilm Publication M999 Roll 34: Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen and Abandoned Lands: Six Miles from Springfield on the Franklin Road","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
