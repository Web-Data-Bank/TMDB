But rather than focusing on the expected hysteria Luc Schaedler’s documentary debut works towards complexity by allowing six diverse residents to talk about their relationship to the colonial city. Their life stories beautifully mix with the images of the author. Made in Hong Kong is a very personal portrait of a city in transition and we learn about Hong Kong’s ambiguities and its political and social problems, as well as the uncertainties regarding the time after 1997.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/bG7y73BdxLCvxkFKOAb58Wkvg8E.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":156854,"logo_path":null,"name":"go between films GmbH","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The film Made in Hong Kong allows glimpses on a Hong Kong shortly before the 1997 handover to China.","title":"Made in Hong Kong","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":3}
