Nicolas’ Gidget is a self-absorbed young white woman who remains clueless to the violence erupting around her, ultimately to her own peril.  The film asks whether such police brutality would be tolerated if the victim were a middle-class white woman.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/x3XvRxDysAfdGkb0AHyut4hVPFd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10250,"logo_path":null,"name":"UCLA School of Film and Television","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1980-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gidget Meets Hondo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
