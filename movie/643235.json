He never overstates, which is lovely. Best of all, they remind me that they (for my money) are the best of the Liszt keyboard compositions. It is good to see the ease with which he plays. No flash, just wonderfully constructed music. They remind me of the same expert expression the composer brought to his Petrach songs.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ms7rUjcWgLPpgQ9Uk6ffgPguDxH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10707,"logo_path":"/cxWvdB6JoV1YVNno4VCg3yceoXG.png","name":"Deutsche Grammophon","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Highly recommended","title":"Liszt Annees de Pelerinage","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
