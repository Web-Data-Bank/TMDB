When he was a child, he imagined the only he couldn’t see were the dark nights; just like a game of hide and seek with his eyes blindfolded; the echoes of countdown still rings in his ear, the only thing that didn’t bore him were the sounds of the world. Music opened another road for him, and with music he was given a miracle that took him out of that closeted space and out into the world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hupABnNNxU5yP25tAcgU5pkutHG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26492,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jet Tone Films","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2007-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The End of the Tunnel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
