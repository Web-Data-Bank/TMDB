Following 20 sold out shows in Los Angeles, his Sagayn tour took him to Yerevan, Beirut, Istanbul, Paris, Sydney, Cyprus, Geneva and a dozen other cities.\r Four years have passed since Sagayn and Berberian is thrilled about his new monologue. “I love writing, painting and directing, but being alone on that stage is a completely different sensation. I feel empowered, because there’s nothing more difficult than getting up on a stage and trying to make people laugh for an hour and a half. If you fail, you can’t blame anyone else for your failure and you’ll be crushed, but if you succeed, you feel exhilarated,” says Berberian.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iy4SMdGbdYd9kwDXWeZ7DU49Sgk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60799,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wet Paint","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A funny, witty look on anxiety","title":"Yeté","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
