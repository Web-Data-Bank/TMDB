The material removed is processed and returned to nature through forest liming. This measure attempts to counteract acid rain that troubles the forest floor. A cycle like a Mobius strip – an irreversible consequence due to the mining materials in order to restore the fragile natural balance. Lime dust delicately dusts the forest floor. A white, spherical alternative world opens, questioning our ambivalent relationship to nature.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wx8Q9KknS9KrAhRrfWfuGXMsg5t.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12346,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mitteldeutsche Medienförderung (MDM)","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":159386,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hochschule Harz","origin_country":""},{"id":143669,"logo_path":null,"name":"Werkleitz Gesellschaft","origin_country":""},{"id":159387,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kunststiftung Sachsen-Anhalt","origin_country":""},{"id":115939,"logo_path":null,"name":"RosenPictures","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kaltes Tal","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
