Ivy (Abigail Mac) and her boyfriend Nick (Seth Gamble) have a sinister ulterior motive: to sacrifice the unsuspecting Regan (Gina Valentina) and her boyfriend in order to unleash an evil entity from the cursed forest. The ritual, however, summons not one, but two powerful demons: the perverse Incubus (Xander Corvus) and sexy Succubus (Romi Rain). After awakening from a millennia-long slumber, the dastardly duo plan to fuck and kill anyone who stands in their way, until they can walk amongst the living as immortal beings.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/f64O27fyuaSoKIwSjUk4hnWLmsy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6112,"logo_path":"/qyaL5C9wEIUYJOoF84mttDjLbH2.png","name":"Digital Playground","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":151,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Summoning","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":3}
