The champagne flows as guests waltz the night away, but several of them have something to hide.  This internationally renowned production by Otto Schenk takes the audience on a bumpy ride through all kinds of intrigues, clothing mix-ups and mistaken identities, until we finally reach a rather hung-over happy ending. Conducted by Franz Welser-Möst and streamed on Strauss’ birthday, this performance is part of OperaVision’s events celebrating the inaugural World Opera Day on 25 October 2019.","popularity":0.603,"poster_path":"/oPMSxLwJvHPflVM7Ek64d5rq9OG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die Fledermaus - WIENER STAATSOPER","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
