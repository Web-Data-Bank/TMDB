The film is also the director's bow to the victims of the darkest chapter of Austria's recent history. A chapter that seems to have been extended to a certain extent when it comes to restitution of looted property to the descendants of Holocaust victims.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/m7prlt9ULagUZe544HY8o3yMxMw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":124723,"logo_path":null,"name":"Burgl Czeitschner Filmproduktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2018-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Let's Keep It","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
