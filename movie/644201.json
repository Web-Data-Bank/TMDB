On the surface, it appears that the struggle between Tony and Joe, two best friends who both love Emily, hinges on Joe obtaining an annulment of his first marriage, so Emily, a devout Catholic, can marry him. As they each fight for whom they love, the Tribunal slowly answers the ever-present question hanging over the proceedings, \"What does God want?\" Why it matters to these three is the reason it matters to every person. Our souls will not rest until they rest in the arms of the Lord.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/63k1UzAdMDeovkkOeGV4wQtWk6v.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128286,"logo_path":null,"name":"St. Michael Movies","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Their Love Depends On It","title":"The Tribunal","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":2}
