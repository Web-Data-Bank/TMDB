Yet in one corner stands a more intimate group of buildings and gardens—one that has lain unused and virtually untouched for more than two hundred years. This film takes us on a fascinating journey into a world where only the most perfect and beautiful work could be offered to an Emperor—a standard that the modern world is hard-pressed to equal. The revelation is that supreme skills and traditional materials may be rare, but they do still exist, if the will exists to seek them out. The search ends in triumph—and watching this remarkable and intricate treasure come back to life is an unforgettable experience.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mKx3bgZAE9JdQhUCBAv91wgrPvM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-08-05","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Emperor's Secret Garden","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
