It is a poetic account of a country, as Belabbes, an eccentric figure in Moroccan cinema, records the extent to which larger social and political change has—or has not—affected his modest family. Narrated in a hybrid of first-person plural and singular, the film gracefully shifts between fiction and nonfiction.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jXHGYmbYNlNfiIwjlOSzkWfZQaE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Pieces","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
