Traveling between contemporary Tunisia (shot in exquisite 16mm black-and-white) and 100 years prior to independence (narrated with ink-etched cutouts), Mohammadia re-envisages official colonial history. The film recounts, in the style of a folk tale, how Bey Ahmed I became smitten with Versailles after a trip to Paris and decided to build an equally sumptuous palace for himself in Tunis, driving his country to ruin in the bargain.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mohammadia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
