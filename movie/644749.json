The Barge Canal was designed to shorten the oil-shipping route from Texas to New Jersey by cutting across the top of Florida, linking the Atlantic with the Pacific. The Oklawaha River, one of Florida’s last remaining wild rivers, was slated as primary water feed-source for the Canal. As a cinema verité depiction of a grass roots attempt to save the river from destruction, Progress, Pork-Barrel, and Pheasant Feathers is a story of profit pitted against beauty, made several years before the word “environment” was even in the political activist lexicon.\" - Holly Fisher","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3hEZ5BfjXuiPuxLdHxTpPdPWhhu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1966-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Progress, Pork-Barrel, and Pheasant Feathers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
