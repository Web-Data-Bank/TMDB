Former boxer Park Si-heon feels like he has already experienced both deaths: first, when he won the most controversial gold medal of the 1988 Olympics and second, when his career ended in disgrace because of that very gold medal. Now on his third life as a hardheaded small town teacher, he is badgered by the principal to coach the school's boxing team. While reluctant at first, Park becomes determined to get the team into shape upon meeting Yeon-woo, a potential boxing star. Together, Park and his underdog team set out to prove that they both have what it takes to be a true champion.","popularity":2.184,"poster_path":"/5ocxY03K0BbmjPHIurEKo7iwYmL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112927,"logo_path":null,"name":"filmK","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":97992,"logo_path":null,"name":"26 Company","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2023-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Countdown","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":4}
