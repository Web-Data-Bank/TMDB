But the filmmaker does not limit his remarks to a pure technical description, he does not forget the man nor his family and village environment, nor the history where his life was written at a given moment.  The director films Marcel Laforge, a blacksmith living in a small village in the Charentes, Garrat.  Shot in one week, the film is a reconstruction; everything has been staged from fragments of multiple realities. This short film is articulated around three themes, sometimes confronted, but often confused: the man, the history and the trade.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gIKfAnTDrHiwFZdNtgldDVcylku.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Farrier","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
