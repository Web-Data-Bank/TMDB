He's down to the last one for the night, thankfully, although once he starts reading it, time seems to slow down. The essay is about a girl, Betty, owning the fact that she's an 18-year old virgin. She's proud, recognizing that her virginity is a special gift -- she doesn't want to give it away to just anyone... Mr. Davies fixates on the student, hearing her utter, \"I'm a virgin,\" in his head over and over again, slowly driving him mad with lust. It's like she's calling to him to be that special someone to make her complete.","popularity":1.195,"poster_path":"/5bYrDyQC9VX1PI8F3EADxVYmvHk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97187,"logo_path":"/8b3EX6zgcWIBhlAMJjlaX8j35hS.png","name":"Pure Taboo","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2019-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Biography of a Virgin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
