Typically for Johann, the work is a beautifully atmospheric composition, one that immerses the listener into the strange recordings of the ‘Numbers Stations’: a category of shortwave radio station broadcasts characterized by readings of number lists, letters and coded messages from a forgotten era. It is to these lost, lonely voices that Johan has turned, capturing the enigmatic transmission of encoded information to persons elsewhere, and reflecting them back within a new context.  In response, Studio AKA director Gergely Wootsch has created a considered and thoughtful animated film, which crosses literal boundaries and thresholds as it drifts along a desolate cold war landscape, following the haunting voice as it searches for a listener.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rhmKJFC0m0b0TEg91CySFu7Muan.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12805,"logo_path":"/kdC2cFkIfh1BPoKBLb99liMrNkN.png","name":"Studio AKA","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2016-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Song For Europa","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
