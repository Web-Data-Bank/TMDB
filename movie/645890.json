At times the form is “stopped” and “started” using the pause of a reel-to-reel video player—a frozen line of noise (an asynchronous frame) cuts through the image reinforcing the sense of physicality. The sounding form is eventually set in an electronically generated landscape with temple-like forms of undulating feedback. Further processing of the voice and additional rhythmic electronic sounds are suggestive of ritual.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cf7n17sb00SNE5oAbmgphdbKtoL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Earth Pulse","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
