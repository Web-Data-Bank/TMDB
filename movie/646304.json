It was filmed 4-6 April 1990 in the beautiful Baroque Basilica of Waldsassen in Bavaria: a few kilometers from the Czech border. It was filmed just a few months after the Iron Curtain had fallen, a mere 6 months before Bernstein's death on 14 October 1990. His painful, labored breathing is evident during this performance. It is a sad reminder of what is to come and it makes this performance, so other-worldly in many ways, particularly poignant. Bernstein conducts the splendid Chor und Symphonieorchester des Bayerischen Rundfunks.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/17vSGpCaAr16SVoYqQ4FBlmgn0Z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10707,"logo_path":"/cxWvdB6JoV1YVNno4VCg3yceoXG.png","name":"Deutsche Grammophon","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2006-06-03","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latin","iso_639_1":"la","name":"Latin"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mozart Great Mass in C Minor; Ave Verum Corpus; Exsultate Jubilate","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
