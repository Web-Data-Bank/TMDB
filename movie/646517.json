To take the pulse of the country, the filmmaker adopts one of documentary cinema’s most prolific sub-genres: the train film. Filmed entirely in the old, run-down, overcrowded passenger trains used by ordinary Ukrainians, the film captures conversations, observes the landscape, and accompanies several protagonists on their journey; they open our eyes to popular preoccupations in a country that seems perpetually anchored in its highly visible Soviet legacy. A fine lesson in listening and humanity.","popularity":0.64,"poster_path":"/8Xp29QHW75YcZO3bZEQSJuay06h.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2019-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don't Worry, the Doors Will Open","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
