Grainy blue tinted images of a swaying branch of silver balls rhythmically knocking each other, mesmerise and evoke a sense of our own physical desire and fear. A hypnotic voice-over of a woman's account of a violent moment with her lover conveys a sense of the continual but unattainable desire to reconcile fantasy with external reality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5rNqhTdu1zMB9RVLsAv5Lz7slXw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One and the Other Time","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
