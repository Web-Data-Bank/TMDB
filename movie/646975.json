No gift is left unscathed or food left untasted. In fact, the so-called credits to the scenic pay cheeky tribute to all that was sacrificed to the puppies’ choppers.  Embedded in the video are references to numerous TV shows such as “Game of Thrones,” “30 Rock,” “Twin Peaks,” “The Good Place,” “Parks and Rec” and more. While some Easter eggs are obvious, eagle-eyed viewers will be rewarded with some far more obscure references. It’s the Christmas gift that keeps on giving.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ryZOeXUHH2buqpd3Y40RRsJZEsz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"“Puppies Crash Christmas” features multiple pups tearing apart a beautiful home decorated for Christmas.","title":"Streaming Wonderland: Puppies Crash Christmas","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
