Although this is undeniably the case, at the same time Under the cold stars can hardly be considered a documentary: the microcosm on which it focuses appears to be a reflection of a broader reality and perhaps a way to deal with the themes of man’s existence and his relationship with animals, nature and, most importantly, with time. As written by Franco Piavoli “it is a film which essentially relies on images and sound, where words themselves are sound and the music of life, of the relentless flow of time”.","popularity":0.668,"poster_path":"/am5u37dXMUWB81dpoJIP0ViAp0W.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2020-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Under the Cold Stars","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":2}
