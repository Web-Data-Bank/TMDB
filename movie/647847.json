This meteorite fragment, the largest ever found hit Namibia 80 000 years ago and more recently a major impact occurred in Toungouska, Russia in 1908. Every year 10 000 tons of meteoritic matter fall onto Earth in much smaller but not necessarily less influential pieces. This film will explore how the impact of these meteorites big and small through the ages have changed our world and what they brought from outer space with them that may have been the seed of life itself on Earth.","popularity":0.841,"poster_path":"/feaCMP3u3uSlPUh6bSFcTsCLnxd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"214 million years ago a gigantic meteorite broke up and impacted Earth","title":"Cosmic Fireballs","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
