You will be amazed as we look into admissions by pre-tribulation leaders who admit that the theory is without clear biblical and historical merit. Join us as we discover the origins of this relatively new doctrine, explore its possible origins among mystics, Jesuits and theologians, and how this doctrine was ultimately disseminated throughout the church. You will be surprised by our stunning conclusion.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/37CaJrS20vsuAilYRvFG8GMDXFg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-08-05","revenue":0,"runtime":264,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Left Behind or Led Astray?: Examining the Origins of the Secret Pre-Tribulation Rapture","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
