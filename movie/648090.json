He exploded into the auto-racing scene by beating all the top-tier drivers of the era and winning the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1959. All while still wearing his chicken-overalls.  Carroll had a heart condition that nearly killed him, forcing him to retire from racing. He started Shelby American and assembled a rag-tag team of hot-rodders to execute his vision of building groundbreaking sports cars like the Shelby Cobra. He also led Ford and the GT40 to multiple victories at Le Mans over Ferrari.  Shelbyâ€™s cars, driven by the greatest drivers in the history of racing, cemented his legacy. He is the only man in history to win Le Mans as both a driver and a manufacturer. And is still the only American auto-manufacturer to win the World Manufacturing Championship.","popularity":1.464,"poster_path":"/A356gy2SPPuNpCOmLj2rIZ9ApvO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":86538,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chassy Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":119,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Carroll Shelby Story","title":"Shelby American","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":7}
