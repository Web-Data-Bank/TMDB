Boys are educated in a specific way, with very different life goals, and toys reflect this discrimination: kitchens, dolls, hairdryers, cosmetic equipment, the whole domestic world for girls. Creative games, those that awaken the imagination (trains, cars, building games, men in space), are intended for boys.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yhEfehVGuekBsIDXEVMCVKbBo7S.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":144331,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tamames-Zemborain","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"1978-08-21","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Toys","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
