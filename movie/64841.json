The concert footage is from Stone's sold-out show at New York City's Irving Plaza, a venue known for its intimacy and for hosting the best alternative and cutting-edge acts on the contemporary music scene. The youthful Stone is known for her unique renditions of soul and R&B classics, but has also emerged as a skillful songwriter. She has collaborated on songs with other artists as diverse as Betty Wright, Portishead's Beth Gibbons, and the Roots. The MIND, BODY & SOUL SESSIONS contains performances by Stone of hits from both of her multi-platinum albums, including her singles \"You Had Me,\" \"Super Duper Love,\" and \"Fell in Love With a Boy,\" a re-working of a song by fellow hipsters the White Stripes. The MIND, BODY & SOUL SESSIONS allows fans to get close to Stone at her best, in a soulful live performance in a special setting.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2XcIxYMo0kGOUuKMvQeQ7SQn5Tm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Live in New York City","title":"Joss Stone - Mind, Body & Soul Sessions","video":false,"vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":2}
