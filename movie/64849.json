Joe and his two best friends, Kevin and Mickey, are struggling to get ahead, dissatisfied with their lives and current financial situation. When a package of ecstasy ends up in their possession at a nightclub, they are enticed by the prospect of scoring some fast cash. The three friends offer to distribute the drugs to their social, business and party contacts for a notorious neighborhood drug lord. Naive and encouraged by their initial success, the boys increase their distribution and quickly find themselves in over their heads with no way to turn back. As addictions take hold and their friendship begins to unravel, they find the lifestyle they have chosen may come at a very high price -- their lives.","popularity":0.612,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-06-01","revenue":590000,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Drugs, sex, and the allure of fast money blur the boundaries between two very different sides of society.","title":"Push","video":false,"vote_average":4.1,"vote_count":7}
