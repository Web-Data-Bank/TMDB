All very personal, and it goes on and on, perhaps of very little meaning to others, but of crucial importance to myself, a record not for Entertainment or Public Exhibition, but something to share with friends, one long evening. Maybe there is a letter to my friends about a very crucial journey back to Ithaca – and a present for Sebastian, something that he’ll rediscover when he’ll be approaching the age when I, Odysseus, began my own travels – this may serve him as a beginner’s map – the Fates will give him better ones.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/58p51DKrfFxakHFkmkf2S2QTofa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":228,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Education of Sebastian or Egypt Regained","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
