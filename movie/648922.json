Whittle’s film seeks to challenge conditions of racialised abjection and find new methods for refusal. A chief linkage is the sonic cosmologies found in Kamau Brathwaite’s research on ‘tidalectics’, and Christina Sharpe’s work on The Weather. Sharpe positions The Weather as a lens to understand the inescapable conditions within the afterlife of slavery, while Brathwaite’s theories of ‘tidalectics’ expose the performativity of sound, revealing memories of transoceanic life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rFwm1SHvefR7BXICdJITiWv0OBd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"between a whisper and a cry","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
