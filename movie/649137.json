In 1971, journalist Linda Lipnack Kuehl set out to write the definitive biography of Billie Holiday. Before her mysterious death in 1978, Lipnack Kuehl had taped over 200 hours of interviews. The tapes have never been heard. Now they form the basis of an atmospheric, multi-layered documentary that captures the many complex facets of a proud black woman, violent drug addict, loyal friend, vindictive lover and unforgettable singer of ‘God Bless The Child’, ‘Saddest Tale’ and the haunting ‘Strange Fruit’.","popularity":2.07,"poster_path":"/ypIq3W5OQjZjBGJQk9l4cHjR6Lu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19638,"logo_path":"/6R3XtbihMWuDRFnlm4MkpxhmEKf.png","name":"Altitude Film Entertainment","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"She sang the truth, she paid the price","title":"Billie","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":16}
