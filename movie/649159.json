In order to help Seongman get over his depression, Areum suggests that they start running “Oegil Restaurant”, a project to cook and serve to a limited number of guests on specific days. However, after the birth of their baby, Areum starts concentrating on her studies and film-making, leaving Seongman parenting alone.
