They are touring Crowd, Gisèle Vienne's dance piece on the 90s rave scene. Following them from theatre to theatre, the film documents their work as well as their strange, intimate relationships. As the line becomes blurry, the stage seems to contaminate real life – unless the opposite is happening. Little by little dance grows into a troubling journey into our nights, our parties, our loves.","popularity":1.095,"poster_path":"/g26t6GpxcETe9b3gVxicPQA8KYX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7059,"logo_path":"/xVFZ1RvZNvAMe7vGH8369fNW0bP.png","name":"Aurora Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":10901,"logo_path":"/8dNHWgUlJNz9HHLtcdsz04jRtyi.png","name":"Ministère de la culture","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":310,"logo_path":"/4Gp5A4YdjPBfsHT47ngHMaXWmb9.png","name":"CNC","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":150703,"logo_path":null,"name":"Image/Mouvement du Centre National des Arts Plastiques","origin_country":""},{"id":11246,"logo_path":"/4YZ5CQZkJa2FIKGtjLLoKhNOAIw.png","name":"La Région Île-de-France","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2020-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"If It Were Love","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":8}
