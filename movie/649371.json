The soundtrack is also acceptable, which may have been quite a task to achieve, given the Basilica's over-reverberant acoustics. Alas, the performance itself does not rise to the occasion. Despite the occasional minor insecurity in ensemble and a visible lack of joy, the Symphonica Toscanini musicians play well, the Coro del Maggio Musicale Fiorentino members sing equally well, and the soloists are more than adequate, almost tangibly trying to excel.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/trEtYyUXgpKT9l33iKAfGFyjPtE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2255,"logo_path":null,"name":"EuroArts Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Verdi Requiem","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
