They're also con artists. Not incredibly successful ones, but they get by. Ed's the leader. Richard's a bit slow. Their old pal Henry, who used to work with them, gave up the con life to work as a security guard at a bank in rural Yorktown. Ed convinces Henry to get back in the game and help them pull their biggest con yet. Of course, they'll have to wade their way through Yorktown's quirky cast of characters to get what they want, which, as is often the case, seems to be ever-changing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/moKp2prNd9NHLg8o7tan4VYW0Pa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125504,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nonfiction the Movie, LLC","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Kings of Yorktown","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
