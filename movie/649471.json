The unusual band of men were lovers, and they joined to regain what they had lost. They were brave, loyal, dedicated, and fought to protect their own. Muscular, blond-haired, Erastes (William Seed) was the dominating top among the group of men, and he chose chiseled, good-looking Eromenos (JJ Knight) to stand by his side in battle, and bed. Together they were unstoppable, and together they made sparks fly every time they would join bodies.","popularity":4.475,"poster_path":"/9oW2TdnIuKv5Mg1wXplCTzgJnVE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53581,"logo_path":"/4DB5CFKeeoKMBN9KiZtqFKAq8FE.png","name":"MEN","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sacred Band Of Thebes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
