The viewer will be led through the broad spectrum of exceptional building culture in Lower Austria, a culture which provides art, theater and music with the plentiful and spectacular stages it deserves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":7180,"logo_path":null,"name":"RIHA Filmproduktions GmbH","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2010-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Architectural Jewels of Lower Austria","title":"Buildings for the Arts","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
