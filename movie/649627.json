These decades included the Great Depression, the peak of labor militancy in 1937 (probably the closest the US has come to a popular revolution since 1787), the rise of the “guest worker” phenomenon, the counter-attack against labor unions, the creation of the military industrial complex, the rise of the FBI, the foundations of the civil rights movement, and the purging of radicals from organized labor and public life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rG399uZwkQMDnyn7o5JRqWB9ShQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7075,"logo_path":null,"name":"Metanoia Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Plutocracy V: Subterranean Fire","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
