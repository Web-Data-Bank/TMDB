It neatly exemplifies the capacity of Europe to ‘talk back’ to the USA within the framework of cultural aid programmes. And as such it can introduce a little‐explored topic: the politics of the avant‐garde in Greece in the post‐Civil War years and in particular the role of US cultural aid. This post‐war perspective throws light on the better‐known National School associated above all with Manolis Kalomiris, who dominated Greek music and musical life in the interwar period. The second part of this paper scrutinises the agenda and achievements of the Kalomiris circle, and that in turn enables useful generalisations about romantic nationalism in music. The third part of the paper reflects on the pre‐World War I achievements of Heptanesian traditions, again caught between singularities and dependencies.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1951-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Story Of Koula","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
