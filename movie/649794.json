The dictatorial government left no stone unturned in using propaganda to convince the people of their mission. Consisting almost entirely of excerpts from the TV program 60 minutes, 1982 summarizes the media campaign that took place over the 74 days of war, when Argentine troops tried to take their island back from the British. We watch TV anchormen ask viewers to donate money for weapons, inspire them to sing the national anthem at home, and welcome government leaders as heroes as they “spontaneously” show up at the studio to celebrate the importance of the mission for the motherland.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dCy5TFgcF2WtIYAv6jsVc0xbis1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2019-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"1982","video":false,"vote_average":8.2,"vote_count":13}
