Andersen, with new magical heroes, terrifying “woodpunk” robot dogs, real puppet theater, songs & dance numbers. Little Hans, a kind itinerant storyteller, opens his magic box, takes out his puppets, and, together with his spectators, creates a new fairytale. But not every character obeys the puppet master’s strings. The truth of the fairytale breaks everyday rules: here loyalty and friendship make miracles; love destroys the strongest magic spells; and a song wins a war!","popularity":0.63,"poster_path":"/klrzALJhm0IJS0fdsDEtCDK4FB3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":101921,"logo_path":"/3gaA5VKUgXqE2NbfM4R0ZgCUcCg.png","name":"Kamer-Ton-Film-Russia","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Tinderbox Against the Magic Well","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":1}
