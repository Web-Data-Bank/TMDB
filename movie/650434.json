[Woman, You Are Beauty!] was a silent film made in Rosario, Argentina. Premiered on 24 March 1928 in one of the city's most important opera houses, with a live orchestra and a model posing on stage, it became a box-office success. (The same would happen in Buenos Aires, where the film was shown a few months later).  Its creator, the Italian-born Argentine Camilo Zaccaría Soprani, was a well-known entertainment journalist in the city. But he would only acknowledge his authorship in an interview forty years later.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dPoZEfp7iupB3BPWMSvFPHB76d0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"1928-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"¡Mujer, tú eres la belleza!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
