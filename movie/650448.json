Conceptually speculating from sixteen years in the future (and a protracted civil war), the project is partly nostalgic political travelogue, partly a quest to mine the archive for what went wrong, and part prewar surveillance records, the project deconstructs and builds to a clashing ideology, culminating in an installation of sound sculpture, four-walled video and artifacts.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nRvxDpLDh40RqaEpmhMikj8PhxF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":138187,"logo_path":null,"name":"Corporation of Yaddo","origin_country":""},{"id":138188,"logo_path":null,"name":"MacDowell Colony","origin_country":""},{"id":138189,"logo_path":null,"name":"iPark Foundation","origin_country":""},{"id":138190,"logo_path":null,"name":"SPACE Gallery","origin_country":""},{"id":138191,"logo_path":null,"name":"Purchase College Foundation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"CIVIL WAR SURVEILLANCE POEMS (Part 1)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
