In Allegory, Friedl vom Gröller stands in the foreground of the scene, anxiously looking into the camera. A circle of women behind her gradually lends the film movement, as their initial earnestness gives way and they traverse the film frame, cheerfully talking. Allegory contrasts Gröller´s melancholy with the cheerfulness of her students.
