I try to select some perhaps archetypal situations and things and present them as part of, and/or in relationship to physical interiors and exteriors and to abstract images in such a way that they all merge into complex 'inscape' that treats on man's bonding to his environment â€” with the very nature of the formal structure lifting the whole business out of time. The key to locking up the whole shebang comes individually to the viewer when he contemplates his own idea of Summer. If the film reminded people of, among other things, man's power to live both past and future in a moment, I'd feel that that was a great deal of what it was about.\" -A.
