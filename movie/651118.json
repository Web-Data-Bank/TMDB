Kosher Sex is Hosted by Boteach, a frequent guest on nationally syndicated talk shows such as Oprah and Larry King Live, host of TLC's \"Shalom in the Home\" and author of numerous bestselling books. The DVD explores the important role that sex plays in people's daily lives and examines a multitude of topics that are both highly entertaining and educational. Kosher Sex is a remarkably refreshing approach to sex that draws on ancient Jewish teachings to provide invaluable help for relationships. Shmuley Boteach, an orthodox rabbi, has been successfully counseling individuals and couples - most notably the late Michael Jackson and Jon Gosselin - for years. What is surprising is how many so-called sexual taboos are actually encouraged in Kosher Sex.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/87iNdAzk48d1B7vtRCLI9LuMV4x.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Kosher Sex DVD is based on Rabbi Shmuley Boteach's best-selling book, which has sold over 1,000,000 copies worldwide and has been translated into 27 languages.
