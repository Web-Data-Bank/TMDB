Gladysen leihoa","overview":"At the beginning of the 80s, the antinuclear movement was in full expansion internationally and also in the Basque Country. In addition to the three plants that were about to be built on the coast (Lemoiz, Ea-Ispaster and Deba), a fourth was planned to be built in Arguedas. To protest against this, mobilizations were organized in Tudela. Gladys del Estal Ferreño traveled to Tudela, but did not return. In that peaceful demonstration, she was killed by the gunshot of a Civil Guard. This documentary, following the Gladys incident, tries to make a portrait of a social movement that attracted the majority of Basque society at that time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/h3TFAp2iCxs0fp6LNBjStiKwigq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115347,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tentazioa Produkzioak","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2019-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Basque","iso_639_1":"eu","name":"euskera"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ez, eskerrik asko!
