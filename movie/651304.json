She crossed 11 countries involved in wars, hitchhiking with another Milanese artist, Silvia Moro, both wearing a wedding dress.  This was a performance for peace, trust and hoping to prove that if you rely on others, youâ€™ll receive good things only.  After travelling many roads, the two artists decided to split for a while in Istanbul, planning to meet again in Byblos. Pippa left then, alone, and nobody heard from her again.","popularity":0.869,"poster_path":"/oi28aNQHway4dihfcbL98AIzJTz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125795,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nacne","origin_country":""},{"id":110397,"logo_path":null,"name":"A+E Networks Italy","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":112512,"logo_path":"/wq8znGT8Q3yIK2uzW1L1sjOmvVY.png","name":"Filmoption International","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":125796,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fiumi Film","origin_country":""},{"id":125797,"logo_path":null,"name":"Esplorare la Metropoli","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2020-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I'm in Love with Pippa Bacca","video":false,"vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":6}
