In the films of Shablevičius, the village, the land, the lonely tree standing outside are often filmed in winter, when everything gets the shade of a fairy tale and a miracle, and a rider on the road brings an unexpected message. The old mythical rural worldview seems to come alive in the eyes of the audience.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wqYyFM6H5OadoI3dQbOBNyKUbp3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Leaps to Dance, Loves to Sing","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
