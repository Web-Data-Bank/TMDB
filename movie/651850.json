Next to her is a little sparkle, from how light and joyful she is. But her ex-man - not cool at all, and left a scar for her, ”- this is how the blog of Rina Tsunami, a tattoo artist from Vladimir, begins. She collects stories of women who come to her studio to hide traces of burns, cuts, gunshot wounds. Covering scars, Rina helps women forget about violence and start life anew. Meanwhile, in Moscow, Valery Panteeva is organizing the project “Tattoos instead of scars” in conjunction with the studio Maverick. Masters of a tattoo studio, like Rina, cover the scars of victims of domestic violence. But some women do not want them to hide their scars. For Rachel from Newport (UK), the trail of a gunshot wound became part of herself, her pride, a terrible story that she could survive. Rachel wrote a book on violence, collects signatures for petitions to amend English law, and creates relief groups for people like her.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":101778,"logo_path":"/plb9PIPsbNCz9qp8SKG5XJQKAXP.png","name":"SPbGIKiT","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2019-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Metamorphosis","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
