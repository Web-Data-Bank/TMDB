His work and the mounting societal pressures of what is expected of him is a disconnect from his true self. Moreover, his passivity towards life is made apparent through his discourses with friends and family, who voice their perspective of life. Trijya traces the journey of Avdhut and how he faces the reality of his own dreams and aspirations about life in a large Indian city. It takes us through the challenges of today's modern way of life and the compromises one inevitably makes along the way to find peace and a place we can call our own.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dzSVEvxZkChmfovjmG1apCxaPuP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97321,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bombay Berlin Film Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":125898,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chitrakathi Nirmitee","origin_country":""},{"id":125899,"logo_path":null,"name":"Firta Cinema","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2019-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Marathi","iso_639_1":"mr","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trijya - Radius","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
