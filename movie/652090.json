The past season provided massive amounts of snow throughout the world which in turn provided our athletes prime conditions for some insane cliff drops, jumps, and all around deep powder riding. This year's Braaap film continues to bring you talented riders destroying the deep pow and exploring the mountains throughout the world. Join Duncan Lee as he takes you for a ride through some of California's best snow. Check out a bit of Sweden with Johan Forsberg. Take in some views in Alaska with Chris Yelverton and watch some huge drops by Jon Jean, Denver Debes, and Jamie Iwaschuk up in Canada! With a great mixture of sledding action, Braaap 17 #Hashtag will not let you down!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/i0OEfUKfjJCWNtk9asjOBCHagq5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"This year's Braaap film continues to bring you talented riders destroying the deep pow and exploring the mountains throughout the world.","title":"Braaap 17: #Hashtag","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
