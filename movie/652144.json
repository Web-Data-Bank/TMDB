Having made his famous 1966 studio recording of \"Das Lied von der Erde\" in Vienna, Bernstein re-recorded this in Israel with the same searing subjectivity. Ren√© Kollo draws on the voice of a great Wagner tenor, while Christa Ludwig, the greatest exponent of the contralto songs at the time, is unbearably poignant in the final movement's fusion of elation and sadness.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hWOSgpudGmt3yi82Bzv4pQ7fyeq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10707,"logo_path":"/cxWvdB6JoV1YVNno4VCg3yceoXG.png","name":"Deutsche Grammophon","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2005-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":176,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mahler - Symphonies Nos. 9 & 10 / Das Lied von der Erde","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
