This endeavor is the Beacon that propels Louif from trip to trip, spot to spot, trick to trick and shot to shot. Captured with an emphasis on traditional film in locales affording natural speed, Beacon director Hayden Rensch has proven that the style and instincts of a rider left to his own devises can still produce unreal riding and unforgettable imagery despite the absence of modern day accouterments like computers and machines. With Beacon each setting is highlighted by a distinct aesthetic producing a subdued visual narrative.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wn8QIDwpodyX7DiW28PwJO7NFvS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Louif Paradis has emerged as one of the most respected snowboarders of all time.
