Situated in a strange, trashy universe, the story revolves around two creatures. A taxidermist and a butcher. The butcher gets the taxidermist hooked on his drugs, which he offers as an alleged cure for the taxidermist’s disease. The taxidermist becomes a junkie and gives away the most precious love to the butcher in exchange for more drugs. After realizing what he did, he goes to take what belongs to him, but the path ahead is a one-way journey.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/w23PQwGzwh7UKBy0rK6NMIw3H6k.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107523,"logo_path":null,"name":"Univerza v Novi Gorici Akademija Umetnosti","origin_country":"SI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"2019-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Soma","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
