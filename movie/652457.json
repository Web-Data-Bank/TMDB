There wouldn't be anything special about this trip, if the bird that announces death, would not begin to scream in the orchard in front of the Kutos family's house. This causes turmoil among the travelers. Nevertheless, they go to Ukraine and it seems that everything will be fine and that this will be just another nostalgic journey of grandchildren's following the footsteps of their grandfathers. Then, in the middle of the journey towards Zaturci, a message from military museum comes up that Peter Kutos could not fight in Zaturci in 1916, since he was called into the army in 1917, a year later. That changes everything. And this will have to be said to Geza.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8FKLy53ChdU6Wi86CesGEMseLCK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126798,"logo_path":null,"name":"MPN Studio","origin_country":""},{"id":34679,"logo_path":"/cPk44BLr1wgQCRdvtpnMISkitMS.png","name":"Perfo Production","origin_country":"SI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"2019-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Uncle Geza Goes to Zaturci","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
