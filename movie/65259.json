In the US, it was equally successful, topping the Billboard album chart for nine weeks, spending 58 weeks in the Top 40 there and earning a Grammy Award for Album of the Year.  The story of the making of The Joshua Tree is told here, via interview and archive film footage, with contributions from band members Bono, The Edge, Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr. U2â€™s long-time manager Paul McGuinness reveals how the album catapulted the band into the category of rock superstars, and there are contributions from Elvis Costello in the role of a major U2 fan, re-mix producer Steve Lillywhite, and of course co-producers Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois.  Packed with reminiscences and powerful performances, this is the story of one of the most famous and best records of the Eighties, a true Classic Album.","popularity":1.465,"poster_path":"/rnW39WIw3fW8T5Pv9sLhCo0vLFi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8273,"logo_path":"/pXZ6qUs6bZUsS5zsRXrojW9aZ1f.png","name":"Eagle Rock Entertainment","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-02-05","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Classic Albums: U2 - The Joshua Tree","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":8}
