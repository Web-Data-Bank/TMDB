The plight of the oyster, offers a keyhole view of human impact on the environment. Following the oyster from proliferation, to decimation, to resurgence, the story parallels the presence of the Barnegat Baymen and Baywomen working the water for the last four centuries. Through a dynamically fluid visual esthetic, the undercurrent of the film's driving force, an ethos of environmental stewardship flows throughout the film. With 90% of seafood imported in the US, the sustainable seafood movement both local and global is in the hand of the Oyster Farmers. They are bringing the bounty- back from seed to farm to plate.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A feature documentary film centering on oyster aquaculture in the Barnegat Bay","title":"The Oyster Farmers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
