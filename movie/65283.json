His wife Nellie, detached and indifferent, feels little grief and realizes that her coldness is her own doom. Over the next two days, she is attracted to George, a local drunk who does odd jobs for brothels and dances grotesquely for tourists in exchange for drinks. George has his own dark secret, a tragedy he caused that leaves him with a death wish. In assisting the local doctor to cope with the epidemic, these two emotional cripples enable each other to rediscover reasons to live and to love.","popularity":1.457,"poster_path":"/ewUAVg0hCxWVaedGcV6mWY93sJh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1649,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reforma Films","origin_country":""},{"id":11788,"logo_path":null,"name":"Compagnie Industrielle et Commerciale Cinématographique (CICC)","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"1953-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Strips Bare of Prim Morality a Side of Love That Women Won't Admit - Even to Themselves!","title":"The Proud and the Beautiful","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":19}
