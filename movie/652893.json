Inside their pages, diary-like, deported women recount their experiences in Greek concentration camps. Many of them were active in the resistance under Nazi occupation. Actress Olympia Dukakis, who serves as the film’s narrator, was also the individual who originally called director Toska’s attention to the unique documents.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xzZwzKPICvEcPdHpcTHWwR82qBK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The truth lies below","title":"Beneath the Olive Tree","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
