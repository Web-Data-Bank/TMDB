Her wiry legs and featherless back don’t startle Isabel, an ex music teacher who picks her for being so special. Turuleca doesn’t lay eggs because her hidden talent is another: she talks, she sings and she dances, giving it her all. Turu, the Wacky Hen is a full-color, animated party that invites us to move our bodies to its musical numbers, making us sing verses that have the power to turn us into children once again, if only for a little while.","popularity":8.789,"poster_path":"/xaG10x1C8dCHkNumSslH6jwzvpt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10823,"logo_path":null,"name":"Argentina Sono Film","origin_country":"AR"},{"id":126074,"logo_path":null,"name":"Brown Films AIE","origin_country":""},{"id":58393,"logo_path":"/k6FTLja7xIF39fTNMXr2KhxbNot.png","name":"Gloriamundi Producciones","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":126075,"logo_path":null,"name":"In Post We Trust","origin_country":"AR"},{"id":6458,"logo_path":"/eT4oMUK7ODM0vvZue8yq3Ojwqf8.png","name":"INCAA","origin_country":"AR"},{"id":126076,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mediabyte","origin_country":""},{"id":103476,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mogambo Films","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":34259,"logo_path":"/qUcQmkCRJA3jjxqZBlJybWRmTsI.png","name":"Pampa Films","origin_country":"AR"},{"id":126077,"logo_path":null,"name":"Produccions A Fonsagrada","origin_country":""},{"id":23295,"logo_path":"/qhcd72CVp5XobLPpr4J4uDppm5T.png","name":"Tandem Films","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"This chick is clucking awesome!!!","title":"Turu, the Wacky Hen","video":false,"vote_average":7.126,"vote_count":95}
