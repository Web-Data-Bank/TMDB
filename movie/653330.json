Through his lifestory, some of the most important events of the 20th century are explored: from fascism to liberation, from migration towards America to the Soviet invasion of Hungary. The legendary figure of Joe was unjustly tainted for years by betting scandals; but Giuseppe Esposito represents an exemplary figure for the city of Naples: a man of humble origins who fought to build himself a future, succeeding in resisting and fighting against all adversities of an unfortunate destiny.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ar9JwIcbjrdqfxboxyp64ZBJIQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2018-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Bull of Pallonetto","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
