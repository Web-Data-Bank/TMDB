The orchestra then went on the road to perform the unique work in Quebec’s Far North, stopping in Kuujjuaq, Salluit, Kuujjuarapik, Oujé-Bougoumou, Mashteuiatsh and Maliotenam. Far more than just a concert film, Chaakapesh puts the audience front row centre as artists and communities come together in a remarkable cultural space. Poignant testimonials, important discussions and Maestro Nagano as we’ve never seen him before.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xOXDNcF5KXWAxjQvpdL4zKoDp9q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":126,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cree","iso_639_1":"cr","name":""},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Inuktitut","iso_639_1":"iu","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chaakapesh","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
