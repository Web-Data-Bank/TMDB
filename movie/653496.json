A young athlete Yaroslav is not happy in his life: boredom and routine of daily workouts, need of constant self-control, etc. But most of all he is concerned about a strange feeling he has for men. Only his close friend Andrew seems to understand what is happening to him. For Yaroslav it's difficult to admit that he is a gay. Internal problems become external: he fights with a member of the national team and is on the verge of scandalous charges. He is referred to a psychologist who gently opens his eyes to himself.","popularity":0.624,"poster_path":"/q6xJzprxM1CmCjGcM8zy1bI8rfc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Three Times About It","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
