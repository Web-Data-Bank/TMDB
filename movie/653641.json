Characteristically, Cho's images telescope in scale, from rain-droplets on a puddle to endless ocean-swells rolling in from the horizon. His intricate and complex processing is analogous to the motion of the water; the screen fragments into rolling \"waves,\" roils upon itself, and dissolves into layers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6CCFExTJDMiNHkJBqB7YEVBCfqM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cold Pieces","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
