Hundred of bones were stolen and deposited in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington DC, until it became known to Arnhem elders in the late 1990s. The return of the sacred artefacts was called for, resulting in a tense standoff between indigenous tribespeople and the Department of Anthropology at the Smithsonian.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/t7PDq3vd0Wj1KWdeVts1ZG3MG2r.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16577,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ronin Films","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":126198,"logo_path":null,"name":"Red Lily Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2018-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"This is an exceptional piece of filmmaking, governed by qualities of restraint and attunement that are essential to its subject.\"  - Jane Goodall.","title":"Etched in Bone","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
