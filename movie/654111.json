Mrs. Bell uses it as an opportunity to ask her rich sister, Fable, for money. To succeed in her task, she needs the evening to be perfect, so she hires a maid named Arya to help her daughter Eve clean the house during the evening. Everything was fine until her drunk husband brings Fableâ€™s ex-girlfriend, Lola to the party. Unfortunately for Mrs. Bell, Lola will not be her only problem that night because her other sister-in-law, Fabula is mentally unstable and can explode at any moment. It will certainly be a long night at the Bell house this Christmas.","popularity":0.749,"poster_path":"/2papNW7Zc4N5GeEYU3x1LD4WwZx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10294,"logo_path":"/vxbfHCCtnd0uJlmUi5i1NNi40wR.png","name":"Sweetheart Video","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2019-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":122,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Lesbian Christmas Story","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":3}
