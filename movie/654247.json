The operatic experience of the conductor was almost tangible, revealing the sheer dramatic instrumental battle between Bruckners God and the Devil between heaven and hell without betraying Bruckners unerring sense of striking proportions. The release of this contrapuntal masterpiece (as Bruckner, not without pride, referred to this work) is part of Daniel Barenboims Bruckner cycle with the renowned Staatskapelle Berlin.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oyh3aqJOX8sbvKWh5Ddf8JDuKsJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71247,"logo_path":null,"name":"Accentus Music","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2010-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bruckner Symphony No. 5","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
