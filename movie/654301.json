Burroughs Birthday Bash","overview":"To celebrate the 100th birthday of America's most audacious writer, William S. Burroughs, Chicago Humanities Festival brings together a motley crew of poets, writers, and musicians. William Seward Burroughs (1914 - 1997) was an American writer and visual artist. He was a primary figure of the Beat Generation and a major postmodernist author whose influence is considered to have affected a range of popular culture as well as literature. Burroughs's needs took him across the United States, down into Mexico, to Europe and beyond. On his travels, he meets up with various members of the underground drug and \"outcast\" cultures.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oCtc4kV2ri3JX5sBPflVB15K7LE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126247,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chicano Humanities Festival","origin_country":""},{"id":126248,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lake Forest College","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"William S.
