He talks about the struggle of growing up clay, feeling different, getting picked on at school, thinking it was his fault, and drowning his sorrows at a clay bar. His dad, Lance, talks sympathetically about his son. Off camera, \"Mr. X\" looks back at the 1970s, when being clay was cool, but that time has passed. Steve discovers a support group, which helps him to accept that it's okay to be clay.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gFiaEnvk4GibcGEuF1OF2pyiehO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Clay Pride: Being Clay in America","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
