That turned out to be Natal, 1000km away. I was the sole film crew, carrying the camera bag and tripod, loading the film, reading the light and occasionally applying sun screen. The film from that trip is the material on this DVD. And it was beautiful to see that country and those people.” ⁠—Phill Niblock","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/w3vgdHyzHQcXR48GRQsFDDZpwFD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brazil 84","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
