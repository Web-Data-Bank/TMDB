Based on Carles last script completed in 2000, entitled 'Mona MC Gill et son vieux père malade', Charles Binamés documentary, which took slightly over two years to film, gives us a friendly, penetrating look of a brave, lucid creator confronted with suffering and the perspective of death. Although the subject is grave, we see a stong will to live and to create. A movie shrouded in all the light and love of Chloé Ste-Marie, the famous directors companion of 25 years.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bRl3KjYYYlYcXUGADUjMWYH1hoG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98425,"logo_path":null,"name":"Amazone Film","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2005-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gilles Carle ou l'indomptable imaginaire","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
