Mickey, the photographer, leads the group while the three models perform in a session that seems to dilate out of the script and into their lives. As the scene evolves, the wounded artist Viktor will take an impassioned trip through his feelings of doubt, fear and ambition, before climaxing into an erotic burst with the group. A story of will and perceptions that could easily allude to our owns - and to our individual impressions of erotica.","popularity":8.377,"poster_path":"/z9CBnS23j2hKTQEFgKAeqwTL6Cu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":105342,"logo_path":null,"name":"Noel Alejandro Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Under the Rain","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":6}
