The film is structured in three blocks subdivided into corners: - the first \"discovers\" the theme of the earth and its characters, focusing on the proper land problem; - the second analyzes land use by studying the agricultural economy; - and finally, the third presents the violence generated by the concentration studied in the first two. First documentary consisting of a large panel of landscape and Brazilian history, filmed throughout our territory and focusing on the land problem - with serious consequences for the current stage of Brazilian development from the discovery to the present day.
