The great steel industry which feeds on its black gold is shown in full blast.  But the film reaches beyond coal, steel and the activity of a great port into the lives of the people of Newcastle.  It covers not only the mines and the mills but moves into the dwelling and working places and the natural beauty of their surroundings where they find their pleasures.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8sWlC4fu3fMq4WpipawMKRCjZyP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126414,"logo_path":null,"name":"Australian Department of Information","origin_country":""},{"id":47768,"logo_path":null,"name":"Australian Commonwealth Film Unit","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1945-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Story of a City","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
