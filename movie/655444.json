The only daughter and the only grandson - that's the whole family, whose life was largely determined by the deceased. In the process of parsing her husband's things, she discovers a letter from her husband. It contains a secret that the head of the family kept from Elizabeth Petrovna for several decades, the story of his French love and a child born out of wedlock. The woman is trying to tell her daughter Valeria about this, but she has her own problems and interests, \"not up to it.\" What to say about the grandson who lives in a separate, separate reality. It seems that in this family it is simply not customary to listen, let alone hear each other.
