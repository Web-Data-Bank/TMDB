The intention in making the film was to catch people and the relationships between things in as natural a way as possible, and to minimize the apparent intrusion of the filming process into the subject matter. The story is really a collection of vignettes from everyday life: getting a job, eating a meal at home with your parents, chance meetings with strangers, taking a nap. A carefree camaraderie pervades the film.\" â€”Keith Lock & Jim Anderson","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wEdXanbGdk6A4JjuV7t1vGqfRYK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Work Bike & Eat","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
