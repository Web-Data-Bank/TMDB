Julien cannot resist the temptation and takes the jewels with him. He later learned from the press that the man in the car was killed. Maria (Galiena), the boarding lady who accommodates Julien, brings him into contact with a healer. Julien and Maria become lovers, cash in on the loot and flee. It is quite obvious that this does not lead to a happy ending and that the opportunistic amateur thief is confronted with professional criminals. Galiena, in particular, as an Italian hotel keeper, Maria, impresses in a beautiful drama written by Valérie Bonnier, Carlos Perez-Merinero, Luis Maria and Robert Valey.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oNBOtM3AR0DvdPTZ2PRRf2yRq0w.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16026,"logo_path":null,"name":"FIT Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1997-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le coup du sort","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
