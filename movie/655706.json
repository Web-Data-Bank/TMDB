Musically and dramatically, we are introduced to a radically new and different world when the opening bars of Die Walküre resound. A fully developed orchestral palette of Leitmotivs paints a wild storm scene, and the curtain rises on a modest dwelling: a fully human scene that has nothing to do with the gods, dwarves and nymphs of Das Rheingold. At the same time, however, the way Die Walküre portrays radical beginnings reveals some telling reminiscences of the unfolding of Das Rheingold. Die Walküre is exciting and deeply feeling drama.","popularity":0.631,"poster_path":"/rETZttxtLq9UvMrI0LpjddSg9Oc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79568,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arthaus Musik","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":26664,"logo_path":"/tmdslqWvUZVJoSmVD142vpD6845.png","name":"Teatro alla Scala","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":181636,"logo_path":null,"name":"Staatsoper Unter den Linden","origin_country":""},{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/6EFUenZrAK7IBbirooJ4ZLzJpJ5.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2013-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":238,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wagner: Die Walküre","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
