For the last 40 years, renowned whale scientist Ken Balcomb has closely observed them. Heâ€™s familiar with a deadly pattern, as salmon numbers plummet orcas starve.  The orcas need roughly a million salmon a year, where to find a million fish? The solution, says Balcomb, is getting rid of four fish-killing dams 500 miles away on the largest tributary to what once was the largest chinook producing river on earth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gAD8llmmb8AOkDfzzqSemdSJ64V.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dammed to Extinction","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
