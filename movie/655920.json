The only surviving print is a black and white workprint from the color original. Since black-and-white positive film stock was not full-color sensitive, warm colors (like skin tones) print dark, hence the dark complexion of the actors in the film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cqS5UxH45XzyHOoRg26cBURCTj6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19710,"logo_path":"/9sPn1XGgKkLvWTbH1wdqML6AA1h.png","name":"LVN Pictures","origin_country":"PH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"1960-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Festival in Rhythm","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
