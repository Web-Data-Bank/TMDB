This film was shot in my mother's village in Southern Sri Lanka—shortly after the civil war in 2010. Collaboratively developed with members of my family there, a narrative was improvised around an investigation into my mother's interactions with spirits in the community during her childhood. Landing somewhere between horror fiction and “spectral” ethnography, the film describes a population reeling from devastations of the past, where distinctions between the living and the dead are thinning, and foreign influences loom over Sri Lanka’s commercial, economic, and media infrastructure.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p8y6GgwWdHGrf5KJrdpdVW4a41z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131815,"logo_path":null,"name":"Envy the Monster","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LK","name":"Sri Lanka"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Eyes of Summer","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
