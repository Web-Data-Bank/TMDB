Virtually abstract imagery shot from a basement looking upwards via a pavement level window towards the side of Southwark Cathedral through dayglo ribbons which were part of some roadworks. A consequence of absorbing Peter Gidalâ€™s theory of Structural Materialist film which I first encountered in 1975 in the issue of Studio International devoted to Avant-Garde Film. It was suggested that I should make more films like this, but it was unrepeatable for reasons hard to define. Apart from the technological issues, the film is very specific to a particular time and place. Passages was something of a sequel.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8GPnP8sWF1CcGfa7peKcmPCJBE6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Untitled 1985","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
