Since then, this once-wealthy country has gone through five presidents and watched its currency fall by more than 70 percent. How do people survive in a broken economy? The solutions range from the ingenious -- barter clubs where members can exchange goods and services without money -- to the brutal, including outbreaks of rioting. With the most basic government services now only a memory and the army camped around the capital, how can the people of Argentina begin to put their society back together? What does a financial meltdown look like? And where do American interests or responsibilities lie?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cry For Argentina","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
