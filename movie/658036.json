Meanwhile, a professional hockey star moves into the neighborhood, offering his services as a goalkeeper--leading two rival teams of Prague schoolboys, The Little Lions and The Devil Street Boys, to fall over themselves in order to gain his favor. The goalie's son, basking in his father's glory, is asked to replace a member of the Lions team, prompting the usual boyish rivalries and battles. Some of the Lions players are so preoccupied with the impending \"big game\" that their schoolwork suffers, to the chagrin of their teachers and parents.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oMer4glAtk0eVuYGbdbLiCpb5dG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1931,"logo_path":"/5erHhgvym2cTORao8ajtn2gbiTH.png","name":"Filmové studio Barrandov","origin_country":"XC"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","name":"Czechoslovakia"}],"release_date":"1957-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"},{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Goalkeeper Lives On Our Street","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
