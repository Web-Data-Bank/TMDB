The show is an archaic study of passion, a sacrifice of bodies that do not deny their fluids: sweat, saliva, blood. With a dramaturgy organized in paintings, Wolf can be considered a moving painting. Performers form a chorus of crowd into extreme existence, in an unbridled sequence of actions / images: they run, fall to the ground, have sex with each other and recite Emily Dickinson's poems. The montage circulates in several languages, articulating text, dance, performance and theater.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tkGgHFQiv2hPQPzX2vydNwLdDYU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-03-14","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wolf","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
