The Switzerland-set melodrama takes place in a resort and chronicles the reaction of patrons when an interracial couple shows up for a stay. Some critics claim that careful, sensitive viewers may be able to pick out gay subtext running throughout the story.","popularity":0.944,"poster_path":"/1cZCuDAJgCx8bXL9CHMSB2r4Rlb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":67576,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pool Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1930-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Borderline","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":17}
