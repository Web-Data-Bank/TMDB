Terry Ghusto is the returning émigré moving in with his brother-in-law, newly unemployed road-sweeper Bobby Channels, while attempting to make a name for himself in local politics. The film follows the varying fortunes of the two, as Terry's high-flying pretensions come into sharp conflict with Bobby's own more humble voyage of self-discovery.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"},{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Irish","iso_639_1":"ga","name":"Gaeilge"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A film exercising our non-existent democratic freedom","title":"Shamrocracy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
