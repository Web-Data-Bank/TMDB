This was the time when Saint Soldiers pledged their lives for the protection of all the subjugated communities around them. Dastan-e-Miri Piri is a retelling of this glorious era of the Sixth Sikh Guru Shri Guru Hargobind with the unwavering and loyal assistance of Baba Bidhichand, and takes us back to the time when the concept of Miri-Piri first came into being. The 17th century also marked the construction of the Sikh fort \"Akaal Tukht\" in Amritsar, the first war fought and won by Sikhs, and many other proud accomplishments.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/AqOyfixtQOzLCsjSVsQoLqEAmMb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":180720,"logo_path":null,"name":"Brumha Studios","origin_country":""},{"id":159299,"logo_path":null,"name":"White Hill Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2019-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Punjabi","iso_639_1":"pa","name":"ਪੰਜਾਬੀ"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dastaan-E-Miri Piri","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
