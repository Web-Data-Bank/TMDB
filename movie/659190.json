The backdrop of the film is Kisiel's hitherto hidden archive, consisting of dozens of color slides, documenting photo shoots organized by Kisiel and his friends in a private apartment. The photos taken in 1985 and 1986 may be considered a direct reaction to the Polish anti-gay militia campaign ('Hiacynt'), during which the Secret Police collected information about homosexuals in Poland using them later for blackmail.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/47wGGJpeXDmXHSs81EciptAuij8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kisieland","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
