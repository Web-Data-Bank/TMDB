To fill this void in their lives, he feeds and clothes abandoned children, raising them in his mansion as if they were his own. As would never be the case in real life today, in this fantasized story set in 1925, no one objects to this behavior, and they live pleasantly and enjoyably together. Things grow considerably more animated when a stage magician places his very attractive daughter in the colonel's household, which stirs a lively romantic interest from his boys and from the great man himself.","popularity":1.403,"poster_path":"/eNTGAi14b8Dl5abdHV8DbIqr0Fl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16132,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lotus Films","origin_country":""},{"id":43711,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dean Film","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":45002,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gica","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1991-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Children Thief","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":8}
