Conflict over the land emerges and escalates between the villagers and representatives of the conglomerate. The villagers have come to view the situation as more of a matter of morality than of land ownership after finding out that a bar and billiards center will be built there. The head of the village’s Islamic boarding school, H. Murad, who is assisted by H. Rhoma, attempts to influence the villagers to refuse to sell their land. Eventually, the charismatic religious leader KH Zainuddin MZ succeeds in mediating the conflict, and even influences the conglomerate owner, Bustomi (WD. Mochtar), to rethink his plans. The land conflict theme of this film is interesting in that it reflects the social issues arising out of the rapid pace of development of the time.  This may be Rhoma Irama’s best film, even though it was not very popular.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xY14AGxRANeYWCMosMrAqlyzTRE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":92244,"logo_path":null,"name":"PT Bola Dunia Film","origin_country":"ID"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nada dan Dakwah","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
