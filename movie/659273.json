If you are lucky you are hit by its rays for a short while during a lifetime, but the light is transient. Artists Karin \"Mamma\" Andersson and Jockum Nordstr√∂m bathing in the light of fame. Few other artist couples in Sweden can compete with them in terms of attention and success. They exhibit at all the major galleries and fairs around the world, win prizes and are constantly in demand.
