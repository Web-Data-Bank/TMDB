Spoofing on the horror genre, Zebub pokes fun at the clich√©s of slasher flicks, replacing fear with humor. Also featured are works from directors Isabelle Stephen and Shane Morton and a short film about a schizophrenic who finds that the voices in his head are coming from the television.","popularity":0.621,"poster_path":"/znK8owFVxLcC7e7QrxCEItJa5IJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Skits-O-Phrenia","video":true,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
