Filmed across six countries between Europe and Africa, with a proxy-archival quality, it follows Rokâ€™s account of his struggles as an exiled freedom fighter of the post-colonial, apartheid era. In conversation with his daughter, he tells of his numerous deportations, prison sentences, and academic career. As Rok recounts the collapse of the apartheid regime, Breakfast in Kisumu shows us a homecoming: his journey back to Africa for the transition of the African National Congress (ANC) from a liberation movement into a governing party, his marriage into the Sisulu Family, and the continental significance of 1994.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A6c0txBqFyFqWOT63ClLSC809vh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127215,"logo_path":null,"name":"Coretta Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KE","name":"Kenya"},{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Breakfast in Kisumu","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
