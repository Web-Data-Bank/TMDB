She also tells the story of a flour mill in Gaza bombed by the Israeli military. Over the years, Rhodes has shifted from abstraction to near-documentary as her anger at governments becomes palpable. Her work is all the more compelling because her eloquence with film matches her political convictions.’ – Ben Luke","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yHUpTKRiSJJofMvpPanoeSDKXa0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dissonance and Disturbance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
