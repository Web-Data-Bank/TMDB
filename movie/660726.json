On a bucolic, tree-lined stage designed by Es Devlin, and accompanied only by her brother FINNEAS (co-winner of the Songwriter of the Year Award) on piano and guitar, she reimagined songs from throughout her meteoric career. The stark arrangments and intimate venue only highlighted her charisma and power. While \"bad guy\" and \"bury a friend\" may have been everywhere in 2019, they feel new and revelatory hereâ€”the perfect showcase for an artist who defined the year but clearly won't be held down by that definition.","popularity":0.743,"poster_path":"/lPOXX6Zn8OSGOW3DH87w6qqJJNb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14801,"logo_path":"/bnlD5KJ5oSzBYbEpDkwi6w8SoBO.png","name":"Apple","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Billie Eilish - Live at the Steve Jobs Theater","video":true,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
