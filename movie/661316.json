The film deals with the terrain of the American West, McCarthyesque characters and the mystery that is your heart's desire. Join these three pilgrims as they enter the world of McCarthy, and encounter characters that seem sprung from the pages of Blood Meridian, Child of God, Suttree and other dark classics.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7wrwMPpENtSPhlA7sL3Yf59m7BX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127398,"logo_path":null,"name":"Imagenation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Looking for Cormac","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
