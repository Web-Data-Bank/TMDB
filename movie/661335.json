Her childhood ended when she was sexually abused for the first time at the age of 11. Even though she has a strong personality and speaks five languages fluently, she was never able to take care of herself. In the 1990s, she became one of the IT Girls of the post-reunification party scene in Berlin. She only feels safe among gay men. Decades of drug-abuse may have destroyed her brain, but not her personality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zRZTlsXpBQhhYJUcaQowPMx6VLK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2020-01-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Character One: Susan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
