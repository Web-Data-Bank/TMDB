Fifty years later it is still there, stuck in the memory of at least two generations, with the music of the theme song, the famous curtains and above all the phrase floats in our memories: \"to bed after Carosello\". We wanted to remember it with a trip among the most beautiful \"advertisements\", as they called them, commented with joy, nostalgia and a bit of irony by the protagonists of yesterday and today: Sandra Mondaini and Raimondo Vianello, Arbore and Boncompagni, Lelio Luttazzi and Ric and Gian, but also Marco Giusti and many others. Carosello lived for twenty years and was the most loved by Italians of all ages. On the day of farewell, in 1977, there were 19 million.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pFZ7AAbd6tFwfk6fC2G9gvtr2M8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"50 years of Carosello","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
