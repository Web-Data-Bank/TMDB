Ignoring instructions to 'play down the gay angle', he centres the film on his own very candid conversations with two HIV+ young men. Sadly the identities of the interviewees have to be concealed, and so the freewheeling camerawork focuses most often on Tsai himself; but the sense of rapport between the director and his 'new friends' is palpable and very moving, even to Western viewers already only too familiar with these issues.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4oRkofnllkyID3OCjvbKW06MdCb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My New Friends","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
