Local girl, Mary Malloy (Tara O'Neil) decides that since she has probably slept with every man in town Eamonn should be next on her list. He proves to be quite a catch... and Mary gets pregnant even though she took precautions. A doctor discovers that Eamonn has a very high sperm count and, with the birth rate in Ireland decreasing, Millicent (Bronagh Gallagher) decides to hire out Eamonn to women whose husbands have been firing blanks; all with the blessing of the local Catholic church which sees it as morally better than artificial means.","popularity":1.813,"poster_path":"/9rETAsUfz4CX9BpIVxVfdlMv9Vr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2000-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The most fertile man in Ireland is in serious demand","title":"The Most Fertile Man in Ireland","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":7}
