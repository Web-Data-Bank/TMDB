Anyone who came to the valley was considered protected and safe from the law. The proclamation also stated that they should have a chance at repentance. The Master of Eva Palace, who is now master of the martial arts world, holds no regard for the ancient laws and enters the valley in search of the 10 Untouchable Villians because she has a warrant of justice to destroy them. The remaining 8 villians were actually the 10 Untouchable Heroes until they were framed by two of their own members, The Twin Villians, and used as scapegoats.","popularity":2.703,"poster_path":"/9m9W2IDpaOxSGLotWc1on39srqZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3619,"logo_path":null,"name":"Win's Movie Productions","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1992-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Handsome Siblings","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":9}
