She speaks about what she sees when flipping through different channels on TV, and what she reads when browsing through a magazine. She blends these distracted descriptions of media with thoughts on a past romantic experience and the possibility of a relationship with a new acquaintance. On screen, we see shots of a TV set surrounded by a dark room. The channel is frequently switched; the images on screen sometimes complement the woman's story and sometimes expand it in unexpected directions. Shots of a young man (played by the artist) turning towards the camera and pointing a gun towards the viewer are interspersed with the collage of TV clips.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sensible Shoes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
