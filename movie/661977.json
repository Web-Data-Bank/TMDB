Because none of them wants to rob people of their own race, it sets them off to a series of arguments over self-identity. This leads the would-be bandits to continually divide the passengers into various ethnic, cultural and economic subgroups in an effort to find a class of people that none of them identify with - a group they can feel good about robbing. When the train arrives at the next station, no one expects that the situation would be reversed. Self-identity is truly a bitch.","popularity":0.607,"poster_path":"/gJBT7HgJDWkzGXsTqymnompvMGE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127491,"logo_path":null,"name":"Taylor Cut Films","origin_country":""},{"id":127492,"logo_path":null,"name":"Double Down Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tribes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
