The two haven't been in touch for years, but the proximity of death forces them to confront the ghosts of their past. It is also a portrait of life in a typical small town in the midst of Mediterranean hinterland. Plunging into the anxieties of the community, MATER subtly uncovers class, status, and gender issues that shape Anka's and Jasna's personalities - their stubbornness, strength, and tragic flaws.","popularity":1.23,"poster_path":"/k9kYT1IIqu5t7slPROL2BQSApRM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84667,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sekvenca","origin_country":"HR"},{"id":104330,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wake Up Films","origin_country":"RS"},{"id":120889,"logo_path":"/3ww1BpkpNPGHU8n3uHV0rFJA7QD.png","name":"Les Films de l’œil sauvage","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"},{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"}],"release_date":"2019-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Matriarch","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
