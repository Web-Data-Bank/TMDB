With his sleazy, below-the-belt campaign tactics, he's hell-bent on destroying his opponents reputations and getting himself and his wife to the top of the heap in Washington D.C. In \"SCHOOL, GIRLS, & YOU,\" it's the 1950's -- and strait-laced Everdale University is about to go \"coed\". In order to prepare it's student body for the onslaught of \"females\" on campus, they present this hard-hitting educational film. Wally Bile is the \"wrong-way\" role model with Science Professor, Dr. Bloom. Dr. Bloom explains the vital \"do's and don'ts\" on dating women, and the all-important \"warning signs\" and \"danger signals\" to look out for when close-encountering the opposite sex.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9Bf4KwiriqpFCqkJGHO358FpBIC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Likely Stories Vol. 2","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
