Liborio and Ticona and other Bolivian indigenous soldiers are lost in the hell of the Chaco, under the commandment of German Captain Kundt. They're looking for the Paraguayan enemy that they haven't seen for months, and that they will never find. They leave together in a search that will make them realize, progressively, the destiny they have been pushed into and the inevitable condition of a defeated troop. They're walking like shadows, wandering forever in the middle of dust and silence.","popularity":4.985,"poster_path":"/hCR2i9rK6P4VHMfFw2MT5jDGJcN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79782,"logo_path":null,"name":"Murillo Cine","origin_country":"AR"},{"id":101374,"logo_path":"/25yTZporNMlTU9I2VATTW83nD55.png","name":"Color Monster","origin_country":"BO"},{"id":75415,"logo_path":"/jnTkKFlcvMEDNBqE8nwWjP5QzwN.png","name":"PASTO","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"BO","name":"Bolivia"}],"release_date":"2020-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Aymara","iso_639_1":"ay","name":""},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"},{"english_name":"Quechua","iso_639_1":"qu","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chaco","video":false,"vote_average":7.9,"vote_count":47}
