Although his father discovers this horrible coincidence when he meets his wife after the war, he keeps this realization secret. Eventually his father has a breakdown, confessing his tragic story, forcing Ben to be torn between his love of his parents and internal feelings of betrayal by his own fervent efforts to assimilate.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A4tqM50Z7jeqlfUw5NfCzKhyUy8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1992-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Some Divine Wind","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
