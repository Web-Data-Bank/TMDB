But the real \"red planet\" is a trickster; strikingly beautiful, yet sweetly sinister. Even as a growing armada of instruments arrive, this small cold world conceals its secrets. This film merges the mythic and the scientific to show that Mars may not be what we imagine. Settlers beware: the Red Planet may change us as much as we change it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9VhCFGvSQAPQjHzWsSi0D1AUBko.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127607,"logo_path":null,"name":"MagellanTV","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mars Calling: Manifest Destiny or Grand Illusion?","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
