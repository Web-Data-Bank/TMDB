As New York City's preeminent No Wave icon from the late 70's, Lunch has forged a lifetime of music and spoken word performance devoted to the utter right of any woman to indulge, seek pleasure, and to say \"fuck you!\" as loud as any man. In this time of endless attacks on women this is a rallying cry to acknowledge the only thing that is going to bring us together - ART...as the universal salve to all of our traumas.","popularity":0.622,"poster_path":"/uy6wUqAomMhODOkRDjF1hPafOFf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39134,"logo_path":"/sijjN3vMtjCnc1LkCM7HSBErcO3.png","name":"Kino Lorber","origin_country":""},{"id":10932,"logo_path":"/AscjWwkpQC23EZgRxbeOqs4KhRI.png","name":"The Criterion Channel","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lydia Lunch: The War Is Never Over","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":5}
