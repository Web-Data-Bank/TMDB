With the inauguration of Roch Marc Christian Kaboré in 2015, Burkina Faso finally has a democratically elected president again. According to rapper, poet and activist Serge Bambara, the country is now in a transitional period. Sankara's democratic ideals have received fresh impetus, but what does the hope for a working democracy mean when it has already been systematically destroyed in the past? As 'Smockey', Bambara records socially-conscious rap in line with his political activism. Uncertainty awaits Kaboré's presidency and Smockey monitors it all.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6KhMfLkrwBeflxYhyTuMbfNC2yJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":148034,"logo_path":null,"name":"Africalia","origin_country":""},{"id":148035,"logo_path":null,"name":"Indigo Mood Films","origin_country":"SN"},{"id":148036,"logo_path":null,"name":"Semfilms","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"BF","name":"Burkina Faso"},{"iso_3166_1":"SN","name":"Senegal"}],"release_date":"2019-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Time is On Our Side","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
