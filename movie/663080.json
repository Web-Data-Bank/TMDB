The recording took place before the Royal Family at London's Royal Albert Hall and before a packed house of Lords, Ladies, and Gentlemen. Red tosses off jokes, one-liners, and works through elaborate pantomime routines both classic and new. Highlights include Skelton's uproarious \"Guzzler's Gin\" routine, his \"Fisherman and the Little Boy\" mime, and his heartbreaking \"Old Man Watching a Parade.\" Additionally , he mimes a scarecrow and an old golfer. His legendary rapport with audiences is clearly evident here.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1984-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Red Skelton: A Royal Command Performance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
