Apprehensive of their future and unwilling to suffer a deteriorated life, they write to the President of India, pleading guilty of what they believe to be a crime they have committed and asking for mercy. While awaiting the consequences, they try out desperate measures to fulfil their long-cherished wish. Inspired from a true story, this film explores the life of the couple, through contemplative aesthetics, who exhausted by their present, pursue a shared belief that challenges the status quo.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kpNUqso1MQ4Ulc7SmXMZCJFwj09.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127674,"logo_path":null,"name":"Satyajit Ray Film and Television Institute","origin_country":"IN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2019-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"DEATH IS MY BIRTHRIGHT","title":"An Irrelevant Dialogue","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
