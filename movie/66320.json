His wife Radha is pregnant, but she meets with an accident, resulting in the child being stillborn. One case that comes up before Gopinath is that of Murugan, who has been charged with assault and battery. Misled by false evidence, Gopinath sentences Murugan to imprisonment. Murugan's wife commits suicide, fearing the advances of the local landlord, and her infant son Ravi is orphaned. Gopinath conceals Ravi's true identity from him and raises him as his own son.  Ravi grows up to become a lawyer. Meanwhile, Murugan is released from prison and searches for his son. Though beseeched by Radha not to do so, Gopinath is unable to lie and reveals to Ravi the truth about his parentage.","popularity":0.811,"poster_path":"/cr4OWRTgRpl4PA1ZCGrflJQ0K4G.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129780,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vallimanalan Picture","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tamil","iso_639_1":"ta","name":"தமிழ்"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Justice Gopinath","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
