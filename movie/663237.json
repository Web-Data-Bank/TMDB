Thousands of people are splashing out on the latest icon of social status - even if their backyards are too small and the neighbours don't like it. At the centre of the craze is Hot Tub Superstore; a family run business specialising in the weird and wonderful world of hot tubs. This quirky ob-doc follows the showroom exploits of the sales team and their customers. It reveals the often comical efforts of ingenious delivery men manoeuvring hot tubs down narrow British streets. Most tantalising of all, Hot Tub Britain takes a peek over the proverbial garden fence to examine the social politics bubbling underneath the hot tub obsession.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kGeISw8vbHJFOMptNRywaoYY4ha.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3448,"logo_path":"/dcA8JDfnnQPMaq8lv2CCiYrNe0S.png","name":"ITV","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":64434,"logo_path":"/33HLeDgJcPEzZC8rltTCixgnw4j.png","name":"Shiver","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2014-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hot Tub Britain","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
