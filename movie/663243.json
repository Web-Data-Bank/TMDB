Dr. Nof Atamna-Ismaeel - the first Muslim Arab to win Israel's MasterChef - is on a quest to make a social change through food. And so, she founded the A-sham Arabic Food Festival in Haifa. There, pairs of Arab and Jewish chefs collaborate on mouthwatering dishes like kishek (a Syrian yogurt soup), and qatayef (a dessert typically served during Ramadan), as we savor the taste of hope and discover the food of their region free from political and religious boundaries.","popularity":1.316,"poster_path":"/30rQFxkJkKkELp2FRDLEwbYdVb8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":155077,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gemini Girls Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Hummus has no borders.","title":"Breaking Bread","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
