The animation film is a rhythmic, poetic surge, comparing us, our lives, and our very humanness to burning paper in the breeze. Images of sheets of paper flying through the broken windows of the burning palace are juxtaposed with images of the crowds as they convene and disperse. The music charges these powerful images with its own aliveness and colour.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":78289,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tindrum Animation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2019-10-24","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Riot: by definition, a violent disruption of the existing order.","title":"Suggestion of Least Resistance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
