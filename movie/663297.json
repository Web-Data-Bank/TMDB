There’s, however, the other goalie, Miky – and his position seems unshakeable. The team doesn’t welcome David with open arms either. Captain Jerry and his gang do as they please, while the team follows the ‘law of the pack’. David has been weakened by his recently discovered diabetes, and that is not tolerated here. He is still coming to terms with his body, learning to estimate the insulin doses his life depends on. On the team, David is the outsider, bracing the avalanche of bullying that gradually gains speed.","popularity":0.893,"poster_path":"/jRbM55HIvpjRGcRyB8PtRAKz94j.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84487,"logo_path":null,"name":"8Heads Productions","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":37158,"logo_path":null,"name":"Furia Film","origin_country":"SK"},{"id":85171,"logo_path":"/1O7e8sk2hazDqDdK59ZehQHQQ7g.png","name":"Ego Media","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"},{"iso_3166_1":"SK","name":"Slovakia"}],"release_date":"2020-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Pack","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
