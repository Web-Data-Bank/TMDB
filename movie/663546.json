She is the founding publisher of rabble.ca, Canada’s irreverent progressive online news source, and a former president of the National Action Committee on the Status of Women, Canada’s largest women’s group.  Shot in kinetic bursts of super 8, the only voice is Judy’s, impelling a trek through a devastated family, the struggle for women’s right to choose and the challenge of neo-liberalism. A series of six public moments (marked by speeches and TV spots) structure a life collage that arrives in six movements. A fractured movie for fractured times.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4mau05TY57x6UE3dtMfzu0nz8n9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Judy Versus Capitalism","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
