With Doria's help, Steele overcomes his Bohemian excesses and stays away from the influence of the jealous but wealthy Mrs. Schuyler (Miriam Folger). He finally achieves success, but he also begins to neglect Doria. When she catches him kissing the dreaded Mrs. Schuyler, Doria decides to leave him. But when she goes to his studio to drop off her farewell note, she discovers another sculptor, Harry North, copying one of Steele's masterpieces. Later she comes over to Steele's studio and, in front of a crowd of people, smashes the statue to bits.

At the base of the real statue she has left a letter of reconciliation to Steele.","popularity":0.841,"poster_path":"/2s3XAamGT64IHYkKFQwg8N2Gm2r.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1918-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Who Loved Him Best?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
