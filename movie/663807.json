The film follows his journey to Western Iran, where he unearths the ancient traditions and teachings of Ghadamyar's faith known as Yarsanism, and its relationship to the mysterious Tanbur as a meditative instrument. The film takes audiences on a musical and visual quest among rugged landscapes of Western Iran to experience undiscovered voices and spiritual awakening. We witness the collective prayer of Yarsani Tanburists, as a practice to maintain their spiritual identity and search for inner beauty.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rSoEwDEvE27QXWGLKpd1NyYwsVU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":130318,"logo_path":null,"name":"New Wave Production","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2019-02-21","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Kurdish","iso_639_1":"ku","name":""},{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A film by Aref Mohammadi","title":"Song of God","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
