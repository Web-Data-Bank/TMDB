No political rights were granted to the general public, and the government implemented a plan to exterminate all opposition. Left-leaning citizens were detained and tortured in illegal detention centers with no official acknowledgement that these operations were being held. Between 1976 and 1983, the military regime was responsible for 30,000 disappeared persons. An estimate of 500 children were born in captivity and given illegally to adoptive parents, in many cases linked to the perpetrators of their parentsâ€™ murder. Although the children were not aware of their identity, their relatives were, especially their biological grandparents, who never gave up looking for them. This docudrama, adapted from a popular Argentine mini-series, explores these stories.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Missing Identity","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
