The possibilities of vibration and sound are explored through a range of scavenged materials: old bed-springs, metal coils, piano strings, heated metal bars, dropped into water. In the tape's most striking image, a burning chair twists and turns from a cable, as if a symbol for some unexplained spontaneous combustion of domestic objects. While the video uses an almost process-oriented approach, showing the concrete techniques, which create each sound and effect, the elements are brought together in a composition that is almost musical.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vQDyNp6jR2qBRV96MVHkUQjQwcQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thought Crimes in the Satiation Pool","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
