In a characterization that is part dictator and part preacher, Hall, flanked by emblematic red banners, recites a litany of clich√©s: \"Mind your superiors... Obey the laws... Leave politics to the politicians...\" The monotonous repetition of these aphorisms imbues them with a sinister, Orwellian ambiguity. Through theatricality and spectacle, this work continues Hall's investigation of the manipulation of images and language as signs of power.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This is the Truth","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
