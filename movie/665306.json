The departure point was a belief that in Gypsy culture, as in others, collective memory is retained through the interrelationship of four phenomena: past places, past persons; present spaces, present persons. The challenge was to create a sense of these ‘memory spaces’ in the form of a film: a multi-disciplinary, multi-creator approach was essential in order to do justice to the nature of collective memory.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chuvihoni","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
