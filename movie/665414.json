It is considered the first sound film in Brazil. Luiz de Barros's own script is based on a novel by the writer Menotti del Picchia. It tells the story of two hillbillies and an Italian settler who arrive in São Paulo. Naively, the three are tricked by a con man into believing they bought a tram. They end up without money, having to return to the countryside. It's considered a lost film, but a reconstituted version was made by researchers at the Universidade Federal Fluminense.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/MfM3xixILmf49IZ7o4vGWEZhx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128025,"logo_path":null,"name":"Syncrocinex","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"1929-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No more suckers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
