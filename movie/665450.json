The piece is staged at Shelburne Farms' vast, historic Breeding Barn which is defined by soaring clerestories and an expansive dirt floor matching the grand scale of Bausch's radical artistry. An ensemble of thirty dancers give an evocative performance rooted in each person's authentic emotions. The work combines traditional ensemble choreography with character-driven theatrical scenes, to explore themes of human relationships colored by passion, inspiration, and loss. This breathtaking film features stunning cinematography, providing a propulsive visual experience that breaks narrative boundaries and reminds audiences of the richness and depths in their own lives.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dear Pina","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
