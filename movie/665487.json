But without catastrophism, neither fury, nor melancholy, far from the sad passions. On the contrary, Under the skydeploys an ode to the energy of nature: the energy of all things, from the most volatile, a bubble, to the most mineral, a rock wall; energy in the diversity of its forms, from the most intangible, lights and breaths, to the most spectacular, torrents of fire; the energy in its states and textures so well extended by the composition of Martin Wheeler, the kineticism of the rustling winds, the spring of balance, the power of a monumental rest.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sous le ciel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
