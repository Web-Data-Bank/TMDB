It is 1987. The dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos has just been overthrown. Newly elected President Corazon Aquino struggles to wrench control of the country from her own military. A Rustling of Leaves poses the key question facing the revolutionaries and the Filipino Left: Should the People’s Movement continue the guerilla war, or do they dare enter legal politics and reveal the hidden face of the revolution?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iEviraFjtZbwEnt1QdalFticOJ0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129002,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kalasikas Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":16957,"logo_path":"/pZkfDLQKeLwoUj7hW7XuGlTx0T8.png","name":"Britdoc Foundation","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"1988-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Rustling of Leaves: Inside the Philippine Revolution","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
