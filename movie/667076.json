Now 90-year-old, Paul Nizon grants insights into his life and work in a self-ironic, direct manner. The intimate portrait of a great literary outsider emerges, for whom the risk of life and the risk of writing merge into one and the same work of art.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wTvKxKrdyVigz7L29OyOvnXYRB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10358,"logo_path":"/pvgiWovEFHYoOO49V7arAhitWTM.png","name":"Ventura Film","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":20960,"logo_path":"/9mO8Z3dcW6ISVMeCv7TbXtWXdGl.png","name":"RSI","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":12431,"logo_path":"/3m45frhaRCLsCKuMtuj7ZwfGwBB.png","name":"SRG SSR","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2020-01-22","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paul Nizon: Der Nagel im Kopf","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
