The biographical film acknowledges the proletarian tradition and is considered to be one of the most important documentary films of the late 60s that tried to combine the private sphere with the reality of society. The film's fascination lies, above all, in the personal charisma of the miner's widow from Duisburg. She knows how to tell the story in a vivacious and exciting way.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1tflTtnT1molYvcaghYBfpnrQ00.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1968-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Why is Mrs B.
