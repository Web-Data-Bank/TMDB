In a country like Brasil, of such abyssal social inequality as there is here, it's urgent for me in cinema to talk about the class to which I belong, the class-who-lives-on-labor. And, alongside that, about the labor relations, the survival, the unemployment, the increasingly impoverished life, the small popular uprisings and the confrontations with the non natural order of things. In \"Bread and People\", we deal with ruins. And in the struggle of the old against the new, we face mainly the ruin of an idea of progress, and the debris of a critical anti capitalist art today. We've deepened our investigation of an epic, historical and dialectical cinema, using the materials of inspiration themselves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/55AwnjqMMYxV7HHqrMCovrnzpx1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128341,"logo_path":null,"name":"Coletivo Tela Suja Filmes","origin_country":""},{"id":128342,"logo_path":null,"name":"Desalambrar Filmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2020-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bread and People","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
