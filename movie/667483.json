It's the South Coast derby. Perhaps the rarest played major derby in the UK and certainly one of the most ferocious, thanks to two cities and sets of fans who have a hell of a lot of passion, pride, and personality as well as an edge you wouldn't want to cross.  It's Portsmouth v Southampton for the first time in seven years, in the third round of the Carabao Cup and just like every other time they've met, there’s going to be scenes.","popularity":0.634,"poster_path":"/7FWT4UVsaIy1i3wNhybmB9YO2qF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128350,"logo_path":null,"name":"Copa90","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"“My City Could Beat Up Your City”","title":"Derby Days South Coast: Portsmouth v Southampton","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
