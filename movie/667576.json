In the exact location of where the filmmaker is living and realizing this project, trypillian people lived over 5,000 year ago. A modern day, post soviet brick factory in the village uses the exact same process to make bricks that the trypillian people used to make pots. Through this same process, and the unexplained burning of the trypillian homes, we have fired clay remnants of their presence in this village in very large numbers. A reknowned local archeologist talks about these people and their relationship to land, clay and black gold.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Clay","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
