Filmed with a dreamy, surreal quality, 'The People in the House' dwells within the tension between harmony and chaos.\" - Liz Czach, Toronto Film Festival Catalogue, Canada, 1995","popularity":0.631,"poster_path":"/f7yZDi4r4jKAMRmiJ44bftDpIKI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The People in the House","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
