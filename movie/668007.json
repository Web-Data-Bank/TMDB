The film explores Rivera's life and work, including his stormy relationship with Frida Kahlo and the destruction of his famous mural at Rockefeller Center. Shot on location in Mexico and the United States, the film includes a remarkable collection of archival film and photographs, much of which has not been seen before. The text is drawn from the writings of Rivera and Kahlo and from other historical texts. Using Rivera's own words, this richly detailed film brings to life the difficulty he faced in his transition from studio artist to public and political artist, and the conflicts that arose from that point onward.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xVzu2R9kvKtFScGdFAJOyRo0qv4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Diego Rivera: I Paint What I See","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
