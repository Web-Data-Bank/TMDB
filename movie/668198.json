The reservoir, the life-giver and life-taker, connects these four characters who face loss, death, hope, and love. And they are ultimately swept away by unrelenting waves of change.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oskLEn1lOzIVQk4lpkkhCnctokS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"2014-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Standing in Still Water","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
