Not only did he not have any idea that this dramatic act was a possibility, neither did his other friends. Perhaps it had something to do with his having an unrequited love for a beautiful young neighbor, an attraction Ismaël also feels. Perhaps it had something to do with drugs, or a problem with a universally disliked teacher. Throughout most of the film, the young survivors discuss their departed classmate.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/mSOfbCX1ZIQ6gAuA33tnAYR1And.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":635,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Alain Sarde","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":26466,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lola Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":8162,"logo_path":null,"name":"Home Made Movies","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1993-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Young Werther","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":9}
