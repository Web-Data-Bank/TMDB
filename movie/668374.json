Beside their daily explorations, the teenagers restage scenes from the theater play Düşler Ülkesi (Land of Dreams). The premiere of the play in 1982 was overshadowed by a bomb threat. The contradiction in the film title of wanting to predict the past is a reference to the continuous experience of racism, but can also be read as a playful suggestion to break out of habitual patterns of thought and behavior—conveyed in the film through YouTube comments on Childish Gambino's song Redbone.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8C7qlQ8R5DpheugsZTS5ZCe3GUQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This Makes Me Want To Predict The Past","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
