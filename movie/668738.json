But does their fabled competitive hierarchy also exist in the wild? Over a period of three years, our filmmaker obtained unique footage of a family of wild wolves as has never been seen before in Europe. This is the first documentary about wild wolves in Germany shot exclusively in the wild; it shows how similar the social structures of humans and wolves are and dispels myths about a fascinating wild animal.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6WSXiTUGQBgyq9e6VZ6J9sBDvBc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Germany's Wild Wolves - As They Really Are","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
