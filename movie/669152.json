Nevertheless human intervention is visible in almost every breathtaking vista Alexis Destoop recorded.  Cold, calm footage of snowfields, bodies of water, industry and research stations pass by, while a narrator from the near future reports on an investigation whose object remains concealed. In the meantime he reflects on the border as a political construct, the intangible, mythical power of nature and the expansion of fossil-fuel extraction to areas that were virtually impenetrable before global warming.  Humming, growling machines provide constant background buzz in this subjective exploration of a landscape where past and future meld. Northern Drift is an aesthetic, philosophical investigation of mankind and its environment – a relationship akin to shadow-boxing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/imE2Hul52MQNVcGWqpSgZSYcUjA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":139540,"logo_path":null,"name":"An Archer A Weaver","origin_country":""},{"id":81068,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stempel Films","origin_country":""},{"id":139541,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pikene på Broen","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2020-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Northern Drift","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
