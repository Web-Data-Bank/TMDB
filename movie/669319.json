In keeping with earlier releases in this series, Steven Wilson’s approach to this album for new stereo & 5.1 mixes is to faithfully retain the spirit & sounds of the original album mix, while applying modern mix techniques to bring further clarity to the individual instrument, vocal & overdubs for each track. The songs, instantly familiar to a multitude of Yes fans, remain so, with the new mixes – especially in 5.1 form – providing a greater sense of space for each voice to be heard, Anderson’s voice seems to join the listener in the room, Howe & Wakeman’s solos glisten with clarity & Bruford/Squire remind all that they were unmatched as a rhythm section during that period.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ytdcFhdG0YmBaCtWgQzALrvEMdg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yes: Close to the Edge","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
