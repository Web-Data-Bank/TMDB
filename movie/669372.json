Juxtaposing refugee migration with digital migration, both of which characterize migration in the 21st century, the work creates a speculative space-time by interrogating the “ways of existence” and the “ways of representation” of the Yemeni refugees who recently arrived in South Korea. Reflected here is the state of affairs in which refugees are treated as a kind of malware or virus that threaten the immune system of the nation state.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yFCAyXjtoejVfdyV0mOd9Syno9X.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126575,"logo_path":"/81avcuOvF9fyQHyxSBrHdk7DVZO.png","name":"Seesaw Pictures","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2019-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Porosity Valley 2: Tricksters","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
