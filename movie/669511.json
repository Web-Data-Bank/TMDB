Jamil is a get-up-and-go carpenter, following in his father's footsteps. Milad is a sensitive trumpeter and dreamer. As their home country, Syria, sinks further into war, Jamil emigrates first to Beirut and then makes an illegal journey to Sweden. Milad stays in Damascus, but eventually can’t take it any longer and decides to leave to Berlin. Their cousin Wissam records their journey for over five years, bringing back childhood memories while questioning the true meaning of home. The traumatic war in Syria plays a background role in this documentary, which focuses more on the psychological effects of being uprooted and the way the brothers, who had previously hardly travelled, deal with emigration. It draws with humility and admiration the human ability to cope with change, as radical as it can be. Jamil and Milad are achievers, each adapting his own way.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bButEjIcHjxMJ6ozNMzVrFFCrV6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2567,"logo_path":"/wia94WcCrJC8SXxTcEqeqQS66Hk.png","name":"Abbout Productions","origin_country":"LB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"}],"release_date":"2022-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Are From There","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
