Shot by noted cinematographer Michel Thomas-d’Hoste, it documents the construction of a traditional canoe, fishing along the Coucouchou River, a procession marking the Christian feast of the Assumption, and the departure of children for residential schools—an event presented here in an uncritical light. Perrault’s narration, delivered by an anonymous male voice, underscores the film’s outsider gaze on its Indigenous subjects. The film is from Au Pays de Neufve-France (1960), a series produced by Crawley Films, an important early Canadian producer of documentary films.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1960-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ka Ke Ki Ku","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
