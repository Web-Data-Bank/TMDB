Far from the world of bland, impersonal chains, Wildwood welcomes you to 50's and 60's motels with names like the Astronaut, the Eden Roc and the Bonanza - or whatever was new and exotic at the time. It's also home to the country's biggest boardwalk and a rich musical history. ..","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yZcJhmVTKNgdm1EwFsgvewaIbyj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Wildwood Days","title":"Wildwood Days","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
