He immediately decides to get another one but he shows poor judgement in regards that the one he picks is unkowingly the home of a mountain lion. The lion returns to Goofy's penthouse to reclaim his tree, notices the hammock, and decides this is a much better source of relaxation than laying on a tree branch. Thus, he tries to remove Goofy from the hammock so he can relax himself and eventually a battle ensues.","popularity":2.729,"poster_path":"/swSOzBicz7P1ECXcQqldNIVHyAV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1951-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lion Down","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":22}
