BrazziBots are an instant success, but media outlets are reporting that the initial crop of bots has been malfunctioning... with disastrous results. Investigative journalist Riley Reid is given the career opportunity of a lifetime when BrazziBots creator Dr. Mick Blue invites her to his laboratory in an effort to promote his new and improved line of servient robots, BrazziBots 2.0. Riley's journalistic instincts sense something is amiss and quickly uncovers a secret that will shock the world - the BrazziBots are using their sexual prowess for the sole purpose of taking over the world and creating a utopia, free of humankind's flaws. Will Riley's discovery make it out of Dr. Blue's laboratory, or will humanity fall prey to the BrazziBots' voracious sexual appetites?","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/39lrUrHA7hfyXs6lgbbLARWNX9T.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8552,"logo_path":"/oPgtjtAvkg75aYMLdeAnrwXEaIw.png","name":"Brazzers","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2019-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":133,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"BrazziBots","video":false,"vote_average":4.667,"vote_count":3}
