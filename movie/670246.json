The contrast of black and white and vibrant color, along with movement allows the viewer to let go as the screen becomes kaleidoscopic and other dimensional. Nature offers us its own optical illusions and filmic qualities if we give it space and time.  This film is my attempt at doing it justice.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5sVFgMw7HF9czMHRB48nSNfxIw1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-08-23","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nature's Optical Toy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
