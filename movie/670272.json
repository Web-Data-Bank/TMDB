Together they overcome the obstacles that separate the earthly world from the spiritual world. Once in the land of the spirits, things are different: other ways govern the supernatural. But Mãtãnãg is not dead, and his soul must return to living with the living. Back in his village and reunited with his relatives, new vicissitudes during a ritual will provide the opportunity for them to once again be alive and dead.
