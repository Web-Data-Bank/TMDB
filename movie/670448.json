A bruised man, a handsome poqué, but a survivor. With broad strokes of the brush, humor and friendships, he brings life to the windows of Montreal, embellishes the hearts of merchants and the souls of passers-by. Painter-poster artist – an endangered profession – Claude Dolbec chose the margins to better rediscover his fellow human beings and a sense of beauty. An inspiring love story, a story of extraordinary resilience.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6LOwEZFfrgIgxk7HAJ6RdMrzVao.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":130777,"logo_path":null,"name":"Films de l'Oeil","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2018-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Claude n'est pas mort","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
