Fiery Sarah O'Rourke rides the same coach, handcuffed to lawman Bill Speakes and headed for the hangman. In a few hours, all should reach their destinations. But the trail they travel takes an unexpected turn: Cooper and O'Rourke are soon off the stage and running for their lives. The law ends and the chase begins in a very alive tale of wanted-dead-or-alive fugitives (Linda Fiorentino and Craig Sheffer) pursued by a marshal (Sam Elliott) who's a law unto himself.","popularity":2.518,"poster_path":"/1wH2QZv3aTBOmM7DMhpu1qK0pNp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4618,"logo_path":null,"name":"Turner Home Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":2090,"logo_path":"/jYlUttNqcN5u1pzMQrh5AEhZ27t.png","name":"Motion Picture Corporation of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"No one escapes from Marshal Bill Speakes.","title":"The Desperate Trail","video":false,"vote_average":4.6,"vote_count":17}
