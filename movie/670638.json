She encounters fearful, apathetic, and aggressive bacteria. The film plays on fears of foreign bodies invading us and our country. It is a child's fantasy of their mother's journey to a new unfamiliar land, made more uncanny and dreamlike with the use of classic special effects and a sci-fi experimental soundtrack.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mother's Gut","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
