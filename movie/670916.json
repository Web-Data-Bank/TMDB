Grandmothers tell stories of biblical monsters while gently slapping the listener with a shoe. The daily routine of sunset ball play is interrupted only by the call of fresh fried sausages, or, perhaps, by the beckoning of a colorful alcoholic beverage. But this day is not a typical one. This day, the sea does not bring the usual boat engine, fish scull or metal briefcase ashore. Instead, it delivers a woman and a doll. A group of Mexican hipsters beach bums come upon this woman and her doll. Louise -- who may or may not be a disgruntled hippie dropping out, or a failed Ponzi schemer seeking solace in the ocean -- responds to her new surroundings with a coma-like stare.","popularity":0.661,"poster_path":"/lejIZ7VtNsBmjGuKDwcvXxOzMiP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Living need not be so serious - surrender to the mysteries of life!","title":"Mystico Fantástico!","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
