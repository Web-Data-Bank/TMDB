It was a brilliant idea to make a video as well as an audio recording. Cellists will welcome the chance to study Rostropovich's bowing and fingering techniques, close up and at leisure. And music-lovers will welcome the visuals of the recording location, a French church whose architecture, statues, and flickering candles complement the music.","popularity":0.841,"poster_path":"/k8TkNwVPkvPpIj8tDaYuwtrW4q5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14259,"logo_path":null,"name":"EMI","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":240,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mstislav Rostropovich - Bach Cello Suites","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
