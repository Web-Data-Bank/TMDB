Dr. Darnell (Darren Toderick), his doctor and the world's most irresponsible psychiatrist, decides to force Lance to confront his fears by returning to the rural scene of his friends' deaths. Along for the ride on this ill-advised field trip are two other of the doctor's patients, a whimpering agoraphobic (Justin Peeler) and a busty paranoid narcissist (Lindsey Queen). But waiting for them, in the woods, are a trio of backwoods psychopaths with a gruesome passion for gardening. And these twisted green thumbs traffic in a fertilizer that's decidedly more red. Part gross-out comedy, part exploitation gore-fest, Mulch is chockablock with disgustingly over the top blood, guts, boobs, and dark comedy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eLoncfWNm2ljeNrvXq8F2SXCXjU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128852,"logo_path":null,"name":"286 Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mulch","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
