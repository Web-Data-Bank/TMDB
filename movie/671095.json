The two principal motifs are human and vegetal, with a few animals briefly glimpsed in passing. The primates of the title (for once, this film has a title, and an insistent one at that) are the men, women and children who visit the museum. A man, a woman, a family with children detach themselves from their surroundings; their images are reworked, re-framed and edited so that they become intermingled with a series of luminous wide shots of vegetation. In this air-conditioned location, the film-maker has managed to give a certain luxuriance to the surrounding nature; the human visitors, in turn, reclaim something of their cosmic dimension from dubious civilization.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Danse des primates au Muséum d’Histoires Naturelles","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
