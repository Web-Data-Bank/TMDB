On top of managing your own fears and expectations, you feel obliged to wear a brave face for your loved ones. Dani brings such a conversation to life, as 30-year old Danielle delivers her grim breast cancer prognosis to her mother. A story that's as unique and personal as it is disturbingly universal. Using stop-motion animation, Dani shows us how a simple phone call can be a study of human courage, faith, and love.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ztBE1J0jEv4IiI1iYLfYFFoxvzk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dani","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
