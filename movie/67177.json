Everyone in the family writes to him, describing the events of their lives, as they drift into a kind of conventionality which would perhaps have horrified them earlier. Only Michael’s girlfriend Mara, the mother of his child, retains her independence, even though it is through the help of Michael’s increasingly conventional friends and family that she survives.","popularity":1.047,"poster_path":"/m0JV2CqeLpEPCMlzYBXjfohWEsq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":101892,"logo_path":null,"name":"Flag Production","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":9387,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cineriz","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1976-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dear Michele","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":9}
