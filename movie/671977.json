It deals with the topic of implacability of human optimism and fantasy. In a sad manner it tells us a humorous story of a man living double life: one of a beaten little clerk, humiliated by his arrogant boss, imperious wife and misbehaved descendant; the other of a spoiled hero of a dream empire full of beautiful and tender women, flowers and fantastic figures. From artistic point of view is the film based on Adolf Born's lithographs.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oNjZd2eVpBffkOqKyg9XsHQpmIX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13637,"logo_path":null,"name":"Krátký film Praha – Studio Bratři v triku","origin_country":"XC"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XC","name":"Czechoslovakia"}],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Imago","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
