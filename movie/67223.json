Deadly bored, he sinks into the depths of depression and requests the help of a psychiatrist. But his imagination is far more effective: In his dreams, he chases gangsters in London. Finally, some small-time crooks find a way to help \"their\" policeman out of his emotional misery: They steal a memorial from the market square and thus help Holms to a spectacular case.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bafNMZqRCbOBOoStTGThuqkyXcO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":602,"logo_path":"/pVsXRFbYVDe5BhsATCAh1rt5F0k.png","name":"DEFA","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"}],"release_date":"1966-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hände hoch oder ich schieße","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":2}
