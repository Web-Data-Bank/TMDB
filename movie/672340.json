They are between 6 and 11 years old. Very fond of each other, they film themselves, comparing and giving one another support. They also tend to annoy one another, are at times envious, even rejecting each other. What is it like for a little girl to grow up in a world of intense professional and competitive dancing? Closely following the emotions and dilemmas experienced by our young characters, this film explores and probes into a territory that we’ve all navigated, though many of us have forgotten: childhood.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iIfEQZrhfxr3ZM6Rub2k3H4Tzfu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126383,"logo_path":"/yQMBDbZWqZ7Nj72DixW3AA6I3KS.png","name":"Pyla Prod","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":36744,"logo_path":null,"name":"Be for Films","origin_country":""},{"id":310,"logo_path":"/4Gp5A4YdjPBfsHT47ngHMaXWmb9.png","name":"CNC","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2020-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Little Ballerinas","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":3}
