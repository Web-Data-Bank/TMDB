Dimitra’s home is located near the place where a great dam is being built and lies right in the middle of the area destined to become a lake after construction is completed. By a strange quirk of fate, the materials used in the construction of the dam are a product of a cement company named “Heracles”, so that it seems that the age-old contest between Acheloos and Heracles continues to the present day! Dimitris, Costas and Petros decide to pay their grandmother a visit and make a documentary.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iajmxpC20XXuDPRw86YeTicUERc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"1997-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hercules, the River Achelous, and My Grandmother","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
