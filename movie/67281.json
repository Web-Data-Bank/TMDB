The live show was recorded at the end of the Post tour on February 27, 1997, at a special fan-club only free concert at the Shepherds Bush Empire in London, England. The majority of the songs are taken from the album Post, as well as some from her first album Debut. The track \"I Go Humble\" is a B-side, and appears on the \"Isobel\" single. Many of the performances from this concert can be found on the Post Live album, released as part of the Live Box in 2003 and later made available separately.
