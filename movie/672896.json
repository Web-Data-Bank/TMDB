Using transducers made from window screens and nylon cord, and amplifying the tall grass and weeds, I shot several cartridges of Super 8 in very windy weather. The last one was shot in a gentle rain and the rainfall 'plucked' the windharps as it fell, while I filmed a fisherman preparing his boat. The middle section of this film was shot in a small fishing village Port Kerwin , about 60 miles south of St. John's, at the studio of artist Don Wright. Here, I amplified pine trees, set up windharps and recorded the gulls overlooking a bay beneath me. This film is dedicated to the memory of Don Wright, his courage and his work as an artist.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"St. Johns Harbor & Port Kerwin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
