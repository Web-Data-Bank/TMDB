In Massy, in the southern suburbs of Paris, we lived at a time of economic growth, full employment and promising future. It was the 60s. We are at the beginning of the 2000s. They dwell in a climate of crisis and exclusion. Most of these are Roma and are fleeing a country that rejects them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vE91h0XdDOOviaUc624IXz9GKKz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34915,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zeugma Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2014-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Souvenirs d'un futur radieux","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
