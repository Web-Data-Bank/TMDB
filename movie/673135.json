Tammy Loertscher’s fetus was given an attorney, while the courts denied Tammy her constitutional rights. In this timely documentary, we see her sent to jail, and then forced to challenge a Wisconsin law that eroded her privacy, her right to due process, and her body sovereignty. Through her story, Personhood reframes the abortion debate to encompass the growing system of laws that criminalize and police pregnant women. These little known laws, which now exist in 38 states, disproportionately target lower income women and women of color. At the intersection of the erosion of women’s rights, the war on drugs, and mass incarceration, Tammy’s experience reveals the dangerous consequences that these laws have on America’s mothers and families.","popularity":0.678,"poster_path":"/sfXWNlvfGrp8Onz2E74fnJsCtcT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Personhood","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
