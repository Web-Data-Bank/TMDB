Two men arrive in the desert under a turbulent sky. They appear at the far extremes of the frame and walk toward us on a trajectory that takes them closer to each other, until they are walking side by side. Eventually they cross paths and begin to separate. The gap between them widens until they leave the outer edges of the frame.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u1i14uii3nkhFXCc7weHo7lEtp3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Walking on the Edge","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
