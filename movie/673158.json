A a film showing how birds returned to an environment once devastated by industry. The lakes around the northern Slovenian town of Velenje, placed in the Central Europe, are geographic center of the film. They emerged as the land above the lignite mines subsided and the depressions were filled with water. The mines started operating at the end of the 19th century. In the mid 20th century a power plant was built that caused a severe pollution of the lake waters to the extent of the lakes not being fit for any kind of life. As a consequence many birds moved from these parts. After a long ecological restoration that started in the mid 1980s, life returned to the water. Gradually the birds returned as well, including some there were previously never observed in this area.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jpgGGccHySkEqKHoE81LsFNaL6U.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129171,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fotokom","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"2018-08-26","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Birds of the Lakes Return","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
