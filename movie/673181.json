The greedy Mr. Butler (Shi Hui) convinces the suicidal “Charley” that he might as well endorse some cigarettes as he jumps out of his office window, and maybe wear a particular suit too. A true cinematic oddity, this Korean War–era propaganda piece is a satire that Frank Tashlin could envy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/skvX2B7i20mehmpkrQRDu3updGs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":47196,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wenhua Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"1952-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Window to America","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
