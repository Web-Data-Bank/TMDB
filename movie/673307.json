In his immersive documentary debut, Mischa Richter, whose artist family has been living in Provincetown for nearly a century, explores his home through shared moments and conversations with locals, pilgrims, outcasts, fishermen, drag queens and spirit guides in an exploration of what freedom and community mean in America today.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/Ah8I0t07LmMaDlEJQJvkXZlWKxv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98506,"logo_path":null,"name":"Under the Influence Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":197285,"logo_path":null,"name":"Land's End Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":67876,"logo_path":"/yesiWKbP7vGeCla6Bx41ikRTdY0.png","name":"King Bee Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Am A Town","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
