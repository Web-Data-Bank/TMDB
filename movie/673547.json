The silhouettes of three dancers (red, green and blue) are played off one another while the grids and ladders of the modern metropolis – one feature that’s recognizable across almost every film made by Horn – crossfade and overtake the screen. CHROMA received a special award of merit from the Academy of Motion Picture arts and Sciences; on his CV, Horn described the film like this: “real images are manipulated through special effects and printing to create an artificial dreamscape.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2DsiNiZuzUSSXvtJi1POk1P3wXq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chroma","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
