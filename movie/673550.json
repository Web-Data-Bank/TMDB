It was shot in a single day and lit by Carol Mullins (wife of Jim Neu, who would write DOOMED LOVE and THE BIG BLUE). The introductory text describes the dance as “relying on each individual dancer’s energies and response to the ropes. The ‘choreograph’ for this dance is the geometry of the ropes, the centrifugal force of the spinning from and the strict revolving patterns of solo and chorus.” The music for ROPE DANCE TRANSLATIONS was composed by Michael Galasso, who would go on to provide unforgettable string compositions for Wong Kar-Wai’s IN THE MOOD FOR LOVE.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9wLf4tDPaEj2VKfuYBpMjR3QL7E.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rope Dance Translations","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
