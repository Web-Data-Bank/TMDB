His untimely death in unclear circumstances, which have opened several judicial inquiries, was a shock to the world of cycling, which lost its Pirate on Valentine's Day. The film is a tribute to this Italian sporting hero, remembering him as a young man who, riding his bike, reached several milestones but was defeated in a fatal match.","popularity":2.048,"poster_path":"/kSdXgHudzD1dqAQX2wHTPwPZhBB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":139911,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mr. Arkadin Film","origin_country":""},{"id":141573,"logo_path":null,"name":"Emilia-Romagna Film Commission","origin_country":""},{"id":141574,"logo_path":null,"name":"Unipol Banca","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2020-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Il caso Pantani - L'omicidio di un campione","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":23}
