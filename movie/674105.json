Under the pressure of a family ultimatum, he travels to Cuba in order to give himself a second chance. There, he meets Emma, a feminist writer from London who is writing an essay on Cuban machismo. Due to the differences in the language, he thinks she is a script writer and so he decides to lead her to believe he is Cuban in order to capture her interest in a desperate attempt to rescue his pitiful career. She believes him and sticks to him, since her last book did not sell the way she expected. She needs a new work which may rocket her back to the top where she once was. Cuauhtémoc goes trough hell since he has not one gram of Cuban in him; actually he is more a tourist than she is, since Emma has been to Habana many times. She writes an encyclopedic work about a Cuban who is really Mexican, and he plays the best role of his life for a tiny little opportunity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tTxZhaMarbfbgQrG5tdJla6jrYa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2021-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Habanero","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
