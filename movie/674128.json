Meanwhile, his mundane everyday life back in his isolated hut surrounded by fish pond waters is beset with a horrifying secret about him being physically abused by his wife, beating him to a pulp and sometimes degrades him verbally with no remorse constantly about women being linked to him. Lori, the wife, is set to leave for abroad as a domestic helper. She harbors ill feelings against Lando whom she caught meeting with his ex-girlfriend in a rendezvous.
