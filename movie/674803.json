The colors shift from the normal to their complements, producing extraordinary after-images, and this is done to a pulse by means of over 3000 splices to the films. The sound is from a tape recording of the Ray Gun Specs at the Judson Church in 1960, and in which Higgins was one of the featured Happenings artists. â€“D.
