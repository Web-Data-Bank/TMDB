Two very different homes. In one, a father watches sports lying on the sofa, expecting the son to do the same. In another apartment, a wealthy-looking mother sits at the table to dine with her daughter, completely different from her. At the same time, the boy and the girl embark on a nocturnal adventure of transformation, during which they strip off the various stratifications of gender that they have inherited. The streets of the city are transformed into a liberating walkway. When by chance they meet – face to face, body to body – they mirror each other in silence, offering comfort, safety.","popularity":1.25,"poster_path":"/3nG2JuF8XCk3Od6U3SZyA0TIi9Z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18193,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hi!
