Anthony Richards (Roberts) – you know, the Anthony Richards, The Actor – is depressed. His agent (Dolly Wells) has just dropped him, he’s unemployed, and he has little choice but to go home for Christmas - home to his doting mother, his jealous brother and a claustrophobic Welsh community that still reveres him as the home town boy who made it big. Back in his childhood home Anthony has demons to confront. But when Patricia (Erin Richards), the Head of Drama at the area’s most prestigious stage school, presents Ant with an offer to write and direct a play, Anthony finally has the chance to leave his Christmas Kid’s baggage in the past, once and for all.","popularity":1.578,"poster_path":"/jIl2FSK5P1LHrQhIBBEvdVMmJgn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4043,"logo_path":null,"name":"Red Union Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Return of the Yuletide Kid","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3}
