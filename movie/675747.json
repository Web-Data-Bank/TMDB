While these scandals may have promoted attendance at its opening, audiences will really respond the most to the songs in this film, everything from \"St. Louis Blues\" to \"Tipi-Tipi-Tin.\" The songs outweigh the plot itself, and do much to alleviate the otherwise weak storyline.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7RJLdt4cBVaNwZVTToohirsyAZA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"1960-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Una canción para recordar","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
