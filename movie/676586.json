A magician botches his trick of sawing a woman in half, and loses his assistant’s legs. An overequipped hiker gets stuck in the elevator for several days. An old man falls in love with a runaway pair of legs. A mother asks her neighbour to look after her children on the eve of Saint-Festin… In one building, the lives of ten next-door neighbours, or the neighbours of neighbours, intertwine as they grapple with the dramas, joys, surprises and dangers of everyday life.","popularity":1.044,"poster_path":"/d1cMcf6irctcBVB3kf06NXX5Zm8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72654,"logo_path":"/qAGfpZE53RKgPWyiWYnIUdzpPrb.png","name":"Lardux films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":87330,"logo_path":"/q9d6ayg63uCivzLuw7HCODaWdf.png","name":"Marmitafilms","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Neighbours of My Neighbours are Neighbours of Mine","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":4}
