She survives of food stolen from the castle of the sinister Regent Tristain. One day, to escape his guards, Pil disguises herself as a princess. Thus she embarks upon a mad, delirious adventure, together with Crobar, a big clumsy guard who thinks she's a noble, and Rigolin, a young crackpot jester. Pil is going to have to save Roland, rightful heir to the throne under the curse of a spell. This adventure will turn the entire kingdom upside down, and teach Pil that nobility can be found in all of us.","popularity":29.723,"poster_path":"/abPQVYyNfVuGoFUfGVhlNecu0QG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28792,"logo_path":null,"name":"TAT Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":2902,"logo_path":"/vFmmYSgFp8eE6C34JVCXy9bJFmc.png","name":"SND","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":591,"logo_path":"/q5I5RDwMEiqoNmfaJgd2LraEOJY.png","name":"France 3 Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-08-11","revenue":6813652,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pil's Adventures","video":false,"vote_average":6.712,"vote_count":153}
