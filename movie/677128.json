It's a particularly cinematic walk in many ways. Gary investigates the way a single film stock responds so diversely to different seasons, light, weather, time of day. He also beautifully exploits the power of editing to compose or recompose events. Shot spatially out of order over the course of a year, Gary recomposed the footage in editing to make it proceed consistently forward in space, resulting in an intricate mixing up of chronology, so some cuts could represent a jump of months either forward or backward in time. The result is one of gauzy impressionism brought into vivid and breathtaking clarity.\" Mark Toscano via Canyon Cinema","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2kq0Y2PChIK2P0m3scCuZWV2r2h.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Venice Pier","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
