While Gógó is continuously getting herself into trouble, of the kind only a person with Alzheimer can, the son, the director, is struggling with financial troubles after his film Children of Nature has flopped in the cinema. As Gógó‘s disease progresses her family decides that it is best for her to move to a nursing home. Gógó and her deceased husband, who appears on the scene, are not happy with that decision.
