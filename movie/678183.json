The Wizard decides to bring them all to Oz, transforming them into Oz celebrities: Tippetarius, the Scarecrow, Nick Chopper, Tik-Tok, Old Mombi, Jinjur, Scraps, The Shaggy Man, Betsy Bobbin, and Jack Pumpkinhead. After a party and registration, it's on to class with Professor Wogglebug. When Tip and Jack carry him out of the classroom, he subjects them to a blue book exam, after which they wish to return to the U of M. The equivalent characters are not played by the same people, so there transformation, their \"true self\" appears behind them in the early scenes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gAIqZwYVRtyjKrF9BbkpzYvvz0m.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129809,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Freshmen Women","origin_country":""},{"id":129810,"logo_path":null,"name":"The University of Michigan League","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1936-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oz University","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
