Filmmaker Marshall Woodworth recounts his childhood when boucheries, cochon de lait, and Creole French were a more dominant cultural force, contrasting that against the dearth of fluent French speakers in Louisiana today. Along the way, Woodworth interviews a rich range of elders, French Immersion instructors, sociologists, and—potentially the key to Creole French’s future—musicians.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Veille","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
