Benjamin admired it and described it in detail in his essay “Theses on the Philosophy of History.” The picture portrays a restless angel who tasted reality. For a moment the angel freezes as if observing the inevitable turns of history. German director Eric Esser filmed at the Spanish-French border, which used to be a place of smuggling routes. It is across this border Walter Benjamin once escaped from the Nazis too.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vCXxEig0rR2dAmlyDIy1CSGhgKw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":132868,"logo_path":null,"name":"MakeShiftMovies","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Angel of History","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
