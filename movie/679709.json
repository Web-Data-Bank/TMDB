It is a story about dual nature of kings and things and how playing cards came to be. One half of the King represents a barbaric King, a crude but fearless warrior. The other half of his is a King-poet, a man of graceful poise and manners. They share their conscience, but have opposing wishes and desperately want to get rid of each other.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nRAV8YL2aRJYZBUK4B5tKqogHV6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129936,"logo_path":null,"name":"To Blink Studio","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":129937,"logo_path":null,"name":"PLAN 9","origin_country":"UA"},{"id":83882,"logo_path":null,"name":"AZT-Media","origin_country":""},{"id":129938,"logo_path":null,"name":"DAT Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":24726,"logo_path":null,"name":"Canada Council for the Arts","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":129939,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Centre of Serbia","origin_country":""},{"id":129941,"logo_path":null,"name":"Toronto Arts Council","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":129942,"logo_path":null,"name":"European Short Pitch","origin_country":""},{"id":24725,"logo_path":"/1HhNIJjQO2enpg76YNryXBWribp.png","name":"Ontario Arts Council","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"}],"release_date":"2017-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Twice Upon a Time","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
