An Architecture freak, unloved and uncared for, it sails high above the comforting provinciality of Novgorod the Great. Erected during the final years of Soviet Rule, this remarkable example of modernist architecture has, for many decades,continued to mock the ancient heritage of the city, as well as the mediocre tastes of its populace. The story of theater's uneasy survival, it's persistent inability to fit into the Novgorod's surroundings, and its slow but sure demise at the hands of greedy bureaucrats become a direct metaphor for the Russian society today.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/g8pvfeBbqpbTh4vBIlxXxQfNQNc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129998,"logo_path":null,"name":"Elephant Grass Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The story of the Dostoevsky Drama Theater's building, an unwelcome alien in the provincial and narrow-minded town of Novgorod, shines light into the darkest corners of the new Russian capitalism, exposing the corruption of country's political system.","title":"The Novgorod Spaceship","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
