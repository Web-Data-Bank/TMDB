Through the intimate portrait of four unique 'cat ladies' we create a sensitive and emotionally honest portrait of women whose lives and self-worth have become intractably linked to cats. It's not the number of cats that defines someone as a 'cat lady', but rather their attachment, or non-attachment, to human beings. They create a world with their cats in which they are accepted and in control - a world where they ultimately have value.","popularity":1.038,"poster_path":"/mywbUEOP0VgOfNnOmRsPDjKgC6d.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128032,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chocolate Box Entertainment","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2009-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"When cats mean \"meow\" to you than people.","title":"Cat Ladies","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":3}
