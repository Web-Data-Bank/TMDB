This colourful, beautifully sung performance features legendary Czech soprano Lucia Popp and German tenor Siegfried Jerusalem.  Filmed live at the Wiener Staatsoper in 1982, the appearance of the townsfolk, wearing their traditional Bohemian costumes, exuberantly singing and dancing, serves to quickly draw us into the early 1870s and this engaging comedy of love nearly thwarted but ultimately triumphant.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2tEJR34B9bFVAg8zhtRFHy4eDjX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":155,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Smetana: The Bartered Bride (Wiener Staatsoper)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
