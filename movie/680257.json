In the small village of Vrontados on the Greek island of Chios, there is unrest. For over a century, parishioners of two Greek Orthodox churches have engaged in a battle on Holy Saturday, firing more than 100,000 homemade rockets at each otherâ€™s churches once the sun goes down.  Its origin is unclear. One theory holds that churches on the island faked a civil war during the Turkish occupation so they could celebrate Easter without being plagued by war. Accordingly the ruse worked, as the Turks kept a safe distance, allowing the villagers to attend Easter Mass.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":130051,"logo_path":null,"name":"Variable","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-06-29","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rocket Wars","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
