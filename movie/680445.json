Among the five directors are three debutants who were chosen to film their stories after winning a scenario contest. The final result is a sympathetic collection of films that remain small and simple: the puppy love between a boy and a girl on their winter trip to school, the memories of a young woman about her mother's response to her first menstruation and bra, and the story of a student who returns to his village, but all too soon flees again for the past that is waiting for him there.  The stories take place strikingly often around the cemetery and look at things from the past being revealed. The last contribution to the omnibus film is also significantly called ‘a small truth’.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/m1ftDzAXp0vWuPJMvBlnOVWxDlN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tales from Kars","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
