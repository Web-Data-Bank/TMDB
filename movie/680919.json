Through repetition of this approach, the movement and the framing become a sensual force —and the objects appear in all their voluptuousness. Gerson has employed this technique repeatedly. In his Translucent Appearances (1975), thirty-five different shots of Niagara Falls are blocked by horizontal, monochromatic mattes. The object is shaped —water flowing seeking a form that will suffice. These are films that disclose gradually, changing revealed and unrevealed layers of visual information.\" Mónica Savirón","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4IFP61wOCl9fnfE3F3GDx3kHJRU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Translucent Appearances","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
