Only when he permits us to enter into the fantastic area of the cinema! He is the lonely hermit in his kingdom. They reveal him and he is revealed. The film projectionist, the unknown hero of cinema. As none knows him and perhaps he knows nothing about himself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2he1uINoAAL6TDRjGvZ78J05tLc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Nobody Looks Beyond the Shadow","title":"Heroes of the Flicks","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
