The impact from the crash paralyzed Alex―and medically speaking, it was unlikely that he could survive. “I think that Alex has gone to be with Jesus,” a friend told the stricken dad. But two months later, Alex awoke from a coma with an incredible story to share. Of events at the accident scene and in the hospital while he was unconscious. Of the angels who took him through the gates of heaven itself. Of the unearthly music that sounded just terrible to a six-year-old. And most amazing of all . . . of meeting and talking to Jesus.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aCNdiXExgj3vOLXspKEqpWoM0V9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Boy Who Came Back From Heaven","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
