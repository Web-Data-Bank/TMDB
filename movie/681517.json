Recordings of the original choral versions can be found on Phoenix Chorale's 2012 album, Northern Lights (Chandos Records).  Producer Morten Lindberg suggested recording a few tracks where I would play layers of two or three pianos, which I thought was a great way to really exploit the surround sound potential on a solo album. We moved the piano between each take, eventually constituting a triangle, and the listener is sitting in the middle in a surround system setup.  As a pianist, improvisation is where my heart is. With this recording I wanted to express and share my passion for that art form.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/i1T6M4cSUApoQh0ERAKSapCLb1w.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ola Gjeilo - PIANO IMPROVISATIONS","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
