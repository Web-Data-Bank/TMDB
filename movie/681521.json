The composers represented here have often chosen to allow their music to evolve in stable structures and remain within static harmonic spaces even when the music becomes expressive and dramatic: Benjamin Britten, Francis Poulenc, Maurice Duruflé, Eric Whitacre, Morten Lauridsen, Martin Ødegaard, Kjell Mørk Karlsen, Anton Bruckner, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Arvo Pärt, Ola Gjeilo, Andrew Smith and Trond Kverno.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/w9UsyQhFTpUYCcdHrS70xsdO0Ts.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hymn to the Virgin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
