In their latest album SONG they embrace the whole spectrum, from the softly delicate to the massively unsettling. In words and music each track has a story to tell about man and his relationship with nature, his fellow man and to God. The listener is rewarded with an almost visceral experience of the unaccompanied human voice – breathing and pulsing, direct and unfiltered.  The compositions present nature in all its variation, sensitively evoking the different times of the day, both lyrically and musically: Marianne Reidarsdatter Eriksen, Geirr Tveitt, Håkon Berge, Sven Erik Bäck, Alfred Janson, Bo Holten, Torbjørn Dyrud, Harald Gullichsen, Jaakko Mäntyjärvi and Carl Nielsen.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tVqml1Pa3I1NgVADq55ai8aC7tu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"SONG - Uranienborg","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
