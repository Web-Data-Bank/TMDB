Gehr sat there from one day from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 or 5:00 p.m. and shot it with his Bolex camera, one frame at a time. It conveys the settled relief of being home, as against the pace of the monochromatic working day seen in the three prior films. It is closer to his earlier films in its abstraction of forms and play with time-lapse and film speed. In the beginning, the forms are screamingly reddish-orange and incomprehensible, but as the afternoon progresses shadows slip across the surfaces and windows, fire escapes, and bricks become visible: a world is revealed with the clarity of Vermeerâ€™s famed Little Street (1657-8).\" - Jason Rosenfeld","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/m1efKodL4nePZVRnz2n6E8e9a58.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-08","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Greene Street","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
