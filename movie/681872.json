It is populated by many delicate endemic species. Sometimes called a \"glass\" ecosystem, here you can see the brightest stars fill the sky. It is an ancient area of the South Island where land use is severely restricted. Looking further into the Bonin Blue Sea, you will find beautiful lively fish dancing in the water, where coral reefs, sunken boats, and migrating dolphins can be observed. A highlight to see in this area is the great power of humpback whale families appearing to raise their young for winter. The nature of Ogasawara Chichijima and its surroundings was wonderfully captured dynamically from the sky, land, and sea, simply a beauty to behold. Info: The Bonin Islands are an archipelago of over 30 islands, 1,000 kilometres directly south of Tokyo, Japan. The name comes from the word bunin, meaning \"no people\".","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qNq1JZTyZYcLs0kBUppPDBpGXz8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":130306,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vicom","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2018-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A southern paradise in Bonin Blue","title":"World Natural Heritage Ogasawara - The Sea of Bonin","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
