It was released in DVD format on the Warner Brothers label on March 9, 2004. This concert is perhaps most notable for a performance of the song \"Country Feedback\", which Michael Stipe opens by declaring it his \"favorite song\". The rendition features appended lyrics from another song, Reveal's \"Chorus and the Ring\", and a guitar solo by Peter Buck, neither of which are in the original. Other concert highlights include the appearance of two then-new songs, \"Bad Day\" (Also originally known as PSA when first written in the early 1980's) and \"Animal\", and the re-emergence of the long-lost song \"Permanent Vacation\". \"Permanent Vacation\" dates back to 1980, years before their first album, while \"Bad Day\" dates back to 1985.","popularity":1.691,"poster_path":"/g68zWROAI89XoosVLpwaweykLy8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":51127,"logo_path":null,"name":"Warner Vision Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":12870,"logo_path":null,"name":"Scarlet Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":143,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"R.E.M. performing 23 songs in Wiesbaden, Germany, on 2003-07-19.","title":"R.E.M. : Perfect Square","video":false,"vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":5}
