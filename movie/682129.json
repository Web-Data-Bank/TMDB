It is a synthesis of Finland’s Bold and the Beautiful – of a time when the swing of the haystack band made the public wild. Passion, jealousy, lust and forgiveness meet in the surges of the rapids and at the gates of heaven.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3qxgbLAHVPFDMr3FzAnBGfE0YNv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17644,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jörn Donner Productions","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"1997-08-23","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Between the Fist and the Stove","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":1}
