They started fighting back, creating a movement to force changes in their workplaces. This movement became national, and is a largely forgotten story of U.S. twentieth century history. It encapsulates a unique intersection of the women’s movement with the labor movement. The awareness these secretaries brought to bear on women’s work reverberates even today. Clericals were the low-wage workers of their era. America now confronts the growing reality of deep income inequality. The stories and strategies of these bold, creative women resonates in contemporary America.","popularity":1.985,"poster_path":"/jlUkadjnMy35BOcilv5lvOszLCV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75170,"logo_path":"/AiDruPS1BWcXNke9nuS4qxq9vHh.png","name":"Chicken \u0026 Egg Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":85095,"logo_path":null,"name":"Independent Lens","origin_country":"US"},{"id":100712,"logo_path":null,"name":"National Endowment For The Arts","origin_country":""},{"id":13045,"logo_path":"/mBR20RYepv3OrKF7OJYu5EYUt2y.png","name":"Fork Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"9to5: The Story of a Movement","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":6}
