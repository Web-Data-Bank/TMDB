A study of a young man, Lee Fan Bao, through the vicissitudes of his grandfather in Seoul, his own in London and those of his boyfriend in Hong Kong. Trains Bound for the Sea aims to convey a sense of place, but also a sense of time, as we see its characters dwarfed by history. Love and loss, time and place, a sensual downplayed melodrama.","popularity":0.608,"poster_path":"/kuNY0fVzdC2WwMNWMy3fuzEvuBg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-08-22","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trains Bound for the Sea","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
