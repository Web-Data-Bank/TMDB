They had the audacious idea to build a studio in their farmhouse. Animals were kicked out of barns and musicians moved into Nan’s spare bedroom. Inadvertently, they’d launched the world’s first independent residential recording studio: Rockfield. Black Sabbath, Queen, Robert Plant, Iggy Pop, Simple Minds, The Stone Roses, Oasis, Coldplay and more made music and mayhem at Rockfield over the decades. This is their story of rock and roll dreams intertwined with a family business’s fight for survival in the face of an ever-changing music landscape.","popularity":2.423,"poster_path":"/w0sUa7ic6uI41heeWeWM93WDFCz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rockfield : The Studio on the Farm","video":false,"vote_average":7.636,"vote_count":11}
