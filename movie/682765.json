Wonderfully structured, “Hot Pink Horror” takes the audience through why this story was selected, how Stanley became director, how Cage became involved, why they shot the film in Sintra, Portugal, and much more. Even though 20 minutes doesn’t seem like much, Govaerts packs such a great deal of details on production, both creative and technical, that it’s almost a bit like a mini film school. If you really dug Color Out of Space, this is the piece to dive into and enjoy.","popularity":2.082,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hot Pink Horror: The Making of Color Out of Space","video":true,"vote_average":8.3,"vote_count":3}
