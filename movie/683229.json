There is no reality, only an indistinguishable mixture of images and moments drawn from some space in time that could be his past, his present, or his future.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rEO3pwVzPzXDJS5uYPqsa1lhQ67.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Winter There Was Very Little Snow","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
