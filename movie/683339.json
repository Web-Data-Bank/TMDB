In a brazen move, Chevron spent more than $3 million to back 83-year-old African American stalwart Nat Bates. Bates makes a Faustian bargain with the city's corporate behemoth in a cagey attempt to preserve the long-standing but waning power of Richmond's African-American working class community, whose rich history dates back to the formation of the Kaiser shipyards during World War Two.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dakoW3RfLfAXkkta0au3ybGYUOt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nat Bates For Mayor","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
