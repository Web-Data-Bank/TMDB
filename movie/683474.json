This film reveals the true story behind both of these deaths, creating an evocation of a man who had remarkable gifts - and had to bear great personal tragedy. Combining touching dramatizations of three of Kipling's most important works with distinguished contributions from his leading biographers, this is a truly remarkable portrait of one of the world's greatest writers. In Kipling's bedroom at his house Bateman's to this day are his son's cricket bat and his daughter's portrait.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/w487oEAqHgqcpa2Afzw7vXBJxTF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131704,"logo_path":null,"name":"Odyssey Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rudyard Kipling A Secret Life","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
