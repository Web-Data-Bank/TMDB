The steles change slowly, the field opens up, the planes of color shift imperceptibly and re-divide, forming different combinations that then, without interruptions or cuts, break up and enter into new figurations. The title does not refer to an appearance, it seems as if the \"slope\" or \"bias\" were only a self-reference.
