In Mrs. Smith's enrichment class they put away textbooks and learn to question the ordinary, take risks and solve problems themselves. With no interviews or commentary over a seven-month arc, it's a chance to observe the emerging personalities and natural drama of eight 10-year-olds. It's a heartfelt fifth-grade experience of creativity, frustration, hilarity and triumph.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sitting Machine","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
