Inspired by the emotional experience of growing up in a country in transition, Standing in the Sun is an alternative narrative. It is a coming of age story, focusing on a group of boys living in suburban Skopje, Macedonia. Both the group of boys' and the nation’s state of transition are explored through the boys’ perspective; where masculinity and national pride are highly celebrated and appreciated. With my childhood friends and family as participants in all stages of production, we explore relations between I as the director and them as outsiders of the art world. With our nation as our backdrop, we reimagine the present by revisiting the past. As a result, through this body of work, I investigate dynamics between our cultural identity and surroundings in Macedonia.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nBLhXLsHFJPTKRXwK4huoQC8QVY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"We stayed out late... until we started to read each other’s minds, be in each other’s minds.
