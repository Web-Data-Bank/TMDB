When he meets up with his friends or goes hunting with them, it is often with the aim of evoking together their memories of the civil war fought in the Christian militia. They live in nostalgia for the war that impassioned their youth. Director Myriam El Hajj builds solid architectural images that interrogate — and, perhaps, over time even manage to articulate — the intimate origins of violence that never seems to depart and a past that doesn't want to let go of the present.","popularity":1.095,"poster_path":"/iY2wUwTpcXECkgjyYXz7i7dvi1w.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2567,"logo_path":"/wia94WcCrJC8SXxTcEqeqQS66Hk.png","name":"Abbout Productions","origin_country":"LB"},{"id":102822,"logo_path":null,"name":"Inthemood","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"}],"release_date":"2015-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Time To Rest","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
