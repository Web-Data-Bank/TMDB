Free GPS tracks, travel resources, and the waterproof Butler Motorcycle Map will be available on RideBDR.com on February 1.  The film features eight-time AMA National Enduro Champion Mike Lafferty of KTM, and international ADV celebrity and BMW International GS Trophy team member, Jocelin Snow, along with BDR board members. Taking a first run on the NEBDR, the team tests their endurance and skills on an epic 1,400-mile backcountry tour of the Northeast region up to the Canadian border. The route meanders through seven states and nearly a dozen state forests on rustic dirt and gravel roads, challenging seasonal and class 4 roads, and twisty tarmac.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/AlV7o1re4xZyPPEaOvaJv1pugnj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Northeast BDR","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
