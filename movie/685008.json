As the pastry approaches, the character's tongue begins to swell disproportionately; devouring it is impossible. The work oscillates between trivial humor and studied nonchalance. The video responds to James Williamson's film The Big Swallow (1901) where a man undertakes to swallow the camera. It also refers to the erotic-burlesque videos of Paul McCarthy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xbT1FWkmAuVMFUm7zdXXLCIfzVk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Religieuse au chocolat","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
