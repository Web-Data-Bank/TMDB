Cold winds. Death pulse. Dancing and eating, with penguins and tortured humans screaming in the abyss of death. Every year they travel to the coast with the intention of dancing and then die. All over the world, there's more than meets the eye. Land and sea to share. Red, yellow, black and white. There's darkness and there's light. Sad stories are told, but it's good to be alive.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3ijFpiStOsKmjPEFhXGYbhI8ZBY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2019-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lieder die Soldaten Morgen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
