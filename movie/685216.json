They use each other as a form of connection between their previous ways of thinking and doing and what they hope to be their new ways of thinking and doing. 'Scattered Explorations' is about the time between; the analysis of a pending revolution.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jfTOCfhelMGUV5tcNSP5ul6VEZc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Scattered Explorations","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
