Not the chronological 1960s, but the electric, turbulent decade of rock, revolution, and the Vietnam War.  The Dominoes Movie focuses on a succession of thirteen evolutionary tableaus, conveying the directorâ€™s view that one thing leads to another, as in the domino effect where one change or event causes a similar one, which then causes an additional one, and so on in a linear sequence. A portrait of the Vietnam War decade without narration and presented entirely via news footage and a soundtrack featuring BB King, Marvin Gaye, The Rolling Stones, Grateful Dead, Janis Joplin, Santana, Neil Young, CSN&Y, Van Morrison, The Incredible String Band, Canned Heat and David Peel.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mGIHVr6rXDxy20dDc0ZRNLjGQYL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":130942,"logo_path":null,"name":"Red Dawn Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"An Uncensored Journey Through the Sixties","title":"Dominoes: An Uncensored Journey Through the Sixties","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":2}
