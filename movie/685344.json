The film careens through six unpredictable weeks in the lives of a group of street-kids, as they learn to make films in a video workshop. The streetwise subjects, ranging in age from 17 to 23 years old, are a challenging class: sometimes they donâ€™t show up at all, and one has to be bailed out of jail.  But they have a passion to create and tell stories. As they work at documenting their experiences on videotape, we discover their world and hidden dreams.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Longshots","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
