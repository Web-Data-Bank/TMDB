Her jealous sisters and the old Aunt Barbaricha cannot bear this situation to persist and by trickery see to it that the Tsaritsa and her newborn son Gvidon are thrown into the sea. In their barrel they are washed ashore on an enchanted island where the rapidly growing tsar’s son saves a swan from the clutches of a wizard. In gratitude, the swan helps Gvidon to visit his native country once again in the guise of a bumblebee. Three wishes, three miracles and three bee-stings later, father and son are finally able to get to know each other.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uzyh6PEG8lydNRaZ1krhwXN7int.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82718,"logo_path":null,"name":"De Munt / La Monnaie","origin_country":""},{"id":71999,"logo_path":null,"name":"Teatro Real de Madrid","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2019-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":157,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Tale Of Tsar Saltan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
