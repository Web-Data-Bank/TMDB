It doesn't matter if, inside the box, the cat is alive, dead or undead. It is a paradox. Still, a film about a Portuguese rock band can begin with an introduction to quantum physics, when some of these basic concepts are used as a starting point for the creative process. The director Ricardo Oliveira recorded the daydreams of recording the third album of originals by Capitão Fausto: Capitão Fausto Têm os Dias Contados. And when in one of the songs - “Corazón” - is heard at a certain point: “… Pontas soltas. Isso é comigo. E por isso queres também ser assim. Pontas soltas. Isso é comigo. Para estragar um disco tenho-me a mim…”, it is clear that the band of Tomás Wallenstein, Manuel Palha, Francisco Ferreira, Domingos Coimbra and Salvador Seabra reached the age of majority and tied such loose ends. More than a diary, it is an experience.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fjBK8sHhVUGmvFFSnGBBnYf3qZr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2016-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Loose Ends","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
