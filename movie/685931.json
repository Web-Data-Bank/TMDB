What follows is a short, Hugh Jackman-centric look at the film's production, focusing on the character of Wolverine. The film's stunt coordinator discusses Jackman's commitment to bulking up-drinking a dozen egg whites a day and going on an intense fitness regime-and director Gavin Hood explains Wolverine's degree of self-loathing about his own nature. We also see some of the design work that went into the film, including the sculpting of young Logan's bone claws and the re-invention of the adamantium tank. Jackman comes off personable as always, and it's clear that he really loves this role.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xTfTwH4jEiPsbTSjfDsY8eS3zV0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wolverine Unleashed: The Complete Origins","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":3}
