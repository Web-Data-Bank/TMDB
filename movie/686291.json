It is clear from the way they look at each other that there is extraordinary chemistry between these two boys. Exam time is coming, and Rudy is studying intensively at home. Of course, Jacob has completely different thoughts in his head. Thomas is waiting for his friend Benjamin at the airport, and in a while they will both be in bed together. Thomas, who lacks experience, looks around in the fitness center and tries to figure out where and how to begin exercising. Cory, a regular and experienced visitor to the fitness center and at that moment also the only person in the fitness center, watches Thomas and willingly helps him with exercising. Jan is returning home and in front of his building meets a boy who is carrying a lot of bags. He is the kind of boy that Jan always wanted to meet, and as of today he is his new roommate!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/319MdMFNk0p1KCQroFkzKVnnuFj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126582,"logo_path":"/zIDtCugieAcKbL3LrxRrR6vWbXS.png","name":"Ayor Studios","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2013-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Part two of the popular series NEIGHBOURS is here!","title":"Neighbours Two","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
