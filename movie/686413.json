Four free trade zones in four different Turkish cities. Surrounded by high walls, barbed wire fences, very much like a concentration camp. This documentary covers the working conditions of women in the free trade zones, their experiences, observations and their hopes for the future. The barbed wire fences not only sorround the zones but also accentuate the captivity of women, of women workers. So much so that the borders of the zone evade us, inside and outside is indistinguishable.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lj3GdooqVnSXTPEuy31KQ0CUEnz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Zone","title":"Bölge","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
