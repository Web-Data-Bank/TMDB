It’s summertime, the month of August, in Vascões, North of Portugal. Many of the houses of emigrants, empty during the rest of the year, are once more inhabited. We visit six of them, guided by the stories of those who built them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/f1SotUTdF32tVRLlHlzy9ffg2SG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9047,"logo_path":"/a0oCybecb96ieZY4139hb9uqYs1.png","name":"Terratreme","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The House I Want","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
