Knutsen (Syntax TerrOrkester) and a concept developed by producer Simeon Frohm. Four directors have each been given a visual image of an audio file, as well as a title and length limitation as a starting point to create each chapter of the film. None of the directors have heard the sound, this has been mixed and completed based on raw versions of the film chapters. Common to the chapters is that they deal with the term \"Garden\" and its associated chapter title. The landscape of Utsira, where the film was filmed, lays the foundation for aesthetics.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iCJrlmHQqPDe6SC1RlTuIVPaa8t.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2018-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Future illusions from a deserted island","title":"Garden II","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
