Dexter begins to mentally replace his deceased wife and child with Dr. Miller and her daughter. Finding out that Dr. Miller has a husband, Kevin Miller, infuriates Dexter and sets him on a path of destruction. Kidnapping and brutally murdering Raymond Tucker, his family's killer, he continues on this hunt and kidnaps Kevin.
