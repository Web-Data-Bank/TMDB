Two years later a newlywed couple moves into this house and they start to experience some supernatural occurrences from the very first day, but the couple also believes there are not alone in this house. A year later an alcoholic writer moves into this house to begin an investigation about the disappearance of his daughter that coincidently happened to be around the same time Mark and his entire family were murder.
