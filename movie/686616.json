The short works link thematically in their investigations into human-vehicle relationships. Whether performing instructional poetry in the garage, documenting the interiors of strangersâ€™ cars, or celebrating art world connections to the road, the work balances a playful humor with a critical eye on where society is currently parked.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/qfMrteAdcLno6khiloArEfm3fw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Emotions in Metal","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
