Or if he should even become one. A shojo (young girl) gives birth, despite never having given motherhood a thought. Indifferent, she leaves her breasts behind, forcing her son to fend for himself. Desiring love, the man-boy sets out in the sampled city to find his mother, who gives him an icy-cold greeting before self-destructing. These are the experiences of fear, desire and loneliness of young people in Japan. This is their Tokyo Story.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/c2LevzfBtPvGi9visBQ65tocYB2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-03-28","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tokyo Story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
