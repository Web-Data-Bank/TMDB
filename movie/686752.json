Her father, the highly conservative mullah, is a radical supporter of the Iranian clergy, but is himself fighting to control his defiant children with their conflicting attitudes and religious beliefs. At the same time, Mahdieh is struggling to keep a secret: she is planning the escape from the country with her boyfriend. But as time goes by, the family situation grows even more complicated.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sKzSXrZe4vCUUPGSvKraokCaiC7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25603,"logo_path":null,"name":"TFC Trickompany Filmproduktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mullah's Daughter","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
