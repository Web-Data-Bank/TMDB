At least that's what the young men in 'Silence and Swords' imagine the boyhood they feel were cheated out of. They are transgender, and now, as adults, they have decided to explore male identity formation in Northern Europe's last wilderness. They have brought along a tent, gas fires and a slightly too clichéd list of all the things they need to experience on an educational journey that turns out to put their loving friendship to the test -- and forces them into a modern existential battle in the middle of the nature they have otherwise always felt betrayed by.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/foS5VlcKEKofv2ImPfPpRAtmUnr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silence and Swords","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
