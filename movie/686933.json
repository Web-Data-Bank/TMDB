The cross-media work 'Mother's Tongue' is a collaboration between artist Lap-See Lam and filmmaker Wingyee Wu. The film version is created with a spatial scanner that has produced the three-dimensional architectural animations which a weightless camera floats around in, while we in three short episodes listen to the personal stories about language, identity and life as a Chinese person in Sweden.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mother’s Tongue","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
