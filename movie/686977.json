Prelle challenges the norms and is used to doing what she wants. But at the same time, she is caught between her own dreams, the expectations of the outside world and harsh realities. The debut director Anita Beikpour has therefore mixed the forms to be able to draw a full portrait of the young rapper and nonconformist. Music video, fiction and raw realism go side by side in a cinematic tale of a rebel's internal and external struggles.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7M2rHeHrLcqCefuNIHN7AL3FUX2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Prelle - In My Own Voice","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
