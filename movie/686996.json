Her most recent work is a portrait, and a new variation on her method. Before the camera, we encounter the formidable 87 year-old artist Margaret Rasp√© who works in photography, film, drawing and other art forms. Regardless of the medium, automatisms play a significant role in her art. Nissen transcends the traditional limits of the portrait genre and has created a congenial and loving tribute to a unique creative mind.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1RQcLK5MLi65AegjLSHe2uMRub3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2020-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"There Is","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
