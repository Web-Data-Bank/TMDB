He is trying to sell the coconuts he has picked to the tourists to make a living, while dreaming of meeting a woman who can help him to a better future. She is a tourist in a foreign country - and she is a filmmaker. 'Low Season' describes an unequal and problemtic encounter, but does so in a form based on exchange and mutual trust, which the dreamy, fragmented film not only reflects but enters into a direct dialoge with. 'Low Season' is hopefully a promise of longer films to come from Mie Mollerup who has made her mark with an artistic and humane vision in a both compact and complex form.","popularity":0.855,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-03-20","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Low Season","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
