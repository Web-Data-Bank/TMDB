The set includes quintessential hits about loving and letting go from the seven-time Grammy winner's days as a confessional rock phenomenon. The singer/songwriter also introduces fans to her latest and most adventurous album, So-Called Chaos. The honest, unadulterated performance reflects Morissette's move away from her days as a rancorous 90's rocker, and into the mode of a mature musician ready to experiment with her strengths. Morissette's enduring introspection, continual evolution, and evocative stage presence shine in this Soundstage performance.","popularity":0.841,"poster_path":"/kxhIWhlzq7xpdiCBfFaWz6KIxx7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alanis Morissette: Live at Soundstage","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
