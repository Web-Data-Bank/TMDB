It deals with the phenomenon of magic and superstition in very innovative and interesting way. In his natural environment Leo Gershman introduces us to all the secrets of white magic and elements used for making and removing the spells. On the other hand, the film shows a completely new, intimate and undiscovered side of a man - the ideological and moral immigrant, circus performer and entertainer. The film reveals the position of the common man in modern Serbia, his aspirations and the need for security, faith and unraveling the unknown. Throughout the film examines the role of the totalitarian regime in the creation and nurturing of such social phenomena, with emphasis on the Soviet and Yugoslav model of totalitarianism. This is a story of supreme manipulator, a man who knows human nature to perfection, who associates with the otherworldly forces, and use them to help others to find their own peace.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dPD7paFwFzuPBayrVqHnOXJ2Wsn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73656,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mandragora Film","origin_country":"RS"},{"id":107698,"logo_path":null,"name":"Luksuz produkcija","origin_country":"SI"},{"id":131271,"logo_path":null,"name":"KUD Pozitiv","origin_country":"RS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"},{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"2014-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Leo from the Other World","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
