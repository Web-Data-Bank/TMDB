So he follows in the footsteps of Eik Skal√∏e, the lead singer of Steppeulvene, who committed suicide in India in 1968. And he would like to do so all the way. Luxury-loving Mikkel is not so wild about Johan's wild life experiments, but nonetheless joins him on the trip, which takes the two Danes across a magical, wild and unpredictable India. A crazy trip, reserved for those who are out of their minds.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hZ7AgHxBCyz0DRgL1y9w6sgJzSw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131279,"logo_path":null,"name":"Framework Films","origin_country":""},{"id":235,"logo_path":"/obOynoztBEhDNfHsDXBqOuQLAZk.png","name":"Nordisk Film Denmark","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2011-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Road to Paradise","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
