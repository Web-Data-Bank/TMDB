David Bamberger broke ground on the first ever man-made bat cave. Bamberger, the esteemed conservationist and erstwhile co-founder of Church's Chicken, knew he was creating a spectacle, and the press ate it up. Journalists from New York to Berlin covered the story. \"He's going batty,\" one headline read. 4 years after the cave was built, it stood empty. Then, on a hot summer day in August, a journalist from San Antonio followed up and scooped the story. There were no bats. As he prepared a story on \"Bamberger's Folly,\" Bamberger took one last walk up to the bat cave and witnessed ten thousand bats began streaming out. It is the only successful man-made bat cave in the world.","popularity":0.927,"poster_path":"/jNOhNPKdMcNOSfq6K9cSyG1pUys.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Bold Experiment","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
