At the time, the programmed extermination of European Jews had not yet began. After the war, the successive communist governments did all they could to ensure the Iasi pogrom would be forgotten. It was not until November of 2004 that Romania recognized for the first time its direct responsibility in the pogrom. All that remains of this massacre are about a hundred photographs taken as souvenirs by german and romanian soldiers, and a few remaining survivors.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yeGVapWI7CFkmdDpPYDBFjyU9ty.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11331,"logo_path":"/wcHhcw58wms26ejFLx1unYDT37n.png","name":"Cinétévé","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2019-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Death Train","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
