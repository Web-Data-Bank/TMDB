Apparently the Farrelly Brothers sold the producers on the movie by acting out scenes in the office, and initially Steve Martin and Martin Short were wanted for the leads. While Carrey himself isn't interviewed here (which is a shame), there are plenty of clips of his antics from the film used to highlight certain moments in here.","popularity":0.844,"poster_path":"/z8PVmICdusHYI0f9U8qssYPYlh2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-03","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Still Dumb After All These Years","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
