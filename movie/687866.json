In the 1980s she bore the male name of Marek Hołuszko, an active Solidarity movement activist. After 1989 she could not fully enjoy the regained freedom as the place of communism was taken by another enemy, more difficult to defeat, intolerance and exclusion. Gender change made her realize how far away Polish society is from full freedom. Nevertheless, she still believes that it is possible to live in a different Poland, free from stigmatization, persecution and prejudice against others.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":131365,"logo_path":null,"name":"Follow Me Film Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Still Believe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
