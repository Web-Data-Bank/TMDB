Many greats like painters Pandit Seu, his sons Manaku, Nainsukh, and the poet Brajraj were born here. Today the whole  system of patronage under which lofty endeavours were possible even in financially austere conditions is gone. And tragically even the physical landscape is submerged under a dam. The film seeks out some traces of the submerged past, through the memories of those left behind, a condensation of a bygone civilization.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7aneHiBgHLSr4xRa50k2FzizTYQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131397,"logo_path":null,"name":"PSBT","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2019-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Notes on Guler","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
