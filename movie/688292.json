It features a wide range of interviews from children who remember the street parties, to the servicemen who remember not having to buy a single drink that day, then there are the POWs for whom a hot bath was all they wanted after years of captivity.  The programme is richly illustrated with archive including a colour film showing the celebrations in London. Other archive films show a grumpy Montgomery taking the surrender of German land forces in northern Germany on May 4.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/inUsMrvXw4EhI4X9ozf1szOYVkS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"VE Day: Forever in their Debt","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":4}
