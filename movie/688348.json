Using choreographed movement and actions within a plasterboard room without words or narrative - it allows the performers to make and break rules, make us laugh and make us gasp. This production was captured live at the New Adelphi Theatre at the University of Salford. The company, Reckless Sleepers, introduces an entirely new grammar of representation, creating unique and exciting work which challenges how we think about what we see. Playing with meaning, logic and even ‘play’ itself, they present work which is bracing, funny and thought-provoking. Negative Space is the companion piece to their iconic show Schrödinger and brilliantly extends their reputation for original, ground-breaking performance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Negative Space","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
