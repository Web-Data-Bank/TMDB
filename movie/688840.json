The none’s ignite an explosion of energy punctuated by neon hues, deft musicality, and show-stopping singalongs with male-female harmonies, strutting guitars, wild horn arrangements, and interminable grooves. Touring incessantly over the better part of the last decade, the group has organically animated a movement of devout followers and graced stages at legendary theaters and festivals across the country and abroad. None’s A Ton encapsulates an exciting era of the band as it evolves into the next decade.","popularity":0.603,"poster_path":"/161LnBAut87N60hHEUwHn01JFtb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131509,"logo_path":null,"name":"Electric Habitat","origin_country":""},{"id":24388,"logo_path":"/ghQUrooVsdTgEPob6nRIBBC9rO9.png","name":"Mr. Magic Carpet Ride Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":131510,"logo_path":null,"name":"Creative Element","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"None’s A Ton: A Turkuaz Live Concert Film","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
