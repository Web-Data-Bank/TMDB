The music starts with a single rhythmic motif, which subsequently multiplies and unfolds into a rich cornucopia of textures including drums, woodwinds, brass and voice. Reich here ramps up the technique already used in his earlier composition Piano Phase: through minor tempo accelerations the musicians almost imperceptibly push their unison out of joint, resulting in a never-ending volley of canons. In the dance, the choreographic complexity was devised in a similar fashion: a single movement phrase serves as the foundation for an infinite number of variations across time and space. When the music stops and the bodies come to a halt, the audience realizes what they have witnessed: a wave of pure dance and pure sound, a vortex of vital energy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Drumming","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
