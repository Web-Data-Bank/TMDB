That means they will soon become deaf and blind. It is not known how fast that will go, but they already see and hear a lot worse than their peers. How do these two high-spirited girls deal with their development into adulthood, while the time bomb of deafness and blindness ticks inexorably? They are not deterred from getting the most out of life: Lotte is studying to become a photographer and Roos is passing her final exams. At the same time, they also want to do a few things before it is too late, such as seeing the Northern Lights with their own eyes. Director Kim Smeekes followed Lotte and Roos for the film for two years.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rjm41hX2bMUDkdcqZdeWVCI36CH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131562,"logo_path":null,"name":"Laurens Woldberg","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2019-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The sisters Lotte (18) and Roos (16) both have Usher syndrome.
