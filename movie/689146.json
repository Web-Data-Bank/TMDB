Superb, even. And he knows it. The octogenarian tirelessly presses creases in pants and works his way through baskets of uniforms, using just a single washing machine and one dryer in his shop in a back street of Nice. He is becoming a rarity; all around him, the other laundries are closing down. But Jean-Fran√ßois is loyal to his clients, and they to him.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rSrPnq42SwW2pMpcqeWQDJDbpkN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A French Laundry","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
