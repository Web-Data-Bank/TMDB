The 44-year-old has worked as a miner for 21 years, until the mine was closed down for economic reasons. Tomáš then re-trains as a coder in the appropriately named educational programme “New Shift”. What he doesn’t know yet is that his new skills alone won’t get him out of the crisis. A film about a tug-of-war with fate and the employment market.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jIGj98K5g6JRImkrokdRNPcy3tC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46855,"logo_path":"/mWbWalzonARoUitPBhNgqYJMTz1.png","name":"Moloko Film","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":487,"logo_path":"/x3BUIowxU2skXOpnOeOkl7kIYDo.png","name":"Česká televize","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":32930,"logo_path":"/pk1mLuYxSmTWX0BdgzbHdUvRI5u.png","name":"FAMU","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":118555,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Bystrouška","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2021-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Can a dismissed miner reprogram his life?","title":"A New Shift","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
