The longest of all the helter-skelter rides that Berliners have taken through the playground of history ended in 1989 when the Berlin Wall shattered into a million souvenirs. Hundreds of people, mainly young, were killed there trying to escape to the West. The people who built the Wall thought they were building a brave new socialist world. But their dream turned into a nightmare as over time the Wall poisoned, corrupted and brutalized the little world it encircled. In The Secret Life of the Berlin Wall, the dreams and nightmares come dramatically back to life as the spies, informers, double agents and interrogators of Cold War Berlin weave their nervy spells of double lives and double dealing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ohpYJYb0rFPGUf8uwdf37FyTip2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":43923,"logo_path":null,"name":"Diverse Productions","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":15505,"logo_path":"/3MuBcEqLa5QRkZTpXBLzyk9zOmO.png","name":"NHK","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2009-11-07","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Secret Life of the Berlin Wall","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
