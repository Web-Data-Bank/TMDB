Since then, Costa Rica has earned the number one spot in the Happy Planet Index, a ranking of countries based on measures of environmental protection and the happiness and health of its citizens. This documentary brings attention to Costa Rica's inspirational national project, examining the true value of happiness, health, and nonviolence as a defense policy. Pointed contrasts are made with recent U.S. debates over austerity, the military industrial complex and the \"permanent war\" economy.","popularity":0.67,"poster_path":"/6HOFujBB1ZZImOmINgc6iySeF5s.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39388,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bullfrog Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"One nation's quest to abandon the fever of war.","title":"A Bold Peace","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
