Blue surges up from rounds and hollows, blending with incandescent pink plains, revealing what seems to be the outline of the human face. Scribble spins on blue space in abstract, erratic lines, gaining in momentum and mass to form a coherent link to something recognizable. Crude, bold, darting lines. Black and white scribble. A lace work of electric sparks. These are some of the variations encountered in Kuchar's new film VARIATIONS. Live subjects are broken down into their basic outlines and are then reconstructed into startling concepts of spinning patterns and pulsating designs.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1968-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Variations","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
