We see him behind the set of his show, through the ups and downs of his relationship with his wife, friends, with his children, and during his rare moments alone with his personal struggles. With Topaz, one is never certain if it is all just part of a big show that he enjoys not only starring in and directing, but also viewing from the sidelines. This is a penetrating, funny and sad film about a TV star with no limits, whose love for himself depends entirely upon the audienceâ€™s love for him, a man who has succeeded in bursting open the spirit of the times and has crowned himself a post-modern king. King of the ratings.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gVYG425pJIinNJGHN6Tz2hV3Ixk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"THE KING OF RATINGS","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
