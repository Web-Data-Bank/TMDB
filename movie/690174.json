The film presents two main sets: the National Galleries of Scotland in Edinburgh and a mountainous landscape somewhere in the Highlands. The first serves as the stage for the wanderings of a wolf, while the second hosts a caveman sculptor played by Coombes, along with a cavewoman who entombs his body in plaster. In both scenarios, things seem out of place: a savage creature in a museum and a self-conscious artist in the Iron Age. “Love is tender to impression at the surface, like a rock with deep moss upon it, but there is too much mass of love for it ever to be moved.” – Coombes’ sub-personality as the Pictish Man.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wg0iLclpdhJhPTo12AvsmGuuAyp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Discs and a Zed","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
