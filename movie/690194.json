The world premiere recording of Brett Deans new opera based on Shakespeares best-known tragedy: To be, or not to be. This is Hamlets dilemma, and the essence of Shakespeares most famous and arguably greatest work, given new life in operatic form in this original Glyndebourne commission. Thoughts of murder and revenge drive Hamlet when he learns that it was his uncle Claudius who killed his father, the King of Denmark, then seized his fathers crown and wife. But Hamlets vengeance vies with the question: is suicide a morally valid deed in an unbearably painful world?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wDUR443vhEiSmsk6glYS7ysawQW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":36795,"logo_path":null,"name":"Glyndebourne Festival Opera","origin_country":""},{"id":110411,"logo_path":null,"name":"Francois Roussillon Et Associ√©s","origin_country":""},{"id":61417,"logo_path":null,"name":"Medici Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":310,"logo_path":"/4Gp5A4YdjPBfsHT47ngHMaXWmb9.png","name":"CNC","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-06-29","revenue":0,"runtime":163,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Glyndebourne: Hamlet","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
