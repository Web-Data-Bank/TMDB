These movies represent the brilliance and variety of anime, ranging from beautiful Japanese paper animation to powerful multiplane cel cartoons. They also evoke the fascinating complexity of Japan, a nation that is then both marching towards war, enlisting kids in militarist nationalism, yet also delighting in a mixture of modern popular culture, ancient folk tales, irreverent comedy, and the everyday life of prewar Japanese children.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/btAbgVDWTcyniJ50zmQyAxmYtGi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131749,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zakka Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Roots of Japanese Anime Until the End of WWII: 1930-1942","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
