Stop Filming Us creates a cinematic dialogue between Western perceptions and the Congolese experience of reality. While the Congolese perspective becomes increasingly clearer in the film, questions arise about the perspective of the film itself; is a white director able to make a film about the new Congolese image or is it primarily a story created by his own Western perspective?","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/ieTIVInLoMrzxLbCG5dVkkFCXfl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94857,"logo_path":null,"name":"DOXY Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"CD","name":"Congo"}],"release_date":"2020-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"},{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"Swahili","iso_639_1":"sw","name":"Kiswahili"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stop Filming Us","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
