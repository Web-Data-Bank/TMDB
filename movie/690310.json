Both choreographies are known for a vitalist fusion of structural brilliance and virtuosic energy. Not only the superb dancing, but also the costumes by Dries Van Noten and the scenography by Jan Versweyveld participate in the integrated composition of the two performances.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":220,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Drumming & Rain: A Choreographer's Score","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
