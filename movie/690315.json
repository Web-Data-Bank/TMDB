With this vibrant choreography, De Keersmaeker returned, in 2001, to two of her great loves: pure dance and the minimalistic music of Steve Reich. Accompanied by the pulsating tones of his music, for an hour and ten minutes ten dancers occupy the stage, delineated by a curtain of fine strings, displaying an impressive succession of virtuoso dance phrases. The mathematical figures, the sustained repetition, the geometric occupation of the space, the art of continuous variation – everything that had gradually become the choreographer’s signature was pushed to the extreme in Rain.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xg2k29SPaB8ByYr4Eq9f9BTxJ79.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-05-27","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rain","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
