Boyfriends Tim Hamilton and Tommy Hansen vacation on the magnificent islands of Kefalonia, Zakynthos and Mykonos where they sun, swim, and shag anything that move. They meet up with fellow travelers Jeff Daniels and Mark Aubrey. These four modern day Adonises charm Julian Armanis and Gilles Marais, captains of a luxurios yacht, into taking them aboard. From then on it`s a toss-up as to who gives whom the best ride of their lives. The pairing of Tommy Hansen and Mark Aubrey alone is a match made on Mount Olympus. The six episodes in Part 1 will leave you panting for Part 2!","popularity":1.96,"poster_path":"/1PZNd7sq19hS7xtQkCqZpp42xtL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8773,"logo_path":"/hqvLVeaqfTg5dr8310X4EBxwRwi.png","name":"BelAmi Entertainment","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":137,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Greek Holiday 1: Cruising the Aegean","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
