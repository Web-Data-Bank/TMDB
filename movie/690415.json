Tina Frank’s Chronomops opens doors to truly different dimensions: different than digital art’s reductionist studies so common today, different than the serially laid out minimalist images, and different than the omnipresent filtering and layering experiments. Chronomops opens up a shimmering, colorful space that is simultaneously an excess of color, frenzy of perception, and pop carousel. An abstract architecture of vertical color bars is set in endless rotation, whereby the modules and building blocks fly around themselves—and the entire system likewise rotates. The forced movement forms a digital maelstrom whose suction pulls the observer deep into it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fIhovQLXXf9exezgtAFFm9yNLuZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chronomops","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
