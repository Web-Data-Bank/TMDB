My intention in this film was to fill the screen with chaotic movements.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dg0cJqlxDk8EMp2MZRs63C8mvPi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2009-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jam","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
