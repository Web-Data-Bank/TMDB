Hussein and all his supporters were killed; women and children were taken as prisoners. This battle is central to Shia Muslim belief in which the martyrdom of Hussein is mourned by an annual commemoration, Ashura. There are approximately 1 million Caferi Shiites in Turkey, most of which live in Istanbul and the eastern border town of Igdir. In Istanbul they inhabit a shantytown neighborhood in the outskirts of the city, which they started building in the late 1970s. The neighborhood is called Zeynebiye, referring to Husseins courageous sister, Zeyneb. In ASHURA, artist KÃ¶ken Ergun has worked in close collaboration with the people of Zeynebiye, documenting their preparations for the ceremonies in 2010.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hCCTnQxV75NY8E8fw8EWL9cxm2k.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ashura","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
