It is a number that represents a class of excellence seldom seen in professional wrestling, it is a number that set the bar for all ROH World Champions to come. What is thirty-eight? It is the number of successful World Title defenses accomplished by Bryan Danielson in his reign as champion and it is a number only one other man has matched. The list of the competitors who attempted to wrestling the belt from the possession of Danielson read's like a who's who of the top talent in the wrestling world: Roderick Strong, Lance Storm, Austin Aries, Samoa Joe, and KENTA, just to name a handful. For 462 days one wrestler after another made it their mission to dethrone Danielson and for 462 days each of them failed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zdX72dF6FJWdmP7AXpWBoAoeMhL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":396,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bryan Danielson: World Champion","video":true,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
