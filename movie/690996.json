It is the moment when day becomes night, when just briefly at dusk, one thing can be taken for another: friend for foe, sleep for death, you for me, dog for wolf. These scenes from a coast where the Roman fleet is thought to have first landed in Britain – in a language thought to be closest in sound to spoken Latin – are part of an ongoing philosophical enquiry set on the Isle of Thanet. The screenplay is adapted from writings by Virginia Woolf and Raul Ruiz.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/h0DEZHlrN3C2qcMFhMz7u6mXtrX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Between Dog and Wolf","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
