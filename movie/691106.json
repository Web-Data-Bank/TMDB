But what, and who, is lost in the number crunching?  THE LIFE EQUATION introduces us to Jose, a new kind of health worker. When he meets Crecencia Buch, a mother of seven with cervical cancer, he faces a daunting question. The price for her treatment is $10,000 and, at best, it will buy only a few years of life. That money could fund thousands of pap smears -- a cost-effective way of catching cancer early. Should Jose take Crecencia's case on?
