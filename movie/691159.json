Our only hope is Rocky Lazer, the world's greatest pilot, athlete, marksman, sword-fighter, wrestler, and crooner. The President of the United States of Earth sends Rocky and his crew--the annoyingly loyal Chip Skipper, the brilliant Dr. Horst Karlock, and Jean Jarvis, the President's daughter and the Earth's first woman professor--on a dangerous mission into space to stop King Xayno and save the planet! Set in the innocent black-and-white world of 1930's serial adventure stories like Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers, Space Captain: Captain of Space is a modern, smart sci-fi comedy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8fftz3pCKZ0N83MxxUDjfFF5Jpd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":131893,"logo_path":null,"name":"No Tea Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Space Captain: Captain of Space!","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
