Populated by a cast of unforgettable yet lovable deviants, this is one story of greed, bisexuality, confused racial identity, and spontaneous moments of completely unnecessary violence that proved shocking enough to get the movie banned in Italy, Scandinavia, and the Arctic Circle!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qCUC1YTRPaGv6fr30DdzEdLa1VI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Gus Benedict is back, and he's about to collect a bounty... on the mob!","title":"Naples Never Dies...
