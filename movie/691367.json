A few snowflakes were falling, and one of these, the biggest, remained on the edge of the window box. It grew bigger and bigger, till it became the figure of a woman dressed in the finest white gauze, which, appeared to be made of millions of starry flakes. She was delicately lovely, but all ice- glittering, dazzling ice.” -Stan Brakhage from Film Biographies (quoting from the Hans Christian Anderson Story “The Snow Queen”)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uBcfoa51EEKLCPlDYfCn9ZmxNnK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Snow Flukes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
