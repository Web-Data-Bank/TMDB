Following his past as an artist, trying not to sink financially, he decides to take over the family tradition and become a carpenter even though he is aware that that's not the road he wants to walk. UMBERTO is an unscrupulous business man who, for his own financial wellbeing, extorts money from desperate people. While Giovanni is creating a work commissioned by two unusual brothers, Umberto meets ADELE in a hotel room to obtain his 'compensation'.
