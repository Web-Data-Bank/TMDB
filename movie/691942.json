A cook drills a hole in the door to the \"camera obscura\" (lat. dark room) of his boss, a persian-american carpet dealer, who lives together with two women and a narcistic drunkard in a dark carpet-cave. All the characters walk a fine line between professional and private life, between dependence and exercise of power trying to save his/her love. Blatant voyeurism rules. The characters mutually spike their feelings whenever possible driving wedges of love into one another's flesh. Masochistoic institution grows out of romance, which portrayal degenerates into a comedy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sGQs7iU52CFg2qhfthCaZBUVJQO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die Basis des Make-Up","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
