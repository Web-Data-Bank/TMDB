In the first part, a newly-acquainted odd couple discuss desire—and lack thereof—over a bag of potato chips. In the second part, a recumbent woman describes her partner and herself as \"the John and Yoko of the '90s.\" (\"We're in bed most of the time,\" she explains.) The two read aloud, nap and argue beneath the blankets. Ahwesh manipulates the image through chemical and mechanical means, gradually shifting the color scheme from blue to yellow.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tdvrHCluZNWEaC58syGMY05E6df.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Philosophy in the Bedroom","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
