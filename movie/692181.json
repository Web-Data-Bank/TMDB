Niki Lauda made his comeback with McLaren, Keke Rosberg replaced Alan Jones for Williams, Riccardo Patrese drove for Brabham alongside Nelson Piquet, and Eddie Cheever joined Jacques Lafitte at Talbot-Ligier.  The controversy started early in the season with a drivers' strike at the season opener in South Africa leading to a partial race boycott at the San Marino Grand Prix.  There was also tragedy as Gilles Villeneuve and Riccardo Palleti lost their lives and Didier Pironi suffered a career ending crash.  Eventual champion Keke Rosberg took only one win during a season that saw eleven drivers take the top step of the podium, including nine different winners at consecutive races.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pyUHc8D91tVowXKdDM4ByM4fmTM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"F1 Review 1982","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
