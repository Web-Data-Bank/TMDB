With back-to-back drivers' titles, he became the youngest ever to do so and by the penultimate round of the championship was equalling Mansell's record of nine wins in one season.  Schumacher's stunning achievement topped an extraordinarily tough year marked by a strong challenge from chief '94 rival Damon Hill whose Williams-Renault team was chasing a fourth consecutive Constructors' Championship.  The Ferraris thrilled the fans with their speed in the capable hands of Alesi and Berger but were too often sidelined by unreliability. McLaren Mercedes had a disappointing season despite the efforts of Mika Hakkinen.  Above all though, this official review celebrates a magnificent year for Schumacher and the ultra-efficient Benetton team.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p0Doqr12ZJ0uiIuAkBM6IeyK6AT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"F1 Review 1995","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
