Williams-Renault and Jacques Villeneuve were clear favourites as the circus lined up on the grid in Melbourne. But Villeneuve raced all season with the mighty challenge of Schumacher and Ferrari resting heavily on his shoulders.  Villeneuve... Schumacher...Villeneuve...Schumacher...  the battle of the new phenomenon versus the driving genius continued all season long.  Throughout the year there was plenty of excitement and interest elsewhere: McLaren-Mercedes were always a threat; Bridgestone challenged Goodyear’s monopoly; Hill gave a champion’s performance in the Arrows; Berger left on a high and Renault closed their latest chapter in style.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iMwcv50gsIdl4KRpe4PNcTgfRiN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"F1 Review 1997","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
