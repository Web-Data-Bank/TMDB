The three main characters in the documentary Catnip Nation, who live miles apart and come from different walks of life, invite us into a world of advocacy, political wrangling, and legal intrigue. Despite their passion for animals, the success of their battles are mixed but the message is consistent: This nation needs better policy to humanely manage \"community cats,\" and to protect people who look after them.","popularity":0.942,"poster_path":"/vyNx7wPUGXnZ6ALTVqfQnojuKw6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Catnip Nation","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
