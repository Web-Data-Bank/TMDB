Hauling along her decrepit mom and an equally cadaverous aunt, our heroine falls prey to a variety of libido-inspired stresses and also has a tragic debut at a disco club populated by repressed, trailer trash and ousted meteorologists. It's a fast moving trip from north to south with many odd detours for the viewer to relish.","popularity":0.841,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Fatal Desire","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
