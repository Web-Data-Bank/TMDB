It steam-rolls a series of overheated episodes to a colorful climax of redemption and moral rectitude. The rest of it wallows in a swamp of spiritual rot and loose codes of clothing and domestic decency.  The cast is fresh-faced and eager to be involved in this low budget drama of even lower community standards and production values. The plot involves the corruption of a Christian community by the vapors that emanate from those baptized in Libido Lagoon: a drainage pond for everything vile and vitalizing (below the belt).  Join the festivities if you dare, but don't say we didn't seduce you, since the flesh is weak and needs a dip into depravity now and then. Why not try the dark waters of Libido Lagoon for that secret jolt of rejuvenation and revulsion?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Libido Lagoon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
