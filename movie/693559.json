This is the prelude to the most violent confrontations between police and protesters in Sweden for decades. The threat to democracy is a film about the events that preceded what is increasingly starting to resemble a major assault on democracy. The film follows the preparation of the extra-parliamentary left for the protests against the summit and reflects thoughts and ideas on how, as an individual and a collective, one can make his voice heard in today's society.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nsj5tqxEFvT6jPK93Ioa5qWPuaG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2801,"logo_path":"/bswb1PLLsKDUXMLgy42bZtCtIde.png","name":"Film i Väst","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":132247,"logo_path":null,"name":"Marionett Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2002-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hotet Mot Demokratin - om Göteborgskravallerna 2001","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
