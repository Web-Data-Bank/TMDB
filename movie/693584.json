She meets Maya, who's just a bit older. They bond, flee, fight, exchange passionate declarations - The dialogue is destabilizing and enigmatic, the shots are ingenious, and the black and white imagery nothing less than majestic. A film about wandering through simple places, seen in a thoroughly improbable way, with music seeping from the sets and doors opening between trees like so many narrative threads. Above all, this is a quest for infinite love. A waking dream, part poetic experiment and part art film, for the adventurous among us.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xG5IQBdKi4xl7LYV6j0pCgprUwm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":132249,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kanif, productions tous terrains","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2019-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Speak Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
