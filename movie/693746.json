The latest release from New Queer Visions takes a look at representations of boys and men, how desires are hidden from those around them, and how self-belief conquers doubt.  The short films are: Adult (2017); Hello, Stranger [Dag vreemde man] (2016); Little Potato (2017); Juan Gabriel is Dead [Se murió Juan Gabriel] (2018); The Guest [Le convive] (2017); Contestant #4 (2016).","popularity":1.288,"poster_path":"/rs3GcqboF7uYRfmKbCxl2CICGwa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":120864,"logo_path":null,"name":"NQV Media","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"New Queer Visions: Seeing is Believing","video":false,"vote_average":3.7,"vote_count":3}
