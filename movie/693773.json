A ballerina for the Beijing Dance Troop gains an opportunity to move to America. She attends an interview with a U.S Consulate officer to get the visa her fiancé, and is approved. Just as the plane is preparing to take off, the fiancé realizes that there will be nothing for him in America and that he might even become an impediment to his fiancé's success, so he wishes her luck and runs off the plane.
