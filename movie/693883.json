We do not know. Now we’re here, in Arroios, at the Intendente Square. The Intendente of women. They were the ones in charge, they dominate.

The dance of what still resists.” Tiago Pereira","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yQPPEyDZmFWuf0STCY61VFiUUiw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":124892,"logo_path":null,"name":"A Música Portuguesa A Gostar Dela Própria","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"O Intendente é um lugar psicológico","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
