A native of Venice, the cradle of the commedia dell’arte, Damiano Michieletto is sensitive to the burlesque vein of Rossinian music. He transposes the action of this \"unnecessary precaution\" into a contemporary Seville inspired by the cinema of Almodóvar. Bartolo’s monumental building, in which Figaro swirls in free electron, allows the director to give free rein to his crazy imagination.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/48dkZk3i9AqwpByLMTTteSahDPr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-11","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le Barbier de Seville","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
