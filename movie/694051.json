For a comedian, that’s a bit like being a Transformer who doesn’t fancy driving. But don’t let that deter you. There is great pleasure to be had in laughing at her.  Barry Award-nominated for Best Show at the 2011 Melbourne Comedy Festival (where she had to be moved to a bigger venue following ticket demand) and for Best Comedy at the prestigious 2011 Helpmann Award, Mrs Chuckles is a tale of mild success and utter failure told in a manner of vague indifference and total incredulity. It is mostly funny and only fleetingly offensive.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iUSJ3vI3ew7wgLnuFx2SLC9WcV2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hannah Gadsby: Mrs Chuckles","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
