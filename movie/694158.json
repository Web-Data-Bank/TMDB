Timofey Kulyabin, the 35 year old artistic director of the Red Torch Theatre in Novosibirsk, has taken this classic work and reinvented it as an epic parable about finding harmony through suffering. The entire cast, save for one, communicate throughout the performance solely in sign language. By doing this, the selfishness, isolation and lack of mutual understanding are dangerous and laden with disaster, the characters defenseless against a huge \"sounding\" world. Like a score, every scene is composed with sounds and noises.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":237,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Three Sisters","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
