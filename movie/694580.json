Writes Santos: \"Technology is explored in terms of information speed — a feature that makes popular absorption and understanding all the harder. Metaphorically, this process is akin to obtaining information through the ultra-condensation of mere legends and subtitles. Though this may occur in developed countries, such a process displays and unleashes its greatest vigor in a culture such as Brazil's. I Cannot Go to Africa Because I Am on Duty indirectly touches upon values: instead of being concerned with the information-absorption process and with the likelihood of controlling the image-producing process, we are hellbent on running a race, whose sole goal is to employ the latest technological innovation in terms of image production.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/n3PKA8ygKWgOqsSmbwHeI80Ugq0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Cannot Go to Africa Because I Am on Duty","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
