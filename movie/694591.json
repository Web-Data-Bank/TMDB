Images of transit — commuters, buses, boats, subways — stop and start, run backward, and flutter across the screen, yielding brief glimpses of a face or a gesture, as if they are being scanned for meaning. Indeed, by directly addressing the viewer through flashes of text (\"Have you ever been framed?\"), Santos suggests the colonial history that haunts everyday life in modern Hong Kong.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lifJyFzkKtgN8AvPPYyAQgZ9hmh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Framed by Curtains","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
