Ruggles is seen enjoying pie a la mode and ruminating on subjects ranging from Christmas to his incomplete opera The Sunken Bell. The hand-painted film stock heightens the impressionistic vitality of this snapshot of the 84-year-old composer, who is heard paraphrasing Freud: \"Everything that you do is a matter of sex. That is the great passion of life.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/brKuEn8H2yAA6nm8asj2rr0Cziy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Carl Ruggles Christmas Breakfast 1963","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
