When three wise men from the Far East come to visit him, he is initially pleased, but this pleasure turns to anger when he finds out that they have traveled all the way to witness the birth of the son of God. After they depart, he instructs his Prime Minister to kill all children under the age of 2 years. Herod's instructions are carried out, but they don't find the baby Jesus, born in a stable in Bethlehem. Jesus, son of Joseph and virgin Mary, has been destined to lead mankind to a better path but must face many challenges, temptations and betrayal from ones he trusted the most, humiliation, torture, crucifixion, and resurrection.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/5NiBAAUPOsVRYZeiH17UpgziDPA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33,"logo_path":"/8lvHyhjr8oUKOOy2dKXoALWKdp0.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1973-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":121,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jesus","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
