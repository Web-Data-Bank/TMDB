Two students talk about film school. In a classroom, students stand up, one by one, attack and murder a classmate; the wallets fill up with corpses. A boy dances naked in front of a screen on which different images are projected. At the top of a platform, a man in a suit speaks to two naked young men who crawl across the floor. Two boys with clown makeup shed tears looking at the camera. Then they get in a car. Red spots explode and spread slowly across the screen.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cacEKXZbxS0uMoLAUXqSpJvUzCk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20272,"logo_path":null,"name":"Escola de Comunicações e Artes, Universidade de São Paulo","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"1969-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Southern Contest Myth","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
