Moussa, a Moroccan friend of the revolution, helps refugees across the mountains. However, he must go through Beni Boussaid when he finds out that the path he usually takes is no longer safe. Hans, a Communist militant of the GDR, loses a leg on the way, while trying to remove a mine from a passageway. Normally, the wounded and sick are put to rest, but Hans is not a Muslim and cannot be a martyr.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vHmzh22MmatEUbyNKjoU01mYVE2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24520,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dubai Media and Entertainment Organisation","origin_country":""},{"id":24518,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dubai Film Market","origin_country":"AE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sotto Voce","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
