Dating from an early appearance in 1940 – his first meeting with Elmer Fudd in “Elmer’s Candid Camera” all the way through 1954, this Looney Tunes anthology features many firsts – such as the first appearance of the Tasmanian Devil in “Devil May Hare” and Bugs’s first close encounter with a nameless Martian (later named Marvin) and his pet dog K-9 in “Haredevil Hare.” And Bugs’s sparring with Yosemite Sam runs throughout this collection – as they meet during the Gold Rush (“14 Carrot Rabbit”), in a prison (“Big House Bunny”), and on the high-seas as pirates (“Buccaneer Bunny”). But that’s not all folks… there are some thugs after Bugs for a good-luck charm; and Bugs becomes both the Masked Marauder Carrot Thief and a rabbit sandwich! What’s up, Doc? Your spirits, with this must-have collection!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lPgx9nDmj5xNOBVdNiqkV7EMRyR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Looney Tunes Collection: Best of Bugs Bunny Volume 3","video":true,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
