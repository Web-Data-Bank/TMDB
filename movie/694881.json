An image of a Buddhist monastery—a long stone corridor lined with receding columns—appears to jerk forward and slightly recede, or move tremulously back and forth. The single high notes of a piano begin to sound in a halting counterpoint to the agitated image, which fractures into a grid of rapidly pulsating segments. Cho's flickering digital manipulations disrupt the viewer's experience of processional space; his complex layering of highly saturated images results in a weave of frenetically vibrating architectural elements.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/go5uG00X4MoIVKcVRHINY9fGlg5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stoned","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
