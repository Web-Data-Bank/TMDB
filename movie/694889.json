So Max decides to start a collection of his own. Cutting up old newspapers and magazines, Max builds a collection of words. Stamp and coin collections can only get bigger, but with enough words, Max can soon create sentences. And when at last it’s time to write a story, his brothers can’t resist joining in. Max’s Words is a gentle tale of the transformative power of art, and how it can break down barriers and bring us together.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":13636,"logo_path":null,"name":"Weston Woods Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2007-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Max's Words","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
