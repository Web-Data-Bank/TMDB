It is about the social problems that can affect people from various castes, seen through a demented and tragicomic perspective. Dilemmas and situations that nobody wants to talk about even thought we're all familiar with. The languages spoken are Croatian, Italian and the local dialect because of the multiculturality of the region.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8yUBa2b200hyfCroocots6kDqcn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Daghe fogo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
