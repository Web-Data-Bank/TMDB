Even otherwise, she nurses and harbors several two- and four-legged friends in her apartment - just as one would expect from a veterinarian's widow. Her nephew Heinz, on the other hand, is kind of beaten. Not as for the love of animals, that would fit badly to a nascent vet, but for a small animal practice, as the blessed uncle operated, he seems to have no ambitions. A future as a \"Bazillenscheuche\" in the cowshed would like to spare him again Aunt Alma. And she takes her appropriate action.","popularity":0.631,"poster_path":"/acI3r7XZSSv0J8mjvJSvbOVTAnk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":602,"logo_path":"/pVsXRFbYVDe5BhsATCAh1rt5F0k.png","name":"DEFA","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":23372,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fernsehen der DDR","origin_country":"XG"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"XG","name":"East Germany"}],"release_date":"1977-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Viechereien","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
