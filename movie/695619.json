Between wealth and poverty, between homologation and loss of identity, between reality and illusion, nothing more than a great fairy tale, a deception, a collective lie of which the representation of daily life becomes its disturbing metaphor. As disturbing as the smile of Alice's Cat in Wonderland, who, at the girl's request for help to find the way that leads her out of the woods, replies with her characteristic grin: \"It all depends on where you want to go\". The narrative voice is by Marco Paolini.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bjZlBT6BJPe10ozdqdSK1cOFh94.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14556,"logo_path":"/tYNprelutzBIYS68EZsSBGxpQV.png","name":"Jolefilm","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2020-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Alice asked. “which way should I go?” The cat replied, “that depends upon where you want to go.”","title":"The smile of the cat","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
