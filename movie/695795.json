This production in his honour brings together works displaying the infinite diversity of his sources of inspiration and his genius on stage. Be it in the energy of the large-scale Glass Pieces or the intimate sweetness of Afternoon of a Faun and A Suite of Dances, there emerges that rare capacity to make bodies follow the flow in a living comprehension of music. As the celebrated ballet Fancy Free, a veritable theatrical portrait of an era, enters the repertoire, Robbins reveals another facet of his talent.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2BxFrDz2N1SL04flFyKZquSVMP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15355,"logo_path":null,"name":"Opéra National de Paris","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Paris Opera Ballet: Tribute to Jerome Robbins 2","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
