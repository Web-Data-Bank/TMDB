The need for multiple jobs to make ends meet has become a common reality for many families in this country, which leads to a very important question: who looks after the children while their parents work? Through the Night examines the economic and emotional toll affecting some American families, told through the lens of a 24-hour daycare center in Westchester, New York. At the center of it all is Nunu, the primary caregiver and a hero to many families in need of a safe space to bring their children.","popularity":0.943,"poster_path":"/zufIFIl8Mvce7vN57VsSs98xKCb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10943,"logo_path":"/9jd9RFYraPpPCz7rpqp5KhrwfAH.png","name":"ITVS","origin_country":"US"},{"id":13640,"logo_path":"/sUaed08coGdAxraWn7vAvvdRFoQ.png","name":"Corporation for Public Broadcasting","origin_country":"US"},{"id":128100,"logo_path":"/g10mQQuYTsNnytluf1WSGjWkp85.png","name":"Black Public Media (BPM)","origin_country":"US"},{"id":93092,"logo_path":"/6bzhNe066LzwT14dvYmtKNHUK8F.png","name":"Sundance Institute","origin_country":"US"},{"id":152857,"logo_path":null,"name":"Catapult Film Fund","origin_country":"US"},{"id":20590,"logo_path":"/pco0XApCHktibWvUG2IpGj4DBV9.png","name":"American Documentary","origin_country":"US"},{"id":113790,"logo_path":"/tpaJr0p9DUCm4xWrdR6YwuI6TjP.png","name":"JustFilms / Ford Foundation","origin_country":"US"},{"id":105516,"logo_path":"/j1FgbOz1NFwt6iEhdd05dWwr7Z2.png","name":"Latino Public Broadcasting","origin_country":"US"},{"id":117651,"logo_path":"/pLQUQzOhJgjP5dU5nLiQx9sTF35.png","name":"The Bertha Foundation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Who cares for the caregiver?","title":"Through the Night","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
