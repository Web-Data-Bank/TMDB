Structured in three segments, the work suggests the evolution of a mythical being moving from a black void to a natural landscape, and then into an aerial world. Fragmenting and isolating the physical body in space, or in relation to simple elements of landscape, Lucier evokes themes of confinement, the struggle to defy gravity, and a metaphorical desire for transcendence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bIQnQFOcaXDrH3JvK65pHd8pdJ4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the blink of an eye...(amphibian dreams)...\"If I could fly I would fly\"","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
