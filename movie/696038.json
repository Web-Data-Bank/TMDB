Aiming a laser directly at the camera's eye, she burned the vidicon tube. Changing the focal length of the lens and moving the laser, she records the optical effect of the camera's light perception and absorption. The resulting configurations, accompanied by Alvin Lucier's electronic score Bird and Person Dyning, become an abstract calligraphy of light. Lucier's technology-based, visual records of refraction and reticulation refer to the Impressionists' empirical observations of changes in light over a measured period of time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bR3pcLqi6k8oHuwqRxnLiqrLaIa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bird's Eye","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
