The film depicts two types of characters: inhabitants of the fictional planet of gender utopian society that are gender fluid, and real characters who find themselves outside of cisnormativity. It offers another way of seeing gender with its possibility to float between different forms without limitations and restrictions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lXlwhf8E4NIsz7DCOyAm15P0lMo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-02-21","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jellyfish","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
