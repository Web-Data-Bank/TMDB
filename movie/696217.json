But she has already given it to a passionate troubadour whose mother holds a terrible secret.  Surpassing its hugely successful spiritual predecessor Rigoletto, Il Trovatore was an instant triumph. Verdi’s music is so passionate and transcendent that one almost loses sight of opera’s notoriously most implausible plot, complete with burning babies and bloodthirsty vengeance.  NCPA's production of Verdi's opera Il Trovatore will be performing at Opera house of NCPA from October 23-27, 2019.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7dGTX2nyuFsNezU5fv3TDQRvT6d.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Il Trovatore - NCPA","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
