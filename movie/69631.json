He comes to police attention through normal procedures (he was the victim's client), but his outbursts make him the prime suspect of the clever Porfiry. Meanwhile, life swirls around Raskolnikov: his mother and sister come to the city followed by two older men seeking his sister's hand; he meets a drunken clerk who is then killed in a traffic accident, and he falls in love with the man's daughter, Sonia, a young prostitute. She urges him to confess, promising to follow him to Siberia. Will he accept responsibility?","popularity":1.5,"poster_path":"/9OD1NNGIKQQpmuwW6djr2WIW5bO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21978,"logo_path":"/3EP1gJYMGlEt7j17naPMg5e2LH2.png","name":"Gorky Film Studios","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1970-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":221,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crime and Punishment","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":16}
