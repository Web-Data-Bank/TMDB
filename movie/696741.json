The local youth rejects the rigid rules of traditional society. Along with juvenile get-togethers, heroin appears in the mountain valley. As more and more die from overdose, society reacts to the crisis by isolating itself and averting its eyes. The film lifts the veil on the stories untold. Can the memories of this bleak past become part of the Engadine’s acknowledged heritage?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tfzYVTqWuwE7DpQQw4bpMyz6npW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":132003,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alva Film Production","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":132743,"logo_path":null,"name":"RTR","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2020-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Raeto-Romance","iso_639_1":"rm","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Under Blue Skies","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
