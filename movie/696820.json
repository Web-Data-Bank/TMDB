To some he was a lunatic, to others an artist. But to all, he was and still is a mystery.  António Tavares, an important contemporary dancer from Cabo Verde, made an exceptional performance piece based on the life and inner worlds of Kmêdeus. He takes us on a trip through his hometown of Mindelo, the island's music and films, and the celebration of the its annual carnival. It thus becomes a search for the root aspects of one of the oldest Creole communities in the world. Kmêdeus was made by the Cape Verdean film collective Negrume.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sxiXOJjehHoI3hML9DRrpFAxzIj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134726,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kriolscope","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CV","name":"Cape Verde"}],"release_date":"2020-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kmêdeus","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
