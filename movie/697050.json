He is fire and ice at the same time. His attraction is animalistic, his looks frightening. From the ghetto of the Bronx in New York he has made it onto the big stage – from Broadway to Hollywood. As Michael Corleone in \"The Godfather\" he celebrated his big breakthrough at the beginning of the 70s – against much resistance, because apart from director Francis Coppola himself nobody wants him for the role. His realistic acting became the measure of all things overnight.","popularity":0.695,"poster_path":"/9tCNhqUIut31Alet6Bz7gIg8EGv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70551,"logo_path":"/9X52qZHMbEBRyz7ReQY61TPVzOY.png","name":"Broadview TV","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":13668,"logo_path":"/azhapBvZ8g1UWyyQQhhcRR9bM9x.png","name":"RTS","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2020-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Al Pacino: The Reluctant Star","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":9}
