Business is bad and one of the female cabbies reads an \"ad\" in the newspaper calling for women chauffeurs, so she goes to the garage and gets the job. Getting into the auto, she starts out and makes for the railway station, where there is a good opportunity to do a record business. Her first passengers load into the machine and, after giving directions to the lady in charge, she starts down the street.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1908-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les femmes chauffeuses","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
