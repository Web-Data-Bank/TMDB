The ugly woman passes on, however, and on reaching the store of a beauty doctor, decides to step in. The M.D. promises her complete satisfaction and gets busy promptly. First he subjects her mud-colored marcelled hair to a treatment, and in a little while she has beautiful raven-black hair. He massages her face and removes all dermatological defects, and finally gets to work on her teeth; in a few more seconds the woman emerges from the place a fine specimen of natural brunette beauty, with teeth like so many pearls. This time when she meets a gentleman on the street he promptly offers his arm.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1908-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'institut de beauté","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
