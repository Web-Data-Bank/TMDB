Satterwhite writes: “‘Reifying Desire 1–6’ will use 230 3-D modeled versions of my mother’s drawings, my body, and animated figures. The intersection of the disparate disciplines including dance performance, drawing, and digital media acts as an exquisite corpse strategy for guiding the storyline. Ordinary utilitarian objects become queered and repurposed in pursuit of defining a new utopian and nonpolitical space for me to perform in. The result is an overlap of visual trajectories between my mother and I—her private domestic documentations/inventions and my public reactions to pop culture, art history, and political histories.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rCVjlBtRAcb2Efib6tLKESt24M1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reifying Desire Three","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
