In this investigation he examines the journey to the crossing location, looking at two competing views of the Red Sea Miracle. One he calls the “Egyptian Approach,” which looks near Egypt. The other he calls the “Hebrew Approach,” which looks far from Egypt to the Gulf of Aqaba where divers have been searching for the remains of Pharaoh’s army on the seafloor. The investigation raises giant questions about the real location for the crossing site and its implications on your view of God. The answers to these questions point to one of two very different realities.","popularity":0.647,"poster_path":"/qtjpna9wNSnZtw2axZIjnz43r3q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Patterns of Evidence: The Red Sea Miracle","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
