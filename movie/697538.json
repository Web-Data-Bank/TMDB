Revealed by Paul Morrissey in the trilogy \"Flesh\" (1968), \"Trash\" (1970) and \"Heat\" (1972), he established himself as an icon of underground cinema thanks to stripped roles, becoming the liberator of the male nudity in Cinema. The one who inspired the song \"Walk on the Wild Side\" to Lou Reed is now in his sixties, happy manager of a property close to Hollywood Boulevard. In his courtyard, seated on a low wall, he evokes with amusement and nostalgia his youth and his various collaborations with Warhol, Morrissey, Coppola, Waters, Breillat or Rivette.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qa2xqbRVSzfu7csyaksJQHXerj3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Joe Dallesandro, a Naked Angel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
