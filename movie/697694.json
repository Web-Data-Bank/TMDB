Combining images of contemporary Ireland with an evocative blend of archive, What We Leave in Our Wake questions what persists rather than the temporary fluctuations and trends, and talks to some of those uniquely placed to comment on how this country has evolved.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"'The most valuable things are often times the things that are not true.'","title":"What We Leave in Our Wake.","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
