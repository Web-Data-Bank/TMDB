The woman isn't local and while the Ontario Provincial Police have taken the lead in the investigation, Walter assists where he can. The town is mostly a close-knit Mennonite community and Walter has recently returned to his church. He is also trying to deal with his own temper that led to a violent incident some months before. As the young woman is identified, it becomes apparent that Walter's former love interest may be lying.","popularity":5.813,"poster_path":"/lGXjm0ikB4cZXiEU47UKxDfbNFI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24195,"logo_path":null,"name":"Resolute Films and Entertainment","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":53568,"logo_path":null,"name":"3 Legged Dog Films","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2010-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Small Town Murder Songs","video":false,"vote_average":5.357,"vote_count":42}
