Partic­u­larly notice­able this year are the numerous video and sound works. One that sticks in your memory is Haris Epaminonda’s “Chimera” (2019). In her 30-minute film, she combines found-footage shots with a sound­scape by Kelly Jayne Jones and creates medi­ta­tive images of aban­doned places and land­scapes, which hover some­where between memory and concep­tual construc­tion. The work deservedly earned Epaminonda the Silver Lion.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mq1CmI4XtoIuAaeumDhv9WLukD2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chimera","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
