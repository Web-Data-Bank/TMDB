Four survivors of childhood abuse, now high-functioning and successful adults, find themselves suspects in an investigation into a series of vigilante murders. Behind the careful facades of their households lie dark and disturbing secrets. Two detectives-a seasoned cop whose soul is jeopardy, and his impetuous female partner-attempt to track down a killer with an aberrant agenda and a creative vision of karmic justice. In order to find the killer and put an end to the murders, they seek counsel in a conflicted psychiatrist who finds herself in a dangerous position-torn between her patients, and falling in love with a detective who may unhinge their world.","popularity":0.631,"poster_path":"/1eS8Qv1c8i7N1xANYdyF9jXcf90.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":132910,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sanitatum Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sanitatum","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
