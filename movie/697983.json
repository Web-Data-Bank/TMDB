Kim Woon Ki's kooky mystery thriller \"Wanted\" is set in a peaceful village suddenly disrupted by heavy rainfall and the appearance of a strange old woman named Selma. Yeon Sang Ho's 3-D animation \"Love is Protein\" is an inventive black comedy about three poor roommates who break their piggy banks to order fried chicken - only to discover their prospective meal is the son of a weeping chicken. Jang Hyung Yoon's surreal \"A Coffee Vending Machine and Its Sword\" follows a swordsman who reincarnates as a coffee vending machine and falls in love at first sight with the maintenance girl.","popularity":0.63,"poster_path":"/6e5TQYx0aSy6GVk3EmaTEDGGqxG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Indie Anibox: Selma's Protein Coffee","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
