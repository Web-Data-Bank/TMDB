His drawings, room installations, murals, and computer-generated videos confront intercultural and deeply humane questions in the age of digital media. Netzhammer persistently checks the boundaries between perception of autonomy and heteronomy, thereby creating images that have a powerful presence and focus on the hierarchy between human-beings, animals, plants, and objects. He poses questions concerning our relationship with nature and to other cultures, concerning the fear of loss of self, facing a growing mediatization and technologization of the world, permeate the surreal images of the artistâ€™s inventions. Simultaneously, by using increasingly theatrical installations, Yves Netzhammer transposes the imaginary world of artistic animated films and computer graphics into a new kind of space.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Saws child is the board","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
