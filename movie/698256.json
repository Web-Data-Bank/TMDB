Dan mocks those who believe in the lizard illuminati, a flat earth, the notion that you can sell your soul to Satan, and more. Dan even makes fun of himself for once having sex with a banana peel in a grocery store bathroom - nothing's too weird or dark. Dan jokes about his kids, his ongoing hatred of strangers, and even offers to improve the world by killing a lot of people.
