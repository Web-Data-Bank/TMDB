As he follows a string of clues to uncover his identity, he discovers that he’s been living two different lives: one as a super-successful crime kingpin, surrounded by beautiful women, expensive toys and a lavish lifestyle, and the other as an undercover CIA agent, but with a puny salary, no family or home life whatsoever and zero trappings of success. The problem is, he can’t remember which of these two personas is his true identity.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":121470,"logo_path":"/zvJFu1C6gB80A98n6IGXBvMtgVl.png","name":"87North Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":122771,"logo_path":"/bYRqVEAuaC1QWmt3hGo0PMdK7EX.png","name":"Westbrook Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Fast and Loose","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
