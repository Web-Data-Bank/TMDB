Sketches are hung on clotheslines to dry. The red paint drips from the drawings like fresh blood. An inscription on the wall: 'Tabaski, who's next?'. Three characters and a sheep revolve around him and reconnect him with reality. This hybrid movie, blending fiction, performance and history, is freely inspired by the painter Iba Ndiaye (1928- 2008) and his work entitled 'Tabaski'. 'Painting is remembering', he said.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/znzeNUIPzDU4MUGmCmznET3n3C9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"SN","name":"Senegal"}],"release_date":"2019-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Wolof","iso_639_1":"wo","name":"Wolof"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tabaski","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
