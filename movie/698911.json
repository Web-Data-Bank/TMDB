Far from a new phenomenon, this documentary traces the leveraging of Christianity by the state all the way back to when the Christian faith became the official religion of the Roman Empire. Through interviews with a diverse group of scholars, pastors, historians, and activists, this film shows how specific readings of the Bible have led many Christians to confuse their devotion to Jesus with their dedication to the state.","popularity":0.721,"poster_path":"/jI1CihtrFD0ih069ecGmVQz7A4D.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"One nation under God?","title":"J.E.S.U.S.A.","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
