Friends since childhood, Kaienkwinehtha and Kasennakohe are members of the traditional community of Akwesasne on the U.S./Canada border. Together, they undertake a four-year rite of passage for adolescents, called Oher√≥:kon, or \"under the husk.\" The ceremony had been nearly extinct, a casualty of colonialism and intergenerational trauma; revived in the past decade by two traditional leaders, it has since flourished. Filmmaker Katsitsionni Fox has served as a mentor, or \"auntie,\" to many youth going through the passage rites.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/orHRxiDv4MLELXZlXMYg49r24jh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Two Mohawk girls on a challenging journey to becoming women.","title":"Ohero:kon - Under the Husk","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
