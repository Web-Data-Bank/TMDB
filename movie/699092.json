This is the premise of a conceptual documentary based on the concept of providing a deliberately limited amount of information to the viewer. We look into the intimate space behind the closed front door, where the most ordinary activities are carried out: cooking lunch, preparing tea, eating lunch, starting a fire in the fireplace. In this residential monodrama, a second living actor is desperately lacking, one that would bring to life the plot embodied in speech. It becomes a study of a person’s existence in their most personal space - a dwelling that can be just as much a preserve of peace and security as a golden cage of solitude.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tQg6O4ANUxG6HHfy6hl4klLF0n4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AZ","name":"Azerbaijan"}],"release_date":"2018-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Day in Selimpasha","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
