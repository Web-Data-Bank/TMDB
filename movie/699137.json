English, French and Ancient Egyptian tongues create not a drone like repetition but an insistence. Returning frequently to the image of journeying, the film’s destination remains unknown. When we do encounter the natural world in Hypnos, it cannot be located in a specific place or time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6i4buBTqjGFnvCOkKsu43QivYZB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hypnos","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
