Proper instruction as to how the bowls are played allows us to witness the care and gentle guidance of a teacher, Kabbalah, and her student, Florence. Rhythmic vibrations on the bowl’s surface are captured in high speed 16mm film, revelling in grain and colour. A delight to watch, the film flits between the natural world and sonic: a luscious deep purple flower in the half-light and the clear tone of a singing bowl.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hBbOjy9DBFJU4L8u9Z1QTEiPQZC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gaia Mama","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
