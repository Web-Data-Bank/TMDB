Doyle, like many of his contemporaries, has struggled to maintain a healthy balance between life and music. The evidence of years spent pursuing a completely original sound is all around him. It is in his eyes, in his home and in the voices of his family. This film tells the story of a man who managed to live through his relationship with music. Now nearly 70, Doyle seems to be defying those forces that would keep him as a footnote in the history of American music.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qET6fZ3tI6rwooXfoCRiKHH3we1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Life, Love and Hate of a Free Jazz Man and His Woman","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
