It's a candid, well-conceived documentary that kept me entertained and engaged throughout. Harlan Coben, the author of Tell No One, talks about the film adaptation and how actor-director Guillaume Canet approached it. Later on, the director also shares his thoughts on the film while we see plenty of raw footage from the shooting process. Also, there is footage from Studio Labo M2 where the film's soundtrack was recorded. Finally, there are plenty of scattered comments from the cast addressing the film production.","popularity":0.642,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":2612,"logo_path":"/3ulBLchjjnjVmvyLQSwO62MDKLE.png","name":"Les Productions du Trésor","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":6896,"logo_path":"/2Q89KvzxTKB5BAv9RqFIPI1qb7E.png","name":"EuropaCorp","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":1115,"logo_path":"/ntH7T5gsN6wtyrfHGHJDTuneQ7o.png","name":"M6 Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":56717,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cameo Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2007-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tell No One: The B-Side","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
