Both images are processed through the Cox Box. The loop of the jumping boy had developed, over time, a network of miniscule cracks in the emulsion which were further emphasised by the increased contrast of the processing and the slow motion.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zQpb1S6q8VLPf1PedIAWa5TcvIr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jumpcut","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
