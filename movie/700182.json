Since Mona Hatoum refuses to produce the same work twice, she generally creates one single site-specific performance. However, in 1984, she decided, with Variations on Discord and Division, to provide an action that could be adapted to different spaces. She thus offered several possibilities for actions and “variations”. Through this performance and the various forms that it may take, the artist deals with notions of exile, war and oppression. This work consists of several little abstract scenes, which represent for the artist ways of experimenting with specific situations.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5KGAgXIxmTVVqI3nnapyAMW4HHI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Variations On Discord and Divisions","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
