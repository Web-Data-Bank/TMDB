Told from the perspective of the writer—who is played by more than one actor, and who also plays the character—the film blurs the lines between roles, reality, time and space. The words and text of the writer also interplay with the sound of silence and the actions of the actors and characters.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ujRD6eHO9FQF2XcdYw1pQeC2pAM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76586,"logo_path":"/8IToSMttTBtO40fWsxSd1HES4cS.png","name":"Akanga Film Asia","origin_country":"SG"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Tamil","iso_639_1":"ta","name":"தமிழ்"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Song of the Waves","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
