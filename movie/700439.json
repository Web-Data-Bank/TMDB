He finds himself entwined every day in the lives of his neighbors. They're polite, friendly, down-to-earth people. But in any community, individuals have their own private passions that their neighbors will never know. Each has a dark secret, a disappointed dream, a fervent hope, a spirit-breaking fear. We accompany Nathan while he comes of age and observe with him as the layers fall away from this seemingly random array of ordinary people who, below their practiced, Christian surfaces, are extraordinarily human.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zwhHdCHPBWNr1nkx2RmnvM6W701.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":133304,"logo_path":null,"name":"923 Films","origin_country":""},{"id":66284,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rogue Arts","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chicago Heights","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
