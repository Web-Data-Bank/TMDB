And yet she does, over and over again. Illuminated by a single spotlight, she first appears in a shoulder stand, head and legs tucked away like secrets she has yet to share. A torso of curves and muscular undulations becomes crab-like, as limbs slowly unfurl horizontally, stretched long and wide. Each move is an anatomical surprise, taking her naked body back through evolution with gentle arms that flap like fins and twitching shoulder blade wings.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kokoro","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
