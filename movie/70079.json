Assuming that Francesca killed him and sent him for cleaning up, he cuts him up in pieces, puts him in a suitcase and tries to get rid of it... but he has a hard time finding a suitably quiet place. Unfortunately there's a witness, who comes back on him. One thing leads to another, and the normally shy and overly fearful Frederico has to rid himself of more and more corpses until this black comedy ends.","popularity":0.854,"poster_path":"/klOiOfnPhkzEyhd3RY54Nozq7hH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11757,"logo_path":null,"name":"Produzioni Intersound","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1992-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nero","video":false,"vote_average":4.7,"vote_count":5}
