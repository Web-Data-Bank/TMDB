It was a country with extremely lax labor regulations and a very permissive attitude towards cultural expression. As a result, it became a hotbed for the production of cheapie movies. Their history and the genre itself are detailed in this breezy, nostalgic documentary.","popularity":3.404,"poster_path":"/pZfhyYIBeH0j4uE7gYum1mhE2ju.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6842,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fury Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":55979,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bionic Boy Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":105801,"logo_path":"/3rh9RoodRlCw3urr21LG0gYZvSs.png","name":"MIFF Premiere Fund","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2010-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Filipino revolution that even Marcos couldn't crush!","title":"Machete Maidens Unleashed!","video":false,"vote_average":6.927,"vote_count":41}
