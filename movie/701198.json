A static, black and white, provincial landscape, full of emptiness, animal farms and a lonely car racing the empty streets. In a world that once was at a constant fight, the things that used to be considered important now seem so strange. The one and only thing that still exists is the gravity; things do not fall apart.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p6mZUoz97E0iZwi1mBS7W3vXIXu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":132155,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Onassis Foundation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2020-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fighting World","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
