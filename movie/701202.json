Itâ€™s a game that allows us to give into the loss of perspective that this moment has created: where our sense of time, reality, and the future has radically shifted. We invite others to watch and play The Game, share your videos, and allow us to create a worldwide collection, archiving the tragedy and absurdity of all our confinement.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p6mZUoz97E0iZwi1mBS7W3vXIXu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":132155,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Onassis Foundation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2020-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Game","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
