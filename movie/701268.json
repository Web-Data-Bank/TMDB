In a departure from the detached quality of black-and-white archival footage, Gour offers a hopeful imagination of Singapore then and showcases his playful infatuation with its urban environment.  A 4K restoration of Sunshine Singapore was made possible using the surviving 16mm film print preserved by the Asian Film Archive and restored by Cineric Inc. in 2018.\"  (Asian Film Archive)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rnAfEaeVpYXLjVouHCxA9cxUzbW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"1972-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The film captures the hopes of the young filmmaker, the beauty of a young nation, tempered by the familiarity of daily life.","title":"Sunshine Singapore","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
