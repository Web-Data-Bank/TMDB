Understanding that the public’s knowledge of wartime experience was limited to newsreels and photographs, Lee complements such footage with first-hand accounts and footage to help audiences better understand and sympathize with the brutal realities of war. From leaving families and loved ones to fighting on the battlefield and risking lives, nearly each personal facet is explored and discussed in Lee’s powerful testament.  This film was probably either inspired by, or the inspiration for, Samuel Cummins' production of the same title (q.v.)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1934-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forgotten Men: The War as It Was","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
