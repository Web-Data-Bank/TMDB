The film employs several codes of conflict and discord—from the territorial border of India and Pakistan to visuals of Tibetan refugee settlement— to satiate the curiosity to posit violence as a credible response to hurt and harm. It questions its worthiness as device to exact revenge on the transgressor.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/i8wPjjL5UYvABxXSTlaokjCvNbS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1997-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Season Outside","video":false,"vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2}
