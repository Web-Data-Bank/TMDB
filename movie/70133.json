In order to pay the troops Wellesley needs a money draft from the banker Rothschild, but fears he has been captured by the French and sends Sharpe behind enemy lines to find him. Sharpe is given command of a platoon of crack riflemen, led by the surly Irishman Harper and including Hagman and Harris, who resent Sharpe as not being a 'proper officer'.","popularity":3.37,"poster_path":"/yqlInABgkRM4sldonrEcAeJZaXA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7783,"logo_path":"/gXDRmyPivfsS5jVAoDdrbhpdyk7.png","name":"Celtic Films Entertainment","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":3649,"logo_path":null,"name":"Central","origin_country":""},{"id":7782,"logo_path":null,"name":"Picture Palace","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1993-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"Yiddish","iso_639_1":"yi","name":""},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"},{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sharpe's Rifles","video":false,"vote_average":6.423,"vote_count":39}
