Unist’ot’en Camp, Gidimt’en checkpoint and the larger Wet’suwet’en Nation are standing up to the Canadian government and corporations who continue colonial violence against Indigenous people. The Unist’ot’en Camp has been a beacon of resistance for nearly 10 years. It is a healing space for Indigenous people and settlers alike, and an active example of decolonization. The violence, environmental destruction, and disregard for human rights following TC Energy (formerly TransCanada) / Coastal GasLink’s interim injunction has been devastating to bear, but this fight is far from over.","popularity":0.963,"poster_path":"/kKIgfnr0x7T2fJw8ZD8XN08ksaS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121359,"logo_path":"/8jTVa5tdWScXEpx6hhJA2Hwe1LK.png","name":"Mutual Aid Media","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Invasion","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2}
