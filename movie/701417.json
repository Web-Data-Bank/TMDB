The images Fogel kidnapped are those of several young men, some nude, seemingly alone together in a small, ancient-looking bedchamber. The differences in frame-rate between camera and monitor cause black horizontal bands to strobe languidly up and down the screen; the five layers of media transmission have washed out the original colors into an electric blue-gray . . . The total effect is one of deep, erotic longing. It presents the metaphor of cinema as an eternally youthful, luminously beautiful 20-year-old boy, who is nevertheless slipping away, through layers of time, into a tantalizingly unreachable distance.\"\r â€”Ed Halter","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4jfV1WSXm9tNgptsmCPjIJJR4U7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Endless Obsession","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
