The rural worker Jiaul, the Bihari brahmin Ram, the homeless drug-dealer Manoj and the young student Tashi live in the same city of Kolkata, but in different worlds. The film tried to find out a few answers - What beliefs rule their everyday lives? How are they affected by the sudden demonetisation? What makes them strangers? And how do people – whose paths would never cross in real life – interact in a cinematic space, where as many signs of their belonging as possible have been ‘stripped off’ and they encounter one another for the first time?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5tXXnh38XOC7x2be7qXxjTbA9js.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2019-12-26","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"STRANGERS","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
