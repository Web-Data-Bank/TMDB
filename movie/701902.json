Interviews reveal a population on the periphery that was the hidden counterpoint to the economic miracle. In the big image of the film, the cameraman travels hanging on the bus, along with other passengers. This subjective image in the narrative places the viewer on the side of the population who daily risk themselves to go to work.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"1973-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ônibus","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
