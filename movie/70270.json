She is capable of changing her facial mimic so much that she never looks artificial or inappropriate. 39-year-old François meets 22-year-old Muriel, who is a virgin. Several times he invites her to fine restaurants. She agrees that on a certain day they will meet at a hotel and he will see her naked. He promises not to sleep with her at that occasion. He does not keep his promise. She is happy that he didn't. Both continue to be eager for sex.","popularity":3.214,"poster_path":"/lllbjY8mv3z9SqaJXIYAwycqhbs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16485,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lazennec Bretagne","origin_country":""},{"id":5869,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Productions Lazennec","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":13320,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films du Trésor","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1997-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Banned Woman","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":21}
