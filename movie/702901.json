Ein Film für Ilse Aichinger","overview":"Stillness, observing and the absurd are the secrets behind Ilse Aichinger’s poetry, as brought to life in the film WHERE I LIVE. Figures from stories come to life in a house, whose stories sink in upon themselves. Also, never before shown Super-8 footage shot by Aichinger, inspires awe at our ability to find ourselves, as well as the ways in which we find ourselves. Taking a sensuous approach, the film engages with Ilse Aichinger’s work, which stands out in the 20th century for its singularity whilst remaining timeless in its existential dimension.","popularity":0.653,"poster_path":"/zj2pGWc2BYFIX8rDsvTYDlZqzco.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wo ich wohne.
