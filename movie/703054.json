The Burton production was recorded in live performance from 17 camera angles and edited into a film that was shown as a special event for only two days in nearly 1,000 movie houses across the U.S. The idea of bringing a live theater experience to thousands of simultaneous viewers in different cities was trumpeted as a new form called “Theatrofilm,” made possible through “the miracle of Electronovision.” The Wooster Group attempts to reverse the process, reconstructing a hypothetical theater piece from the fragmentary evidence of the edited film.  We channel the ghost of the legendary 1964 performance, descending into a kind of madness, intentionally replacing our own spirit with the spirit of another.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/o7ux57sA0upoc7y677eVRH4N2pg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118622,"logo_path":"/mgblq6fFxCbZH8DfmdRKro6NToV.png","name":"The Wooster Group","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hamlet","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
