Their idea is simple: to bring five young Swiss people to the Arctic Circle to observe the signs of global warming through direct experience and raise awareness among their peers as strongly as possible. The great adventure begins: for three weeks the crew of the San Gottardo ship will sail in hostile and spectacular landscapes at the same time. Armed with their cameras, the young explorers will document the health of the end of the world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/q9dzQS7AizfGdOPsdSDIaB6wenZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20960,"logo_path":"/9mO8Z3dcW6ISVMeCv7TbXtWXdGl.png","name":"RSI","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Messages from the End of the World","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
