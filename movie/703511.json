Although his beloved requites his love, happiness slips out of reach when his obsession with the powerful secret drives him to madness.  Set in imperial Russia, Tchaikovsky’s late brooding thriller about a fanatic gambler is a tour de force of stirring melancholy, consuming passion and grand sweeping orchestration. If the opera saw the light of day thanks to his brother, the librettist Modest Tchaikovsky, The Queen of Spades soon became Pyotr I. Tchaikovsky’s personal obsession: composed in only 44 days, he considered it a masterpiece.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Queen of Spades - Tchaikovsky","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
