When his time is up, he outwits the messengers of Hell, only to be turned away from the gates of heaven.  It is a rare treat to discover an unknown opera, all the more so when opera houses are forced to remain closed. In Ersan Mondtag’s vivid, politically charged staging, Schreker’s ‘magic opera’ enchants as a colourful cocktail of musical influences ranging from reminisces of Kurt Weill to baroque counterpoint.  Co-produced with Nationaltheater Mannheim.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5k86ZqXozNR0l00qKUsTjNx4k0R.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der Schmied von Gent","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
