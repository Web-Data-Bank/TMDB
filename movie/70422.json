The son is testy, so they go into town and watch a circus-like thrill ride. The daredevil woman in the show looks exactly like one of the women in the movie, so the man invites her to join them for a nightcap. Tensions among the family seem to rise. She stays overnight, and during her 24 hours in the castle, each of its three residents involves her in a fantasy. She, in turn, keeps asking, \"Who has the gun?\" Will there be violence before it's over?","popularity":4.661,"poster_path":"/yB8Y26C9r1vaB6k0amhPUodrPBu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11639,"logo_path":null,"name":"Peter Carsten Produktion","origin_country":""},{"id":83138,"logo_path":null,"name":"Carstein","origin_country":""},{"id":1374,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinemar","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1970-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Body to body is the name of the game","title":"The Lickerish Quartet","video":false,"vote_average":5.625,"vote_count":36}
