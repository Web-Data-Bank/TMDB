A cache hit occurs when the requested data can be found in a cache, while a cache miss occurs when it  cannot. Cache hits are served by reading data from the cache, which is faster than recomputing a  result or reading from a slower data store; thus, the more requests that can be served from the cache,  the faster the system performs.\" (Wikipedia)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9midbBwQG7J5lXPhSb0UOASeduW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"MUCUS (uncacheable)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
