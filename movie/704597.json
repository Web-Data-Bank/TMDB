Of course I had seen dozens of reproductions in books and postcards by then and the popular mythology of the enigmatic smile was already well engrained in my mind. My strongest impression, as I recall, was how small and unsurprising it was – a heavily protected cultural icon – no longer really a picture – and I was much more excited by the painting of the distant landscape than by the face. My own ‘version’ of ‘la Giaconda’ was never an homage, nor like Marcel Duchamp’s ‘L.H.O.O.Q’, an attack on its cultural power. Instead it came from a fascination with change and transformation – maybe also with arbitrary appropriation.\" Malcolm Le Grice","popularity":0.676,"poster_path":"/uCduHi7Yj3g6bwr6mGdR1p0kheO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2016-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"BFI Southbank, Blue Room, 27 May 2016.","title":"Eighteen fragments from Malcolm Le Grice’s After Leonardo","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
