Xun-Qing, a longtime city-girl from the country side, revisits her village after some years to see her father, Zhou, a soft-spoken elderly man who owns and still operates his humble brick factory. However, now he does so with visibly aging hands. A worried Xun-Qing wholeheartedly suggests he move to the city to live a \"better life\" with her. Their already fractious relationship further deteriorates when her offer is met with Zhou's emphatic rejection, thus re-opening past wounds turning conversations into quarrels. Caught in the midst of the storm are the brick factory workers, one of whom is Xiao-Bing - a hard-working, steadfast young man unorphaned by Zhou as a child. Throughout the ordeal, Xun-Qing finds familiar and kindred solace in Xiao-Bing's blunt brotherly advice, just like their childhood years.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/poVWxOQlRbdUxQqQm9bxr3KHgjh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-11-14","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"26 Happiness Road","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
