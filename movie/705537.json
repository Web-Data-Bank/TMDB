By his own estimate, over his half-century career, Rice wrote more than 22,000 columns, 7,000 sets of verse, and over a thousand magazine articles. But his story began in the heart of SEC country, as \"Granny\" Rice was born in Murfreesboro, Tenn., went to Vanderbilt, and then began a remarkable journalism career, with his first job at the Nashville Daily News for $5 a week. This is the story of not an athlete but an observer, poet and storyteller - a giant in the world of sports.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"By Grantland Rice","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
