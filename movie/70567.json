With his latest film, Block turns in the other direction, offering an exceptionally moving film about his relationship with his only child, Lucy. THE KIDS GROW UP is a chronicle of Lucy's emotionally-fraught last year at home before leaving for college. Moving fluidly between past, present and the fast-approaching future, Block uses a lifetime of footage to craft not only a loving portrait of a girl transitioning into womanhood, but also an incredibly candid look at modern-day parenting, marriage, and what it means to let go.","popularity":1.213,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Letting go is hard to do","title":"The Kids Grow Up","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":4}
