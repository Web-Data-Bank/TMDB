The Suape Complex controls the region and through its #miliciasuape it has been intimidating, expelling and removing the local populations. A carpenter, Mr. Biu has fabricated tables for years; in her project made for “Convocatória para um Mobiliário Brasileiro” (“Open Call for a Brazilian Furniture”) an installation at the MASP (Art Museu of São Paulo), the artist Carla Lombardo dubbed these tables as “Gentrificada” (“Gentrified”). The movie builds a regime of visualization with technical images that invite us to think about representation and orientation in a world of data.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/npCCLkp5rLbJCMdOg73DMyXdDzG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2017-08-05","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seu Biu, Meu Atlas","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
