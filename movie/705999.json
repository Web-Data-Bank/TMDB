A team of crooks is following her, though, in hopes she'll uncover the missing money and they can grab it from her. She checks into a hotel where Franklyn Green works as a desk clerk. Franklyn is learning to be a detective through a correspondence course, and he thinks he's just the guy to help Miriam solve her mystery. The fact that she's a very attractive lady doesn't hurt, either.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oAReTmNWua9nK8LEAcetiRz3PJU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5488,"logo_path":"/3O2mAL8Z32SbKtQK7h9ePZjtzSu.png","name":"Fox Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1929-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"EVERYBODY TALKS in this First All-Talking FARCE-COMEDY","title":"The Ghost Talks","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
