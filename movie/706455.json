Wells called \"The Country of the Blind\"â€”about a man who travels to a country of blind people and attempts to dominate their sensual, feminine culture with his male, sight-derived power. Following this theme, \"Blind Country\" begins with animated fruit dancing over Mike Kelley's body and the admonition of \"Northerners\" to \"refill the quickly emptying sack.\" In the male-dominated land of the North, candy-spurting pinatas stand as phallic symbols. Presumably castrated, and stripped of his authority, Kelley acts the buffoon as he is led through the murky land of the South, a \"female,\" earthy, \"realm of the senses\" opposing the phallocentric world of the North.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tnmip3g3usJFxJ3lghdGvPbjHN7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blind Country","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
