In the 1960s and 70s thousands of young Lebanese left their villages and searched for a new life in the city – as countless like-minded people around the globe. The port of Beirut, the city’s economic lung and central urban district, provided work for truck drivers - a job that stressed masculinity and became a lifestyle. The income allowed the young men to participate in the vibrant urban life, to enjoy their time at the always busy Burj Square with its many cinemas and restaurants as well as to start families.  During the years of the civil war (1975-90) the drivers were needed to maintain the supply of food, goods, and sometime weapons between the divided sectors of country. Some were humble, others were heroic, yet all were adventurous and felt free.","popularity":1.093,"poster_path":"/7ZQzxmb4cXABRdPHdHkV4R2NETg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gate #5","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
