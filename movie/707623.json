We meet Geh, founder of the band who taught himself to play the accordion 35 year ago. Geh is joined by Umar, a former Koran teacher and now a guitarist with a knack for Egyptian numbers. Fronting their band is Jamilah, a husky-voiced, humble diva who teaches the Koran during the day and sings Arabic songs at night while wondering if the world of melody can be both faith-bound and joyously secular.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9zzIoV8ggbUYU0VpRWpFDFnJXf1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":180672,"logo_path":null,"name":"Walad Dorleen Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"2010-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Baby Arabia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
