The Romaniotes became an integral part of the cultural mosaic of the city of Ioannina since the Byzantine era, but faced the danger of extinction during the harsh period of the Second World War. Narrating their history through time unfolds not only the story of the city, but of the whole country by and large.","popularity":0.602,"poster_path":"/2tv1qpC5lv8mWLVww3kDzvMUDh0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":115308,"logo_path":"/iC7hASZCmzAalV9ryDjzJLl5Vu6.png","name":"Cosmote TV","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2019-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Romaniotes, the Greek Jews of Ioannina","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
