Several ships, avoiding the dangerous travel around the whole of Peloponnese, were transferred from the Corinth Golf to the Golf of Saronikos, on top of an eight-wheel vehicle dragged along a stone-paved road (the “Diolkos”), almost parallel to the actual Corinth-Canal. The film describes several technical details of the whole operation, as well as various events such as the visits of the sailors to an ancient Greek Temple and to a tavern, where a hypothetically available Hydraulis (water organ) was played, or to a public fountain encountered along the Diolkos.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xjr74DpEV3i8u6nAJMLJCJwUw3y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134399,"logo_path":null,"name":"Technical Chamber of Greece","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2009-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Diolkos for 1,500 years","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
