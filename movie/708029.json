Their big dream: performing at the music festival in San Remo. An Italian tour could bring them to the next level. The days go by acrimoniously in rundown roadhouses; at night the duo plays dives along the Italian rustbelt. Not quite their image of bella Italia. Suddenly, this gamble seems completely insane. A 9 to 5 life would be so much easier. The crisis culminates when an unwelcome hitchhiker stumbles into their universe. As the dream threatens to shatter, the adventure begins.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xBLwKci7RPxNMBiTkDdcASwF1KL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134418,"logo_path":null,"name":"Farfan","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"San Remo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
