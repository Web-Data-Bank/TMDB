I didn’t know which temple to go to. I just wanted to find a temple. So, I choose another direction instead of going to the city. I walked from 4pm to 8 pm, it was gradually getting darker. With cars coming and going, I started walking aimlessly on the road…’  It is a project of a tracking record about a young man who planned to be a monk after 108 days. I got involved in the life of the protagonist, influenced some of his choices, and then I attempted to utilize subjective monologue to construct a narrative, coupled with his personal situation, his experience in the journey and his surroundings. ‘The Cassock’ is an intersection between the truly recorded video and non-fictional phone text. My interference of the events and supposition of its future progression are also included.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tq2Lb9wEW1mGBtfPGUZyLDMQkVH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2018-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cassock","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
