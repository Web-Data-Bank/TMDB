The cinematic journey begins in East Frisia along the coast, up the river Elbe to Hamburg and then to the North Frisian Islands to Sylt. So far, few international productions such as \"The Earth from Above\" or \"Home\" have only shown images from a bird's eye view. \"The North Sea from Above\" is the first German cinema film that dares to do so. With this film, Silke Schranz and Christian Wüstenberg want to show that the Wadden Sea, as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, is rightly on the same level as the Grand Canyon, the Serengeti or the Galápagos Islands.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oIvI6dH0cJt4JCYV2JRVUprdLWC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":130252,"logo_path":null,"name":"Comfilm.de","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2011-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die Nordsee von oben","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":4}
