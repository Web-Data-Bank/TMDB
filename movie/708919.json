A lot of people don't like them as a live act for this very reason, but if there are any disappointed punters in the crowd tonight, then they're keeping quiet. It takes a certain kind of band to move every member of the audience at the main stage; but everyone from the front row all the way back to the tents is on their feet, delighted and singing in anticipation, even before the Monkeys begin.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3ZnMAWzDxk1G6J5SdWV8imuWHu3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Arctic Monkeys: Live at Glastonbury 2007","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
