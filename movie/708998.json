A poetic and realist drama about duties, dreams and desires that draws you into the world of Kalyani. Kalyani is a young cook who lives with her ailing aunt and a young man in a rundown agraharam in Trivandrum. Each day is the same as she carries on with her life of duty as a cook and carer. But each day is not the same too. As the romance of poetry ignites a passion, as the stories of other worlds stirs a desire, as sharks close in and death draws near, Run Kalyani builds into an intense crescendo of grief and grit, sorrow and strength.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/n3ubWKkyIttneafIptdrDx3QRQj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2019-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malayalam","iso_639_1":"ml","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Run Kalyani","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
