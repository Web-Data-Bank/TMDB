Non-linear, dreamlike and spectral, Black Kites is a testament to artistry, imagination and the resiliency of the human psyche. Features sensitive performances by Steve Buscemi, Mimi Goese and Mira Furlan, a prominent actress from the former Yugoslavia, as the narrator.","popularity":0.804,"poster_path":"/iWKUZBAQPoCzzqT6WFmOs36nlUL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":547,"logo_path":null,"name":"Open City Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black Kites","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
