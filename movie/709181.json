The natural environment is poor, resources are scarce, and the hard-working and kind Hongyao people have lived here for more than 300 years. The mountains cut off contact with the outside world and cut off the 'pollution' of civilization. However, the impoverished children here do not give up their desire for knowledge. Despite difficult conditions and poor facilities, most children stay in school. In order to be able to provide children with books, parents cut down on food and clothing, and some children go to work-study programs at a young age. This film won grand prize at the 1995 Sichuan International Television Festival.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kBCpk0Hvbc7aBfG8zNCvxUNDzOe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-05-18","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dragon Ridge","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
