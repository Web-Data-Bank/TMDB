By his own admission, he felt Flaubert, Dostoevsky and Gogol as his \"blood brothers\", but he bequeathed to burn his manuscripts. However, friends violated the last will of the author. Kafka's works, filled with bizarre images and paradoxical plots, were published posthumously and brought him worldwide fame.
