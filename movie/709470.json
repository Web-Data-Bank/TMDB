'I figured they'd at least boo me off stage. Worst case scenario, they'd throw stuff at me.'  As it turned out, there was no booing or throwing.  And since that fateful maiden voyage, John has made lots of people laugh from coast to coast. On stage, he's energetic and contagiously enthusiastic about numerous topics including: Electronic cigarettes, Snuggies, automatic flushing toilets and the proper age to stop chewing your shoe in church. Born and raised in the heart of fly-over country, John is committed to \"comedy that won't leave a filthy residue.\" There's nothing in his act that you wouldn't want to hear your children repeat. (In fact, if your children repeat anything he says, send him a video copy of it...he'd love to see it!)  John resides in Kokomo, Indiana with his wife, Lori. He has four, grown children and six grandchildren (and counting)","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/csHZxl7SSf0e5AbFJwidskYxe9e.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"John Branyan: Demeaning of Life","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
