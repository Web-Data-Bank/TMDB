In 1989, Wen Pulin and Duan Jinchuan followed several monks up the mountain and took video of them. After three years, they revisited the same people and got a little closer to understanding their lives. As an in-depth dialogue with down-to-earth, rural people in Tibet, the film strives to understand Buddhism both as a philosophy, but also as a personal choice of lifestyle, as a transcendence of the chaos of life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pCXsbeh3SQsCzZRFSj9iklToKbK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sacred Site for Asceticism","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
