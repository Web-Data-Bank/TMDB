The film follows Antonio, Santiago and Oscar, three friends rooted deeply inside that soil, from where they are able to re-imagine ttheir lives and challenge the practical limitations of their social and historical circumstances.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unquiet Earth","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
