With the assistance of villagers, the reconstruction took 10 years. In 1995, they had admitted new members and founded a Mani Association. These old people chant Mani collectively for three days every month. In addition, following the ancient practice in the village, they pray for the safety of the villagers by piously worshiping the gods and making offerings to ghosts. But their ultimate purpose is to support any member to complete their final life journey by organizing a vigil and attending his or her funeral.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hBUKjjaJyoJFRnoebp89G1xtQjZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Elders","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
