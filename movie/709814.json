For a long period of time China was a country that did not like to discuss darkness or night. For decades the \"Red Sun\" was the most direct form of allowed imagination. Under today's sun office buildings and construction sights dominate one's vision. But in the evening everything changes, and you can see the spiritual life of the people. Evenings everywhere provide us with an opportunity to see ourselves, as through a mirror's reflection. In the evenings humanity is always more sensitive and vulnerable. In its darkness we are cloaked in intimacy and obscurity. All through the day, people work hard to put on and maintain appearances, and daytime resembles a stage on which people perform. Yet during the evening we are able to wander backstage.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/h0B7nTIqLrrHxZIcGkY2oxy2IkF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-07-27","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Night in China","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
