The title refers to the day it was made â€” September 23, 1969. Paik creates a stunning visual collage that fuses spontaneous, free-form experimentation with virtuosity and control. Paik manipulates and merges pure electronic abstractions, footage captured \"live\" from television, prerecorded material, and images recorded in the studio, including the faces of WGBH producers Fred Barzyk and Olivia Tappan. Exploring the interactivity of video and audio synthesizers, Paik processes these images with live and prerecorded sounds.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p28GyvPCw5L36cz9sS7BHnulZgs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"9/23/69: Experiment with David Atwood","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
