In this first symphony created specially for the dance company, Marco Antônio Guimarães, the author of anthological works such as 21 (1992) and Bach (1996), combines a sophisticated plot with original pieces and evocative musical passages from ballets recently produced by Grupo Corpo. The set of themes, written masterfully for the 90-member Philharmonic Orchestra of Minas Gerais, and interconnected by ingenious musical bridges performed by the Uakti group, allows Rodrigo Pederneiras to revisit the best works from the group’s entire repertoire, and also to process, with the experience accumulated through decades of working on detachment of form, a kind of synthesis of a choreographic scripture assembled over 34 years of residence at the company.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dança Sinfônica","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
