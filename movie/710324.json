The film, which frequently quotes from the writings of Raul Salvucci, is based on a sermon focused exclusively on the taboo subject of exorcism. The only thing connecting the priest with the outside world is a walk among the trees, which for a moment brings about a sense of calm free from temptation and obsession.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":32930,"logo_path":"/pk1mLuYxSmTWX0BdgzbHdUvRI5u.png","name":"FAMU","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Experience of an Exorcist","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
