Isolation in Auburn’s migrant community is a huge obstacle, and cultural norms mean that women are often tied to the house or a limited locale. Rosemary, with her larger-than-life spirit and generosity, works tirelessly to draw the women out of their homes and into society. She hosts a lively African Women’s Dinner Dance and takes them on a trip to the Blue Mountains and the NSW South Coast – introducing them to an Australia they’ve never seen before.","popularity":0.931,"poster_path":"/wD9IReoF9igIQnG7MkdO52IOXS9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134819,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bower Bird Films","origin_country":""},{"id":134820,"logo_path":null,"name":"Racing Pulse Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2020-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rosemary's Way","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2}
