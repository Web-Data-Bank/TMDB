Her Noise gathered international artists who use sound to investigate social relations, inspire action or uncover hidden soundscapes. The exhibition included newly commissioned works by Kim Gordon & Jutta Koether, Hayley Newman, Kaffe Matthews, Christina Kubisch, Emma Hedditch and Marina Rosenfeld. A parallel ambition of the project was to investigate music and sound histories in relation to gender, and the curators set out to create a lasting resource in this area.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Her Noise - The Making Of","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
