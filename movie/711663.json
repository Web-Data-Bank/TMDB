Broadcast live on 28 December 1964, this rare TV musical is one of few to have survived from the 1960s. A tale of Afro-Caribbean immigration, the show is unusual for its time in that it doesn't labour the issues around racial tensions in Britain, but simply celebrates Christmas and family.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wKDjdE5XCvLigD4ey87wKPv5luu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1964-12-28","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Rise and Fall of Nellie Brown","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
