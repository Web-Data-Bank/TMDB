The story involves an orphaned city boy named Simon Brent who comes to live on a 5000-acre sheep station called Wongadilla, in the Hunter Region, with his mother's second cousins, Edie and Charlie. In a remote valley on the property he discovers a variety of ancient Australian Aboriginal Dreamtime creatures. The arrival of heavy machinery intent on clearing the land brings to life the ominous stone Nargun. The Nargun is a creature drawn from tribal legends of the Gunai or Kurnai people of the area now known as the Mitchell River National Park in Victoria. Other creatures featured in the story include the mischievous green-scaled water-spirit Potkoorok, the Turongs (tree people) and the Nyols (cave people).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8ATYh8yVosTO2nEn8KRnGGlv0Rh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Nargun and the Stars","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
