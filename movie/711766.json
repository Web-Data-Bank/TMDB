Günter, the lord of the Rhine people, gives Siegfried a love potion that causes Siegfried to forget Brünnhilde and fall in love with Günter's sister Gutrane. Siegfried has given Brünnhilde the Ring as a token of their love, but her Valkyrie sister urges her to destroy it, because their father Wotan has lost his spear and power and is hiding out in Valhalla. Instead, Brünnhilde keeps it, and under the influence of the potion, Siegfried steals it from her. Enraged, Brünnhilde helps Alberich's son murder Siegfried, but Siegfried's memory returns, and he dies thinking of Brünnhilde. Brünnhilde repents and orders a funeral pyre to be built. She rides into the fire herself, and the Rhinemaidens get the ring back. The story closes with flames flickering about Valhalla in the background.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tW1V0su2PzP65lMC8PYDV9DQaUi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":278,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The end and a new beginning","title":"Gotterdammerung","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
