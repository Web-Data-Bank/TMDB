Reflecting briefly upon her circumstance in the hospital, she realizes that nothing has been solved, whereupon she vacates the premises, wearing nothing but a hospital gown, a black coat, and flimsy sandals. Shortly thereafter, at a bus station, she requests from the attendant a bus ticket to wherever, with consideration to the limited funds she has to spare. The attendant insists on a destination, or even a direction - Kate spins about, points, and says, \"that way\". The story then evolves to include Barry Tubb, her love interest, who rekindles her will to live.","popularity":1.834,"poster_path":"/5aXFUyR6LMdFNPYshS7HiZpclMb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Can you love a complete stranger?","title":"Warm Summer Rain","video":false,"vote_average":4.4,"vote_count":9}
