The two men, who have worked together for more than 40 years, are devoted to protecting their country's visual memories. Home to some 13,000 films, the archive preserves pivotal moments of Sudan's turbulent history and is one of the largest in Africa. But the archive is in a fragile state. Following years of neglect and poor storage, many film reels are turning to dust in Sudan's unforgiving tropical climate. The two friends are determined to turn it around and embark on a mission to save the old films. Will they succeed in preserving Sudan's visual history for future generations before it's too late?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tbkv4ARHqB11ZzsYBlSQRWpwYq3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135049,"logo_path":null,"name":"Basma Films","origin_country":""},{"id":131334,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Five","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SD","name":"Sudan"}],"release_date":"2017-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sudan's Forgotten Films","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
