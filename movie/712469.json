Juxtaposing \"documentary\" takes on a fashion shoot with footage of semiologist Sylvère Lotringer giving an impromptu lecture on Mallarmé on a frozen lake, Hell Frozen Over maintains an ambiguous stance from which to both critique and celebrate the power of surface.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":135101,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Bohen Foundation","origin_country":""},{"id":135105,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Bernadette Corporation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hell Frozen Over","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
