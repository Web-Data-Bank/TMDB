Winter became a signature Russian feature just as much as the “secret Russian soul.” This season is praised by the greatest Russian authors, musicians, and painters. Our film will show how people and winter interact now, in the 21st century, across vast expanses of Russia. The audience will be given a chance to travel through a full cycle of winter and follow all the changes happening to the flora & fauna, and even to human nature.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":135228,"logo_path":null,"name":"Line Up","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Winter","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
