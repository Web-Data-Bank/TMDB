The creators of the film focus on a unique period in the history of world cinema - the post-war \"thaw\" euphoria and the time of great hopes, the key character of which was the author of \"War and Peace\". What was this man and cinematographer who shot both chamber dramas and megalomaniac battle projects? And how did he, the winner of many USSR awards, manage to become a figure of world significance and a link between the two superpowers during the Cold War era?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lhI4pgdY8C1pBxONwGJKZAMrGbt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":135272,"logo_path":null,"name":"24K","origin_country":""},{"id":3451,"logo_path":"/53lT8VOQ9JDiPGYLvjgO42Av58I.png","name":"Art Pictures Studio","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":134116,"logo_path":"/s3JTlXPJgR9fdJ7u0GoPePGr8jz.png","name":"National Media Group","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2021-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bondarchuk.
