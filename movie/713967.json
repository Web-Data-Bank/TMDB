Hork!","overview":"Taking its title from a scene in James Joyce's Finnegans Wake, in which Finnegan awakens from a dream, Hark! Hork! evokes natural and subconscious landscapes. Infusing the work with Joycean language and imagery, Gillette creates a visual and aural parallel to Joyce's stream-of-consciousness text. Melding abstracted, organic forms with dreamlike, beautifully composed still lifes, he creates a collage of thoughts, gestures and objects that contemplates the sensuality of nature and the fleeting nature of memory. This work reveals a complexity of formal strategy and a sophistication of editing exceptional for its time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/d1Sxhf0E17FnDH6ztP2bAqw47GK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hark!
