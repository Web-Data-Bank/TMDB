All the veins are drying without the blood running through them. I came to Barão Geraldo because things happen here.  Here people love as much as dolls hang themselves and chicken are slaughtered to death. Would I still hang dolls and burn memories in the next 18 years? It astonishes me how less and less I do not care for things that are not my extension. Being my own destruction is the only way. Intimacy is a farewell. All I see is a lot water and all the colors are not enough. All forms of comunication are not enough for a lot of water.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lQkRzQke8zDRzFGGVuLotqTBzM0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2013-12-30","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"I came to Barão Geraldo because things happen here.","title":"Colors","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
