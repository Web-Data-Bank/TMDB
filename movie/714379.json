Danger comes from poachers, who hunt for bear fur and bile, which is believed to heal. Danger comes from illegal hunting centers, enslaving baby animals for dog training. Yet a human becomes stronger not through a struggle or hunt — but… love. And care — for a bear. ‘’Land of Bears’’ is a film about the country, where love between a man and bear is mutual.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cbYAQxTDEa4GERFrv2DxWfWd8qM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":104460,"logo_path":"/iCTuwRWJYHmreIEAaYicHqEqEBN.png","name":"Format TV","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2019-04-18","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Land of Bears","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
