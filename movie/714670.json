It takes the move of the school in 2018 as an opportunity to capture the contradictions between artistic and economic interests in post-reunification Berlin and in the present. After the end of the GDR, the school was threatened with extinction: the building was dilapidated, Berlin was broke, the search for a new location threatened to fail. The students themselves finally fought their way to the new location under the motto \"Bitte nach Mitte!\" (\"Letâ€™s move to the center\").","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pB9Jc8QjwytmQb8t1dz27vWi8NK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2019-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bitte nach Mitte!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
