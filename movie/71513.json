Special attention has been paid to the BBC’s ‘Conspiracy Files’ programme which aired on BBC 2, February 18th 2007 and omitted hardcore evidence proving 9/11 was an inside job. ‘911 and the British Broadcasting Conspiracy’ demolishes the weak attempt by the BBC to cover up the truth behind 9/11 and exposes their foreknowledge of the collapse of WTC building 7, when they reported the event 20 minutes before the building came down.","popularity":1.581,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2007-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"911 and the British Broadcasting Conspiracy","video":true,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":2}
