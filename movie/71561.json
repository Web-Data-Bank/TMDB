The mother is incapable of mature behaviour when problems arise. When the mother forgets to fetch Eva at school in her car, Eva does not know the way home. Panicking and crying she just runs and is overrun by a car. The driver is obviously innocent. He is a second-hand bookseller (Etienne) and a mountain climber and has a phenomenal memory. The hospital cannot tell whether Eva will ever wake up from her coma, or will speak or move.","popularity":1.081,"poster_path":"/hpFVXBk5ziPdhRzEXep3PeyqpYF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Girl from the Chartreuse","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":7}
