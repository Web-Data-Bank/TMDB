For Maori women receiving their traditional moko kauae, they are visually asserting their birthright and identity while celebrating the mana (spiritual power) of their whakapapa (ancestry). In Maori tradition, the head is considered the most tapu (sacred) part of the human body making the practice of moko kauae highly prestigious and exclusive to Maori women. Director Hiona Henare brings us into an uninhibited and unobstructed experience filled with traditional songs and story.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ruahine: Stories In Her Skin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
