It talks about everything and anything.  We see a donkey, two sheeps. We see lots of goats there, including François, whom we know in Laval under the name of \"The bald one\". François goes from house to house to question people about democracy. Dialogues are formed, sometimes unraveled.  We still wonder.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pZrCJXqFOAryWH04jNynwsrqAVP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Documentary","title":"N'importe qui","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
