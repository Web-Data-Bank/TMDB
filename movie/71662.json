The man and the prospective mother-in-law eventually start to like each other, and he makes every effort to be liked by the daughter. With the intervention of a fantasy granddaughter, quasi-miraculous healing, and a lot of hilarious repartee in between, the movie has a happy ending.","popularity":0.861,"poster_path":"/y5BxwUR2MF5Lp3ghXKlDUDVwrQB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21578,"logo_path":null,"name":"NTV-Profit","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":170204,"logo_path":"/3EP1gJYMGlEt7j17naPMg5e2LH2.png","name":"Gorky Film Studios","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2000-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Come Look at Me","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":16}
