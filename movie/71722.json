They want Togawa to hijack an armored truck loaded with 120 million yen; their leverage is to promise him money for surgery for Rie. Togawa consents and plans the heist with three others.

Can Togawa escape with enough money to help his sister and ensure a passage out of Japan?","popularity":1.403,"poster_path":"/wobDzcGe4i2WzF4HBAPif3kACrg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":955,"logo_path":"/5xnXD3PJI1HqOJceSAKZ3fDqO1V.png","name":"Nikkatsu Corporation","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1964-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cruel Gun Story","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":15}
