In these maternities for the rich called the ‘Lebensborn’, the Nazis raised ‘perfect’ children born of progenitors from the SS and women with well defined racial grounds. This plan gave birth to thousands of children who were called ‘Hitler's Children’. They were supposed to lead the world one day. It wasn’t until 30 years later that the existence of one of these centers in France was discovered. For the very first time, the children born in the ‘Lesenborn’ in Lamorlaye find out about their existence and disclose one the most frightening plans of History, as well as the dark secret of their origins.","popularity":0.668,"poster_path":"/dpZ1E5ErUsftECHtfqRXAYEy74y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10323,"logo_path":"/uMlnpzZGM0rWxp69JU5cuAQEJbB.png","name":"Gedeon Programmes","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":69146,"logo_path":"/ouC923wOM8TaiO5sEDNiVQYxD08.png","name":"RMC Découverte","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":11244,"logo_path":"/gCHH1xt3dKjlm9NuMPF9ekpPWD6.png","name":"France 3","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hitler's Children","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
