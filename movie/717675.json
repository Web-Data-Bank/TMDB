They have become a couple who no longer look at nor touch one another, and who have made daily fighting the essence of their relationship. This evening, Ana has invited their upstairs neighbors to come round, Salva and Laura, a couple younger than them, pleasant and friendly, but whose noises are now an annoyance for Julio and Ana... or perhaps a stimulus? The upstairs neighbors will make them an unusual and surprising proposal which will turn the evening into an exaggerated and cathartic experience for all four.","popularity":5.371,"poster_path":"/ukhbDB4hvCbx3HBsEVL65w9NP2k.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14033,"logo_path":null,"name":"Imposible Films","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":35559,"logo_path":"/xLqNfq5xXETBKjq3jSSiNqqPiN7.png","name":"ICEC","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":67412,"logo_path":"/vgVqq5hunVs8GN5Je9d9rG7Q2NU.png","name":"Movistar+","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2020-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Love The Neighbour Has Just Taken On A Whole New Meaning!","title":"The People Upstairs","video":false,"vote_average":6.106,"vote_count":80}
