It focuses especially on surgeons in the persons of Professor Valiotti (Gabriele Ferzetti) and Dr. Giordani (Enrico Maria Salerno). Many of the scenes are based on Italian news stories of the period ('70s) which recount the suffering and high costs of unnecessary or overly aggressive treatment motivated by academic ambitions or simple greed.","popularity":3.762,"poster_path":"/2EsXksYefPSyhMzHcFrQwNROpU0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53915,"logo_path":null,"name":"Roberto Loyola Cinematografica","origin_country":""},{"id":83303,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rewind Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1973-08-25","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hospitals: The White Mafia","video":false,"vote_average":6.375,"vote_count":8}
