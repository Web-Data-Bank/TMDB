Adapting from a plot that has been infiltrated into the blood and blood of many Vietnamese people with the spirit of respect for identity but also needing novelty is a big challenge for the film crew The War with the Elves. Based on the famous fairy tale, the film has built a fictional plot. While the country was at peace, the invaders and King Hung's army had to confront a mighty opponent. In that critical situation, Thach Sanh appeared as a savior hero. Still faithful to the original plot when letting the hero save the princess, but not from the evil eagle but dangerous enemies. However, the higher task of Thach Sanh is to destroy the ogre to save the whole country from the invasion.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/a0n9i9oUKYbpU9a8xUcuwajdtbm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":146428,"logo_path":null,"name":"Golden Eye Movies","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"VN","name":"Vietnam"}],"release_date":"2014-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Vietnamese","iso_639_1":"vi","name":"Tiếng Việt"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cuộc Chiến Với Chằn Tinh","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
