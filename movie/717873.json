For the film it is a closing. For her character it is less clear. Is it a refusal? A denial? A shying away from? An admission of guilt or not caring? A disappearing act? In 2017 on the streets of Berlin, twenty-three women, friends and passersby, reverse Seberg’s action.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iTQU4z04AhYI8juwfFMhbHyTNOF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Turn","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
