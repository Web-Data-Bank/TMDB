Archival footage from the orgiastic 1995 tour with The Oblivians and stories of everyday life leads the audience down a familiar path, and with a delicately insistent grin, transports us somewhere else completely. Echoing the artistic path taken by Ben Wallers, the film winds through the underground world of the 1990's garage rock band Country Teasers to form a portrait of a man, musician, and leader.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/omQ9MsUCABGiTZ4EMTQbO4e4X0H.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This Film Should Not Exist","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
