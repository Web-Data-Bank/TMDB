The production fulfilled a fervent wish of principal conductor Marc Albrecht. The music of Gurre-Lieder is timeless, and so is its subject: a passionate, yet forbidden love. The story harks back to a Scandinavian saga, situated in Gurre. King Waldemar loves the girl Tove, who is a mysterious character, connected to both the world of people and the world of birds. The queen is jealous and has Tove killed. The Wood Dove tells of this in a moving song and the king accuses God of cruelty. A nightmarish scene follows, of a fierce army killed in battle, which rampages like a horde of ghosts. The radiant dawn at the end of Gurre-Lieder shows the insignificance of human destiny compared to the power of nature.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nOlnG6GKOnIucBshu17hmIz9ya8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113783,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dutch National Opera","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Schönberg: Gurre-Lieder","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
