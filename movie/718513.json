But don't his persuasive words mar the pure idea that Moses finds so impossible to put into words?  In Schönberg's unfinished opus magnum, Barrie Kosky recounts the Israelites' exodus - with almost 200 performers on stage - as a parable of humanity's never-ending search for answers. The Russian star conductor Vladimir Jurowski returns to his former workplace, the Komische Oper Berlin, to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dgj3oumnIwrAlvI9h5844vPIWDX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Moses und Aron - KOB","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
