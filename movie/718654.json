South Africa Uncensored is a raw and gritty piece of black-and-white agitprop, full of firsthand testimonial footage of the appalling conditions endured by Black South Africans under apartheid. The film portrays the filth in Black shantytowns lacking proper sewage systems, the country's segregated public spaces, and the vile white leisure spectacle of enjoying forced fisticuffs between Black workers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xHVmkWcbOFccgKcWIoPEHdtvOjQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1951-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"South Africa Uncensored","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
