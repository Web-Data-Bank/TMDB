The pair is overwhelmed by all the colorful characters around them telling them what to do. They go to strenuous and humorous efforts to make Tamio’s wedding an event to remember.","popularity":1.77,"poster_path":"/nrhiC7Cg95O18anDPPaZm3VDCPp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2928,"logo_path":null,"name":"stylejam","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":7967,"logo_path":"/4W9ByL6mMDn9UOHh8oGD36l3BnN.png","name":"Media Factory","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":6348,"logo_path":null,"name":"Be-Wild","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2008-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Then Summer Came","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
