The Bible prophesies that a staggering army of 200 million demons will be released from the bottomless pit in the last days.

In fact, occult teachings in Freemasonry and other secret societies proclaim the coming of a mysterious Planet X, code-named Sirius, the Dog Star. The Illuminati say that when it comes, this star will bring both catastrophe and salvation to earth, ending in an alien invasion by extraterrestrials who shall reign as gods over all mankind","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2001-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Planet X - Dark Red Star on a Collision Course With Earth","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
