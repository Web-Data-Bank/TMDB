That woman was Fannie Davis, Bridgett M. Davis’s mother.  Part bookie, part banker, mother, wife, and granddaughter of slaves, Fannie ran her numbers business for thirty-four years, doing what it took to survive in a legitimate business that just happened to be illegal. She created a loving, joyful home, sent her children to the best schools, bought them the best clothes, mothered them to the highest standard, and when the tragedy of urban life struck, soldiered on with her stated belief: “Dying is easy. Living takes guts.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":127929,"logo_path":"/fCB4AVYvxxDvqumgYqsN6ehyN3G.png","name":"Searchlight Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"The World According To Fannie Davis","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
