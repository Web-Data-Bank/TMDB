By contrasting the creative paths of these artists, and a connection between them by the world renowned Kronos Quartet, the film explores music not as a form of entertainment, career, or even self-expression, but as a tool to develop more deeply meaningful relationships with people and the complexities of the world they live in.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oj9gn2Of4FZAwibNY0fSixRQmOi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110685,"logo_path":null,"name":"Candela Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Reach of Resonance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
