On the surface, they are a happy couple.  Without telling him, a few years ago she took out a loan with Krogstad.

Nora sees their relationship crumble and her illusions shatter â€“ leading to a life-changing decision.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nXNn8CNsaw87DJwqL4U1NN2YAiO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":133623,"logo_path":null,"name":"English National Ballet","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nora: English National Ballet","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
