Ever have a job that made you ponder \"this place would be fun if it didn't suck so much\"? Welcome to food-service hell. Natalie, the waitress, is on the verge of a nervous breakdown. Her social life is in turmoil, and the endless barrage of customers just won't give her a break. Clint, the manager, isn't exactly a people-person. He's lewd, rude, and totally insensitive... until you get to know him. Kevin, the busboy, is a nice guy with a dark brooding secret. He's quirky and artistic, but don't light a match near this powder keg! Throw a couple of wise cracking trash-talkers and some inept thieves into the mix, and this is sure to be one night you'll never forget.","popularity":0.974,"poster_path":"/p1FuF7HCPLGt3xar0oaT8nQMyrX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75460,"logo_path":null,"name":"Random Reel Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Ever have one of those nights where nothing seems to be going right?
