My mother did not want children.  She wanted to free herself from domestic contingencies.  She became a civil servant and a city dweller.  All my life, I had to deal with this aversion that she transmitted to me.  Having chosen to live in the countryside, I find myself in my turn monopolized by my home.  It is from my kitchen and my computer screen that I reconstruct our women's journeys under the influence of household and family obligations.  My grandmother carried buckets of water with a yoke every day.  Today my friends are coming back to washable diapers.  I summon people, places and archives to question my intimate history by dialoguing with Michelle Perrot, historian of women's emancipation.","popularity":1.095,"poster_path":"/tom4xBwcyKsBblQXq4jTkG0YZzw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":177250,"logo_path":null,"name":"Airelles Vidéo","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":76613,"logo_path":null,"name":"A Vif Cinémas","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Femme de mère en fille","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
