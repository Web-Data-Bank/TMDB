An isolated systems manager who's skin, the only thing that still embraces his body is starting to fall off because of a chronic lack of physical contact. To find a solution he will have to go way out of his comfort zone: from hugging therapy to visiting prostitutes. All the while with the clock ticking. As a systems manager, he knows how to connect everybody using his computer network, but making a personal connection is something he just can't do.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dqb6rnksAfQ6PQLcV6uPQ6ABqol.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2017-06-27","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Skinache","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
