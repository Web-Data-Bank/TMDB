It depicts the artist entering a closet, suspending herself from a hanger, and closing the door. Parente used video as a political tool to protest the military dictatorship in Brazil, and to comment on the mass torture committed by the government. Much of her work concerned domestic space and its association with conventional roles to which women were expected to conform. Several videos by Parente transform daily household tasks into forms of resistance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9o9EjPsqklY7XgdVww4t9qEXRZj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
