Before leaving to find his daughter, Louisiane, whom he hasn't seen in 15 years, the police officer is given a routine mission by his chief: to watch over a supermarket that is the scene of a major cash transfer. As a gunfight breaks out with the robbers, Blaney sees the two cashiers, Liliane and Malika, running away with the store's takings. He decides to follow them, even if it means missing his train. Very quickly, in the presence of the two young women, his paternal instinct will incite him to stay with them and help them to return to the right path.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-01-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Un flic presque parfait","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
