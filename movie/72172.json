The rabbi explains Joseph that due to the celebrations this time of the year, if Nora is not buried that same day, they should wait at least 5 days for the funeral. Nora had planned before his death, a Machiavellian plan in order that Joseph was the one who has to take care of his funeral. But Nora forgot a small detail, a mysterious photograph stored under her bed, that will remind Joseph that the greatest love stories, sometimes are hidden in the smallest places.","popularity":1.949,"poster_path":"/pDviOAe987MuWeb4QIGGOqVtF2q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70131,"logo_path":"/sjk7jCba2sCvkkWz3Ms5busho5D.png","name":"Cacerola Films","origin_country":"MX"},{"id":16116,"logo_path":null,"name":"FIDECINE","origin_country":"MX"},{"id":299,"logo_path":"/elssmtHcogGtF8Gxokh9phZvLKi.png","name":"Instituto Mexicano de Cinematografía","origin_country":"MX"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2008-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nora's Will","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":13}
