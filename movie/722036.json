He receives both warm welcomes and accusations of commercialising religion. This challenge becomes Rhomaâ€™s struggle. He tries to persuade his fellow professionals to avoid drinking and women. He also manages to help his future father-in-law who almost rapes Laila, his own daughter, in a drunken state. Despite opposition from the Al Muthainah college, Rhoma manages to convince them that music can be used as a means of preaching. Rhoma sings no less than seven preachy dangdut songs in this film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vxJ0KLMxHIEr2TbNfORXyUwVKPq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125065,"logo_path":null,"name":"PT Rhoma Irama Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"1980-02-14","revenue":0,"runtime":127,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Perjuangan dan Doa","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
