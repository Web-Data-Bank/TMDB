Bark-Rind was shot totally single-frame...each shot exposed three times...close-up, mid shot, long shot. I used the sound of insects, signifying pollination, life...and I tried to make their sound visible. The camera starts on the grass, flowers, then works its way up the trunk, into the crown of the tree, then onto the next tree. The film vibrates...switching from sound/film...film/sound. You wonder whether you're looking at a film image or at the sound itself.” (Paul Winkler)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dHLddroDEnXTMMNAR4aEKsvYccR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1977-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bark-Rind","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
