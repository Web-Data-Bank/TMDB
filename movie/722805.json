And a transfer student, Yotchi, also gets along with them because she has a similar background, which is that they come from not such a good home environment. They spent their school life supporting each other. But, at the age of 20, Yotchi disappeared. Then Lisa, the daughter of a politician and a top model, appears in front of the two men. Makoto takes an unusual romantic interest in Lisa, who lives in a different world from them, and asked her out to dinner, but she does not take him up on it at all. Kida warns Makoto to give up on her because they live in different worlds, but Makoto quits his job and vanishes without a trace.","popularity":2.792,"poster_path":"/sdhtSyvEsuh7MjlGIBjrlIdaLkw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":55938,"logo_path":"/ku5PUEwBjUx8XaYikgaXRVLIMbb.png","name":"avex pictures","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2021-01-29","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A proposal spanning 10 years.
