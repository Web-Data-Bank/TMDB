It's brilliant, funny, unnerving, confrontational, disturbing stuff; you haven't lived 'til you've seen a small platoon of nude, armed, and dangerous Douglas clones poised for action.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"RIFF 1&2","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
