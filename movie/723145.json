We first meet two English builders, employed to replace the garden fence, temporarily removing the barrier between the house and a Pakistani neighbour.  This introduces the film’s central theme of hospitality which ultimately finds its expression when a homeless Slovakian man charms the Filmmaker’s Colombian cleaner to let him in and tests everyone's ideas of the expectations and boundaries between host and guests.","popularity":1.936,"poster_path":"/h0qGHQMhoNDfbWVLORhFMVNSNCR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75163,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bungalow Town Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Filmmaker's House","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
