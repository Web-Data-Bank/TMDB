Thus the action opens in the beautiful 16th century church of Sant'Andrea della Valle at noon, where Cavaradossi (Domingo) is painting a portrait, moves to the Farnese Palace that evening where Tosca (Malfitano) dramatically stabs the lustful Scarpia (Raimondi) and finally in the battlements of Castel Sant'Angelo at dawn the following day where the last moments of the drama are completed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tW98gnqZzXP6fhDmcThtzn9loop.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":45801,"logo_path":null,"name":"Warner Classics","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-05-22","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tosca","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
