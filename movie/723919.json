Platt plays acting coach Angelo (who got circumcised for a role he didn’t get) while Galvin plays dance teacher Bradley “Baby” Bjorn, whose instructions include the cat-like jump “Grizabella!” and works a side gig as Millie Bobbie Brown’s stand-in for Stranger Things. The short also pokes fun at the lack of funding in the arts, Stomp, and vocal warm-ups.","popularity":0.605,"poster_path":"/kjfnN5YLUCam6v3tXdzD5Rk2f8v.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Theater Camp","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
