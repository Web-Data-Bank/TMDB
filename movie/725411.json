From the artistsâ€™ statement: Anathema re-imagines the microscopic behavior of liquid crystals undergoing turbulence as a sentient entity that possesses the fingertips and the eyes enthralled by the LCD touch-screens of communicative capitalism. Anathema can be understood as an object-oriented video that isolates and recombines the magical gestures of dream factory capitalism. By bringing the telecommunicating couplings of mother-father-daughter-son-machines and boyfriend-girlfriend-units into contact with the conductive imagery of liquid crystallization, Anathema proposes itself as a prototype for a counter-spell assembled from the possible worlds of capitalist sorcery.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vjJauQLcAeCyjwYqC29IdglKu2l.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anathema","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
