He can do no good, say no good and can possibly be up to no good. On top of all this generic incompetence, he has created himself a blood rival â€“ his cousin, Bhatkai. Bhatkai wants the ancestral home they live in all for himself, and using his un-Malhar-like qualities of competence and deception, makes life hell for poor Malhar and his parents. Bhatkai and his parents not only try to drive them away from their ancestral home by appointing tantriks, but they also appoint Guti, a female snatcher, to make their purpose more effective. Will Guti manage to wreck Malhar and drive him away from his own house?
