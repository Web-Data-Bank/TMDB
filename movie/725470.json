Lyz, has the body as the main work support and her daily performance as a research platform revealing the mismatch between what is said, what is done, discourse and practice. For the lack of authorization, for the intrusion, for the unwanted inclusion, questioning the free school that does not allow to be freed, the art gallery that does not include the non-salable, the institutional space that assimilates the transgression since it has already been incorporated by the system.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jLEtUJdJL826BqkO4BrA14IdykW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2020-07-02","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lyz Parayzo Artist of The End of The World","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
