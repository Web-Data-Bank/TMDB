Like Cleveland itself, the Bend is a place where the possibility of sudden disaster is never far. Collision Bend is also home to Quicken Loans Arena, site of the 2016 Republican National Convention. It was here that 2,472 delegates gathered to elect Donald Trump their nominee for President. COLLISION BEND explores the tension between this event and its setting — the often-absurd politics of our time and the often-harsh reality of the lives most affected by them. It is an intimate portrait of a city and its people bearing witness to American history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kjGVDcMY3QVG6MbjRJ61kl2eURY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Collision Bend","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
