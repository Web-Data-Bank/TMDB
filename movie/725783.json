Their shtick was exceptionally slick back then: four years on, with Rodgers cancer-free and fresh from volunteering at Grenfell Tower, it’s slicker still.  Rodgers has a back catalogue preposterously over-stuffed with sublime music: the latterday Chic’s skill is presenting it as a kind relentless, mind-boggling barrage, without slipping into wedding disco cheesiness. There are obviously omissions – there’s no room for Dance Dance Dance, My Forbiden Lover or Thinking of You, but it seems fairly churlish to quibble in the face of a set that steamrollers the Pyramid stage crowd: We Are Family, Le Freak, Good Times, Get Lucky, Upside Down, Let’s Dance. The crowd’s response is pretty delirious, but that seems only fitting.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8QdarSjqybbR0Z1VZGlFPVRUOT2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nile Rodgers and Chic: Live at Glastonbury 2017","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
