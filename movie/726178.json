The sound refers to the roar of social unrest (riots, demonstrations, guerrillas). The aim of this project is to combine the vibrations and trajectories of the universe with those related to social upheavals in a kind of « chaosmos ». It is perhaps in this « internal identity of the world and chaos », in James Joyce's words, that all the resonances and arrangements of stars and men reveal their common determinations, whether they are driven by objective or subjective forces.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6SklT7evQxIptzlcd1jamTNIYI2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guérilla-Hubble","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
