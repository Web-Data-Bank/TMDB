On the ship, Verna meets the friendly and charming Grace, and the seemingly ordinary Bob, an unaccompanied man in his mid-sixties who inherited a family business, although he doesn’t have a fraction of Verna’s elegance and wit, Bob tries to seduce her. But he might not be the foolish yet harmless man he initially appears to be, and his presence troubles Verna. As wounds and humiliations from her past resurface, the smooth atmosphere of the cruise will be disturbed by Verna’s quiet, yet shocking act of vengeance.","popularity":0.654,"poster_path":"/kl9coSeUhu12Z3V5ZloPKbyJnRs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20580,"logo_path":"/oRR9EXVoKP9szDkVKlze5HVJS7g.png","name":"Amazon Studios","origin_country":"US"},{"id":113521,"logo_path":"/fF4xLqMQ0C6Laql7HpzRnvn8hfi.png","name":"StudioCanal","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":6705,"logo_path":"/e8EXNSfwr5E9d3TR8dHKbQnQK4W.png","name":"Film4 Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Stone Mattress","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
