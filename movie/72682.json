With her father close to retirement, Rebecca returns to her family's wildlife-friendly farm in Devon, to become the next generation to farm the land. But last year's high fuel prices were a wake-up call for Rebecca. Realising that all food production in the UK is completely dependent on abundant cheap fossil fuel, particularly oil, she sets out to discover just how secure this oil supply is. Alarmed by the answers, she explores ways of farming without using fossil fuel. With the help of pioneering farmers and growers, Rebecca learns that it is actually nature that holds the key to farming in a low-energy future.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ryYdzZAzmh4Bta76tISSlgcF0lo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Farm for the Future","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
