The group had the intention of illegally hopping trains from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific but with little idea of how to do it. All Aboard compares the trial-and-error process that comes with riding freight, filming skateboarding, and living without shelter, all while experiencing the comradery of skateboard culture across the United States.
