Challenged by the illegal nature of their passions, dangerous locales, and the pressures of a society that will not accept or understand them, these artists reveal what drives them to return, time after time, to execute their artwork on a canvas that is forever changing, moving and vanishing into oblivion.  Both snapshot of a fading history and love-letter to the trains themselves, Year-round Metal Enjoyment captures the voices, faces and thoughts of artists, railfans and train-workers alike, while showcasing the unlikely beauty of the trains in their environment.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iVxIBaUoCQPHAelwrPBiQRoNZzi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A New England freight train experience","title":"Year-round Metal Enjoyment","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
