These radically new dances created circumstances for the performers’ direct, non-stylistic actions. Each of the pieces was performed in a different place in the loft, with the audience moving from location to location to view them. Some of the pieces required elementary structures – a hanging rope, rectangular wooden boxes – which were placed throughout the loft like a sculptural installation. In 2004 the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles invited Forti to re-create these dance constructions at the Geffen Contemporary space, in conjunction with the exhibition A Minimalist Future? Art as Object 1958 – 1986.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/s8NVQnDJ6djNWk5VU1Xj1shyB4j.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Simone Forti: An Evening of Dance Constructions","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
