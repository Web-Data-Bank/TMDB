Framed by the seasons, Mi Chacra chronicles one year in Feliciano’s life, from the planting season in his community to the harvest, and through a season of work on the Inca Trail. The film paints a vivid picture of this man’s world, of the conflict between his love of the land and the work he has learned from his father, and the desire to see his son living what he sees as a better life in the city.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wReJE8OYOAnpDcnGMYRzKgfQeyk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":168662,"logo_path":null,"name":"Devolution Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PE","name":"Peru"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Quechua","iso_639_1":"qu","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Land","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
