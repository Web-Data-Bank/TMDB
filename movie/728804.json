The act of self-sacrifice for the sake of a child that absorbs all the time and leaves no space neither for consumption, nor for satisfactions or vanity, becomes a chance for a devoted woman in a state of the physical and emotional exhaustion to reach the transcendental state close to spiritual ecstasy. Lacking resources for a proper functioning, her organism starts disassociating information and enters into a seeming madness, when the brain is unable to control thought process as usual, and because of a total focus solely on a child, all the rest in the world ceases to be of any importance, freeing her from everything excessive and superfluous.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dLDm6Zb20w8A0HvqFo7YisPeA46.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2019-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maternité","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
