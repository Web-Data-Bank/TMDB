In the lives of Anton (Mårble), Stas (DJ 1985) and mark (Mississippi Landscapes) there are performances at the Boiler Room and Present Perfect — and urban weekdays with \"Pyaterochka\" and canteens, strange parties, jams on the roof panels, escapes to the village. In the gap between them, there is a lot of talk about music, creativity, and what allows them to remain themselves and not look for ways into the mainstream.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uURvJKLLNbeBm2UrylX8X7ztGPj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2020-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Landscapes of Rivers (And Other Ways to Speak with Yourself)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
