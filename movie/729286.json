Seeking for some recognition, he decides to write a play for four characters; a one-performance only, where all actors have to die onstage. On that matter, he casts an old has-been actor, who is an alcoholic, a fat actress, an endearing and intellectually disabled boy and a black actor, who has only been cast for the color of his skin. The play brings on a media hype never seen before, is an instant success and everyone is eager for the opening night. Whit defenders and detractors, the whole country talks about Leonardo Oviedo, and he will be willing to get to the very end, to fulfill this sickening artistic ideal.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fVzhLbczeQakXHTLt6favzXFrDG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16898,"logo_path":null,"name":"AMA Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PE","name":"Peru"}],"release_date":"2020-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wake Show","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
