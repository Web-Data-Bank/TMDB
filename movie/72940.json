BLAME IT ON THE FISH documents the tour in typical Primus (i.e. weird) fashion with an appropriately bizarre collection of live-performance clips, interviews, and behind-the-scenes footage, as well as bonus material that includes a \"futuristic\" mockumentary that reimagines the band 60 years into the future.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gw7sxrLLr6KKnP34uPyZUshYbpg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":171575,"logo_path":null,"name":"Frizzle Fry, Inc.","origin_country":""},{"id":171577,"logo_path":null,"name":"Powers Philms","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Primus - Blame It On The Fish","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":2}
