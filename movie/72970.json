Worry not, though, Ralph fans: instead of steering the world-class story spinner behind such all-ages gems as \"Kid Astro\" and \"Old Red No. 7\" in a clumsy corporate direction, the label elected to distill 16 of his best and brightest tracks from the six previous Ralph's World discs. Thus we're essentially treated to a greatest-hits package: \"Surfin' in My Imagination,\" \"At the Bottom of the Sea,\" \"Sunny Day Rainy Day Anytime Band,\" and \"The Coffee Song\" all make the cut, and they're as zippy-joyful-plucky as ever.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Welcome To Ralph's World DVD","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
