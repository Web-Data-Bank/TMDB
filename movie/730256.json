Grandpa Spirit is a powerful shaman, well known for helping the poor and downtrodden in the neighbourhood. When Marla, a 16-year-old overprotected and lonely girl with congenital heart problems comes to Grandpa Spirit for help, she is surprised and amused to find Ze, an awkward 17-year-old teenager, underneath the fearsome dressing of the shaman. She beats him at video games and teases him with sexually graphic manga books. Ze is entranced.  The teens find in each other outlets for repressed hormones and first-time experiences. In between stolen kisses, Ze carries out his duty as the comforter to the lost people of the city. When Marla dies, Ze faces the ephemeral nature of life and love, as well as the limits of his powers and tradition.  Ze rejects his spirit and dives into the uncertainty of teenage life, struggling to juggle overbearing parents, an impending graduation, a pregnant sister, and a relentless bully.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":101593,"logo_path":null,"name":"Guru Media","origin_country":"MN"},{"id":7059,"logo_path":"/xVFZ1RvZNvAMe7vGH8369fNW0bP.png","name":"Aurora Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":79291,"logo_path":"/xUbb6yEMwXCjdJDEYBQaMssUMrt.png","name":"Uma Pedra no Sapato","origin_country":"PT"},{"id":47606,"logo_path":null,"name":"Volya Films","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MN","name":"Mongolia"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Ze","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
