I made fifty or so paintings using the same template, a still life of a loaf of bread and a tiny guitar, and the only difference between the images is the color choice and the texture of the paint. The choice of images was a mild joke referring to the many 19th century still life paintings featuring bread. It was also, along with Spin Cycle, one of my bread films. I was having a two-man show at a gallery in Brooklyn with a painter who only painted butter. Our show was called “Bread and Butter Works.” - Jeff Scher","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3Eaoiy46LwdhP3Yk9olrSif7yfS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Still Loaf with Guitar","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
