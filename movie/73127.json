The film also depicts the ability of women and children to handle their everyday life after a dramatic war experience. Many of them live in tents or in ruins without walls or roofs. They are all in need of money, food, water and electricity. Others have lost family members, or are left with seriously injured children. Can war solve conflicts or create peace? The film follows three children through the war and the period after the ceasefire.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/l5kBINK4ubJDval359VuIl57xYW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129462,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nero AS","origin_country":""},{"id":106354,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tour de Force","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"},{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"}],"release_date":"2010-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tears of Gaza","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":10}
