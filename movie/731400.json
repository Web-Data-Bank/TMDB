Do you enjoy horror parodies? If you answered yes to either of these, this film is for you. If you answered yes to both. What are you waiting for?! From the team that was told repeatedly, \"I can't sell a black and white horror movie!\" Comes their next masterpiece, Silent But Deadly, A killer mime is on the loose, taking out a troupe of teen tropes in this outrageous horror comedy. If the meta jokes, and absurd references don't do it for you, the low brow fart jokes will.
