But money does not make him happy; his teddy bear Toto does. One morning Vanya notices a plush squirrel in a passing car. It seems to him that she is crying, apparently due to the fact that others do not notice that there is consciousness inside the squirrel. The squirrel could be a great couple for Totoshka and add a lot of joy to the life of Vanya and Totoshka. They find out that the squirrel was taken away from Minsk, and they set off in pursuit.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uvVHR0PWYondZFXc4uPaAx7QMzi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":138424,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinemaroom","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BY","name":"Belarus"}],"release_date":"2014-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vanya and Totoshka","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
