The ruins allow them to share the fragments of their days, survive the city and time, and become a small family. By making vestiges the foundation of their lives, their own ability to be reborn is revealed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hacEnqaIRnURvdZmCgZny17EAbj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"}],"release_date":"2015-08-25","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Squatters of the Devil's House","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
