I thought it a salt barn and approached it, but it was a very different one from my expectation. Perhaps, does not memory have such a quality? Men want to see what his shades of memory create. I thought myself a sort of trajectorization in order to describe a process of consciousness. The process of the work production is to make it conceivable as a thought process what the relation between I chasing memories and another I observing it means. It is described that on the axis of time the flow of film forms an ambivalent structure of consciousness and then it gets to have a trajectory, consequently revealing such an antinomic structure. That is, the gap between the filming action to confirm the realization of substance and its picture shot in the scene show that the memory cannot be identified with its object in the subject.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/w2bYThDYdl08eAZ0swPZUEBWDMF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Photographic Survey","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
