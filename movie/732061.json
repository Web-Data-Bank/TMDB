The house I used to live in is in the background. I follow the shapeless images and visit the places from the past. I imagine my father's house, although I haven't spoken to him for so long I don't even know where he lives now. Imagining his house is like surmising his life. There are times when passing-by images linger on. With my memory of \"now\", I'd like to bid farewell to a segment of my past. If a film is where you build up memories, I want to shine a light on the memories of countless failures.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ozzCRMT3x7CjBAiyAfFiyPLIiir.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2020-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dear.Picaresque","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
