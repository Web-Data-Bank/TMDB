When the pandemic hit we lost our personal support workers, and I found myself juggling caretaking, homeschooling and work.

Much of what she has been experiencing for years –profound disorientation, anxiety, mental fog–is what I was experiencing during isolation.  With snippets of night time conversations and a stack of my drawings, I’ve created a sense of our world together — a world of overlapping thought, lapses, bent time, lost words, the absurd, and love.” – Heather Frise","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Snippets of night-time conversations and drawings create a sense of the pandemic world Heather finds herself in – juggling work, homeschooling her daughter, and taking care of her mother who has Alzheimer’s.","title":"I Just Want to Wake Up","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
