Based on real events and set against a backdrop of the rise of right-wing politics in the U.S. and India, Diary of an Outsider ponders upon the question of the United States as a nation of immigrants. This is juxtaposed with the politics of hate and exclusion in India where the Tagorean ideal of universal brotherhood has long been trumped by narrow definitions of virulent nationalism.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Diary of an Outsider","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
