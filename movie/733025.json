Draeger's was their last show ever in their Chelsea space. At his advice, the dealer rented a storage unit at Storage Mart to store the unsold stock. Draeger asked if he could store a few items with the dealer: a huge tripod, a few Sotheby frames and a recent sculpture that he had hammered from a NYC parking sign. Four years later, Draeger received a call from the producers of Storage Wars, asking permission to feature his work in the show. Storage Mart auctions off any possessions from a unit that remains unpaid for three months. All Draeger's objects and many of his friends' artworks changed owner. The sculpture, which the new owner Joe P. calls a \"crazy installation\", has never been seen again.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A4eTLw4t2Lht4Qjgyp6WvzekQRy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Storage War Loot","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
