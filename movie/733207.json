Sophocles’ ancient play, written and performed in 429 BC during the time of a plague that killed one-third of the Athenian population, is a timeless story of arrogant leadership, ignored prophecy, and a pestilence that ravages the city of Thebes. At the time the play was first performed, the audience would have been reeling in the wake of a pestilence and its economic, political, and social aftermath. Seen through this lens Oedipus the King appears to have been a powerful public health tool for helping Athenians communalize the trauma of the plague, through a story that is as relevant now as it was in its own time.","popularity":0.694,"poster_path":"/xAvwzv2xkE2IKXrEOX3mmhSzoHo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":138612,"logo_path":null,"name":"Theatre of War Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Oedipus Project","video":true,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
