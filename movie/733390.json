Narrated by landscape architect Gena Wirth, the film analyzes processes of dredging and sand filling as a key infrastructural process in the production of urban space. The film combines observational footage of New York’s massive harbor deepening project with a series of self-reflexive research spirals that take place within the director's imagined computer desktop. As a result, the project not only explores the making of urban coastal landscapes, but also how these sedimentary landscapes are entangled with digitally mediated spaces of discourse and image.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qhYIFQxfHLKbgc7ZCDbg98QlImE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"As If Sand Were Stone...","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
