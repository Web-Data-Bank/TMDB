The musical and dramatic power of Götterdämmerung is awe-inspiring – sweeping us from Siegfried’s Rhine Journey to his Funeral March, and, finally, to Brünnhilde’s immolation and the work’s titanic orchestral climax.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ApZ63hZASDvNKJ3fJoI0rOtAS8v.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wagner: Götterdämmerung - Opera North","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
