From this moment we are plunged into the watery twilight beneath the river Rhine, transported to misty mountain-tops and to the depths of gloomy Nibelheim, before crossing the rainbow bridge that leads to Valhalla, fortress home of the gods. Set in a world populated by dwarfs and giants, gods and river-maidens, Wagner’s ‘preliminary evening’ to the Ring sets the whole epic cycle in motion in thrilling fashion.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ApZ63hZASDvNKJ3fJoI0rOtAS8v.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wagner: Das Rheingold - Opera North","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
