The segment, entitled Scientists Go to Antarctica to Study Weather, opens with HMAS Labuan leaving Melbourne, followed by scenes of the voyage. As they near shore, Big Ben volcano comes into view. Stores for the team's 12-month stay are then brought on shore. After a sequence showing local fauna, humorously described by the commentator, the segment ends with the outgoing team briefing their replacements.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6eLPgS2HTzge0PkDrSothoQViz9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"},{"iso_3166_1":"HM","name":"Heard and McDonald Islands"}],"release_date":"1949-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Scientists Go to Antarctica to Study Weather","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
