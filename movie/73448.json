He struggles between his own desire to gain critical respect and servicing the audience¿s needs. Costing his kindred friendship to on-stage partner Kjeld Petersen (Lars Ranthe) Dirch takes on Steinbeck's classic »Of Mice and Men«, only for the audience to break out in laughter at his first line. Dirch's Lennie becomes a running joke, and so has, Dirch believes, his own life.","popularity":2.774,"poster_path":"/ixP6xDR1hWkXeqp5bt8yvy8pSdZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5563,"logo_path":"/g2ozlYmAKKfly0sx8w8HktjBs9H.png","name":"Koncern TV og film","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2011-08-25","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A biography of the Danish actor and comedian, Dirch Passer","title":"A Funny Man","video":false,"vote_average":7.179,"vote_count":28}
