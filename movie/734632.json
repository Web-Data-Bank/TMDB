Beginning at the neurological level, Binary Thinking examines how changes in the brain have outcomes that play out in human behavior, and in turn, our society at large. It’s hard to say what the future has in store, but it is clear that many of the fears reflected in early science fiction literature and cinema have already taken hold of our previously analogue world. Binary Thinking’s abstract representation of our shifting world ultimately reveals that what really makes us human could be at stake.","popularity":0.605,"poster_path":"/9SKE52VBy321awipy3xleQ3OqON.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-02-29","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Binary Thinking","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
