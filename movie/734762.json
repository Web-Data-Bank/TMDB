From the days of Revolution Pro, to EPIC Pro Wrestling, to WPW, to the birth of Pro Wrestling Guerrilla.  In this interview a lot of names that you haven't heard for awhile get brought up such as: Bobby Quance, TARO, Top Gun Talwar and many more. The person who is the common thread through out a lot of these stories is Super Dragon. Joey Ryan and Excalibur talk about Super Dragon's overall importance to not just the early days of the SoCal independent pro wrestling scene, but his impact on the entire wrestling landscape today.  Also, this interview is back-loaded with a ton of fun facts and stories about PWG and what makes it one of the best wrestling promotions going today.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7ZTOR4905aFc0aPY7Dx9U9fBspJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hitting The Highspots - So-Cal Edition","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
