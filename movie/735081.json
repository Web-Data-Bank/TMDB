Without proper relief measures in place, the flood victims have no choice but to stay inside a cramped, filthy container together temporarily. A young girl named Gyeongju who is staying there with her mother notices Eunae who is by herself. In the midst of the poverty, redevelopment scheme and the cold selfishness of the grown-ups within the community, Gyeongju’s gaze upon Eunae is completely free from any prejudice. The film is a powerful portrayal of the barren landscape of the village soon to be demolished and a young girl who cannot find peace of mind.
