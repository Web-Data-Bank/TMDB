Unlike mainstream cinema, Rear view is presented as a lengthy single take: performed in a studio by the actors in real time – bringing a liveness to the performance that belies its cinematic medium – set against previously recorded, rear-projected footage of the view from the tail end of a vehicle travelling between the two towns.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2018-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rear View","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
