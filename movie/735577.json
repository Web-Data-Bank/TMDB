Wright","overview":"This short film follows Shaun J. Wright as he takes us through his roots in vogueing/ballroom culture and house music. “Sometimes I feel like I’m up against certain barriers, because when I look at who is given space to express themselves, it is people who don’t look like me. I feel like I come up against challenges that other people don’t, and that’s just the life of a black person. Queer on top of it.” —Shaun J.
