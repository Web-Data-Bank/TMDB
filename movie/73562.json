They fall in love at first sight, move in together and make a baby. A love story and the founding of a home like millions of others. Except that their little boy, Adam, behaves abnormally. The young parents try hard to persuade themselves that everything is okay but, with the passing of time, they cannot delude themselves anymore: their son has a problem. From now on, war is declared. A war against illness. A war against Death. A war against despair.","popularity":4.756,"poster_path":"/gVqIROaHxwwsxCSTEaEMqWyINmX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2700,"logo_path":"/h3bdysr6aNtFqK7DXQu1Rh43rwk.png","name":"Rectangle Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2011-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Declaration of War","video":false,"vote_average":7.129,"vote_count":174}
