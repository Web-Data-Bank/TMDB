It's all around in nature. Only birds and man can sing; man \"sings\" even when he speaks. We see a quick survey of the stages of life, as captured by songs: the alphabet song for primary school, Here Comes the Bride, The Old Gray Mare, etc. Some inspirations for song are outlined in song: love, sailing, trains, the West, motherhood, etc., but \"we never sing about brains.\" Finally, an example of how a simple melody can be expanded into a symphony: an elaborate version of the simple tune that opened the lesson","popularity":1.541,"poster_path":"/82t3v1Uu1KqloeTJFDA5GWeurOe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3166,"logo_path":"/vyyv4Gy9nPqAZKElPm2izLlEaVS.png","name":"Walt Disney Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1953-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The ScreenÂ´s First Animated Cartoon in 3-Dimension","title":"Melody","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":13}
