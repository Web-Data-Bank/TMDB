After cutting her hand at a party, she visits the hospital to seek what she assumes will be routine treatment. Instead, she falls victim to a predator in a white coat: Dr. Richard Darian, who drugs her and rapes her while she is asleep. Kimberly attempts to press charges, but the townsfolk and the local police, who regard her as a tramp and respect the doctor, dismiss her accusations.","popularity":3.903,"poster_path":"/mGZPrMGSnoRJd8arXaSHJgLUQpb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":53884,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rampage Entertainment Inc.","origin_country":""},{"id":53885,"logo_path":null,"name":"Accusatory Productions Inc.,","origin_country":""},{"id":11550,"logo_path":"/3oQFsgYn68gvDAkELfiX4tn65Ui.png","name":"Corus Entertainment","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2003-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"You Can Alter The Evidence, But Not The Truth.","title":"I Accuse","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":20}
