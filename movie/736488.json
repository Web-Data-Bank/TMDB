The artists featured in this documentary belong to a group known as ‘Iraqi Artists in Exile’. Filmed over three decades, this ambitious project explores their challenges, failures and successes, both as artists and in their private lives: from the time they graduated from art school in the 1970s, working as street artists in the piazzas of Rome and Florence, to becoming well-known. The central question the film poses is: what are the consequences of spending most of one’s life in exile? At a time of unprecedented global migration when barely a day passes without a tragic story played out in the international media, ‘Mirrors of Diaspora’ contributes to greater understanding of one of the defining issues of our time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5SL7tSb99hHOGYAmwCLmZwOTNlg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IQ","name":"Iraq"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mirrors of Diaspora","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
