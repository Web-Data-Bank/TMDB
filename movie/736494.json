His satyrical poems and songs from the 1950s and 60s today sound more urgent and topical than ever, and are covered by musicians ranging from Finnish avant-garde accordion player Kimmo Pohjonen, to legendary Croatian songstress Josipa Lisac, to the former Bad Seed Hugo Race. The music is produced by indie rock icon Cris Eckman (The Walkabouts), and expertly mixed with archive footage of Jezek's own performances and skits, creating a touching and thought-provoking narrative.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rMhagebWiKAR7i7xIVYi38IAl5L.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109096,"logo_path":null,"name":"Petra Pan Film Production","origin_country":"SI"},{"id":83800,"logo_path":"/qAIl2gCsGw3jnMbE6lGaHex7jie.png","name":"Restart","origin_country":"HR"},{"id":109122,"logo_path":null,"name":"PPFP doel","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"},{"iso_3166_1":"MK","name":"Macedonia"},{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"2016-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"},{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Life story of Ježek - Slovenian Charlie Chaplin, who is an inspiration for 14 international musicians to create new versions of his songs.","title":"My World Is Upside Down","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
