There, immersed in a disturbing world of strange mystical codes, he learns that his father was tracking a huge buck with awe-inspiring antlers alongside the “Indian”. After several outstanding short films, Aurtenèche delivers a first feature that obliquely references the legend of Saint Hubert, who encountered the Almighty while hunting a stag. A cryptic thriller, hidden manuscripts, the quest for self-knowledge, psychotropic drugs: La Contemplation du mystère boldly shifts between moods and genres.","popularity":1.401,"poster_path":"/A3zpPKZTCCe4i04HLoCAAhEvA3j.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13839,"logo_path":"/125UdB9wgDkY2RNpjgCiKyk3Dll.png","name":"Metafilms","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2021-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Contemplation du mystère","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
