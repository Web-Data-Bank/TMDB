Marek) places an advertisement for the founding of the Cimrman theater ensemble. The two young men who join him - Jiří Nezájem (J. Nebeský) and Jiří Zájem (J. Nezhyba) - will then experience with him during the effort to start rehearsing the performance of an incredible blow of fate, culminating in a shift in time by thirty years.
