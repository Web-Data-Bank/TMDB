In the mid-19th century old-fashioned estate based on serfdom laws and traditions, tough and shrewd Arina Petrovna tries her best to make her realm prosper and even expand – despite unwillingness of her husband and three of her four children to lend helping hands... Ten years on, serfdom abolished, and now Porfiry-Yudishka, the epitome of a corrupt, cruel hypocrite, becomes the heir to the estate. Dullness and horrors of life, spent in destroying everybody around him, finally makes him to slowly realize things went somehow wrong. Half-mad, apparently, he goes to the cemetery to \"ask for forgiveness\" from his mother Arina Petrovna, and dies somewhere along his way, his frozen corpse found the next day.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sPu7A55GgO3iy2bCauaeq7OczFY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":106527,"logo_path":null,"name":"Soyuzfilm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1934-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yudishka Golovlyov","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
