He also highlights some recently released information about German pharmaceutical giant Grünenthal, who aggressively marketed the drug, and are now selling it again under a different usage, but still with no compensation for those who's lives they affected so deeply. The indefatigable spirit of the extraordinary thalidomide victims is cast against the callousness disregard of the drug's manufacturers in a film that lays out the story from it's beginnings in the late 50s to the current state of affairs in the present day.  —Philip Webley","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lHOAQeDpFlcFceKJixudNLnXSAm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":151326,"logo_path":null,"name":"Real to Reel Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2016-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Oscar-winning documentary filmmaker John Zaritsky returns to the story that has fascinated and compelled him for years - thalidomide and it's effect on the survivors of \"the worst drug disaster in history.\"","title":"No Limits: The Thalidomide Saga","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
