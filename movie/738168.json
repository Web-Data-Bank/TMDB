With no signal and an unreliable GPS, they try to navigate their way out using road signs. Along a narrow road, through a deep forest, their front tire suddenly blows out. With no spare or cell service, they are completely cut off. Soon they discover that this is no ordinary forest and there is a reason no cars come up here, for the locals know of what lives deep in the woods and if theyâ€™re woken, there is nowhere to run.","popularity":3.023,"poster_path":"/oA9BhUFjCwhME0Q9xgUSIGV1pf5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77659,"logo_path":"/x7IqPceeNwr6VT4aq3tqlATMSCt.png","name":"Picture Perfect","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Dark Path","video":false,"vote_average":2.6,"vote_count":5}
