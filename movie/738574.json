His heart is warmed when he falls in love with his fragile neighbour, but then her illness takes a turn for the worse.  In Opéra de Monte Carlo's production of Puccini’s beloved opera, set in Paris to the interwar period, the artists’ misery looks more like a chosen lifestyle than a suffered fate. Jean-Louis Grinda’s sumptuous staging reflects on Puccini’s romantic glorification of the precariousness of the human condition.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9Ry6Dvwmvnves9maFSbr6zL2TM6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-08-28","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La bohème – Opéra de Monte Carlo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
