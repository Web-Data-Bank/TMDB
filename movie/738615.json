Their names are Forever Man and Forever Woman. They are embodied by actors and actresses from long-gone eras, but also by cartoon characters and puppet animations. Together they narrate the story of the euphoric ups and tragic downs of human existence. When Forever Dies, a virtuoso collage of film fragments from the Eye Filmmuseum archive, is an epic ode to largely unseen cinema anchored in the polarizing world of today.","popularity":0.941,"poster_path":"/tefbvtwxWiVoUbeXfJukcrrkQXM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72500,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tangerine Tree","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":95556,"logo_path":"/gMsu30npr1bSVn7jAjJ2A2jO6S8.png","name":"EYE Film Institute Netherlands","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2020-08-31","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A cinematic fantasia 125 years in the making","title":"When Forever Dies","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
