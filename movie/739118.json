But Duane had a secret. At age eight, he started wearing his mother’s clothing and grandmother’s clip on earrings. He questioned his gender identity and his very identity through college, divorce, and his now his 4o-year marriage to Pam. Dawn attempted to suppress her true identity for five decades.
