Born from a year-long process of research and reflection on \"alternative fantasy\" in film, this project would not have been possible without the immense support of my extremely dedicated cast and crew, the guidance of my teachers and family, and the generosity of our Kickstarter backers. Thank you so much to everyone who brought life to \"Border Woods\".","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Border Woods","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
