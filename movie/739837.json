Each film is made in one single shot; in which a total shot slowly changes into a close-up. The leading characters in ‘Rain’, ‘Sugar’ and ‘Eye’ are focusing on a detail. Literally seeing another world in this detail causes a fundamental change of their ideas about this reality.  In ‘Eye' a man and a woman look each other so profoundly in the eyes that they experience the impossibility of a symbiosis.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/enWa3x7s44K38wFOruQFHj1CxuK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22628,"logo_path":null,"name":"Netherland Filmfund","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eye","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
