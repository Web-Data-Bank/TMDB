That has been the mantra by which those at Stamford Bridge have lived and died since Roman Abramovich bought Chelsea in 2003. And as the final whistle blew on the final game of the season at the Estádio do Dragão in Portugal, history was made as Chelsea were once again crowned the kings of European football. The intentions of the club were clear from the start of the season, bringing in a host of top-class talent including Timo Werner and Kai Havertz from the Bundesliga, Hakim Ziyech from the Eredivisie, as well as defensive reinforcements in Thiago Silva and Ben Chilwell. However all was not going to plan mid-season with inconsistent results and a managerial change suggesting this was going to be no more than a season of transition. But a spectacular turnaround, masterminded by the managerial nous of Thomas Tuchel, led to a top-four Premier League finish, an FA Cup final, and the greatest club prize of them all - the Champions League trophy.","popularity":0.617,"poster_path":"/2SQ10ToBk34ai6t1y7F1AZvD2Qx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":93472,"logo_path":null,"name":"PDI Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":128,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chelsea FC - Season Review 2020/21","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
