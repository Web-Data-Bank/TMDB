This is the story of a tour the band makes to visit Aboriginal communites in central Australia, stopping at Alice Springs, Hermannsburg, Papunya and Yuendumu. It's a fascinating insight into their thoughts and feelings as they bring their version of \"white man's culture\" to outback communities where traditional Indigenous culture and language is strong.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Country Outcasts","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
