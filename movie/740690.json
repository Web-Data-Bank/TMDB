Questioning their racial exclusivity, she takes an unprecedented insider's look at the pageantry and asks: what does it mean to be the queen of the masked men? As she examines her own place in an alluring tradition, Snedeker challenges viewers to reflect on the roles we all play in our lives. Ideal for courses in gender studies, sociology, anthropology, american studies, multicultural studies, southern history and psychology.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mCe3F460wVME8NCf5trKkJKLuqP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"By Invitation Only","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
