Composed entirely out of archival footage, much of it from the Soviet science and space archives, delicately scored and building to an undeniable mood of surreal (perhaps even ominous) energy, it charts (and re-purposed) the progress of man into to the unknown area of space exploration with a flair for creating art out film that was shot by scientists and engineers as a mundane record.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ascension","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
