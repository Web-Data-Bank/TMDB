Following the great French tradition, this opéra-comique has it all: 18th-century Rococo Parisian glamour and a perilous love story involving the dashing and flirtatious Chapelou and his opposite, the powerful and clever Madeleine. This lavish and spectacular production from the Opéra Comique in Paris received widespread critical acclaim and also features costumes by the iconic French fashion designer Christian Lacroix.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/arKfFYyI3kaZSE8EsXYeouFGclB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":137,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Postillon de Lonjumeau","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
