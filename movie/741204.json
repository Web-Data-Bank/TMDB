In 1968, he discovered his own soul, learned meditation, which changed his life, and hung out with John, Paul, George and Ringo. Fifty years later, he finds \"Bungalow Bill\" in Hawaii; connects with David Lynch about his own inner journey; as well as preeminent Beatles historian, Mark Lewisohn; Academy Award nominated film composer, Laurence Rosenthal; and Pattie and Jenny Boyd. And much of this is due to Saltzman's own daughter, Devyani, reminding him that he had put away and forgotten these remarkably intimate photographs of that time in 1968.","popularity":0.788,"poster_path":"/kTL6UXYclNoUXDomnDdJtqIygtq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107063,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sunrise Films","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2020-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Jai Guru Deva!","title":"Meeting the Beatles in India","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
