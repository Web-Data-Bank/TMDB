Frustrated with the unconvincing performances of his lead actor, he pulls another young sexy Cree man into the role. Jealousy ensues as Curtis alternately gushes over the two Cree boys as he manipulates them into broad Hollywood caricatures. A “Lonesome Rider” intercedes, teasing the action to a tragic twist, which forces the boys to take control of Curtis’ film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/v3MQRwrQjyLjzCgYBcv4te7COLP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":165045,"logo_path":null,"name":"Urban Nation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shooting Geronimo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
