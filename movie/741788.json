Confused by advice on what to avoid when buying a horse, our gullible settler is fooled into buying a \"mare's egg\"--to hatch his own colt! After weeks without success, he tosses the \"egg\" into the bushes--with hare-raising results! But as he chases after the \"hatched colt,\" he remembers the advice: big ears--stubborn; big teeth--a biter; low in the hindquarters--a runaway for sure. Well, maybe he's better off without this one, and off he goes on his optimistic way--with plans to save up and buy another egg! Adapted from a story by Carole Spray.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sJboPGJpnlVGBi0A71yCSK3I66s.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mare's Egg","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
