Audrey works away at her computer and she encounters a problem. Nothing seems to help: neither a co-worker's advice, nor the user manual, nor the help line. Stuck on hold, Audrey dreams of how simple life must have been before the age of technology.  This animated tale, with a real animal soundtrack, makes for a funny and witty dig at how little we've really evolved. A film without words.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/OR7sDImROs17aeWQTAstTDsWBM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Cow's Tale","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
