The film is an homage to Tait, whom Aurand visited in Orkney.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yS39v2Z9gYtCL6gvluFOoCwMS0b.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2020-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Glimpses from a Visit to Orkney in Summer 1995","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
