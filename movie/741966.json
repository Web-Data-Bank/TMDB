The crossing is commonly made in fishing boats and other small craft; hundreds of harragas die each year. Zine embarks for Spain with a group of others, while Rayyane decides to stay back to raise more money for the crossing - which involves tricking his uncle into lending him money under the pretense of running a local business. But, like so many other working poor around the world, Rayanne refuses to weigh the danger against the prospect of a better world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4VnqX17psUrj7QAl50xFvNxpbnI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Harraga Blues","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
