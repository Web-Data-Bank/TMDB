Four people of Muslim ascendency searching for the truth about their own lives evoke the last decades of French colonization, the years of war, from 1955 to 1962. Hatred and friendship lead us through a hidden memory: their relationships with their Jewish and Christian neighbours. The foundational myths of the new Algeria are revisited, but will they succeed in getting to the bottom of their own legends?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5qD83EiZsc00pWW9bOqqCh7zyJg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":167314,"logo_path":null,"name":"Naouel Films","origin_country":""},{"id":168653,"logo_path":null,"name":"1001 Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DZ","name":"Algeria"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2008-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":160,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Algeria, Unspoken Stories","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
