The Sex Victims (1973) is very much part of the Britsploitation fold, featuring gratuitous nudity, working-class vernacular and rough sex. Yet director Derek Robbins also veers into some of the same uncanny territory directors like José Larraz would later explore at feature length, making it a unique hybrid. In fact, The Sex Victims would make a perfect bill cousin for Larraz’s Vampyres (1974) for the way in which it combines ample nudity with supernatural elements.
