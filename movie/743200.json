He's chased by an army of knights, but both he and his pursuers ride music-hall half-horse costumes in lieu of real steads. He proceeds to fight, Fairbanks-like, dozens of swordsmen at once, and defeats his rival one-on-one, leaving him to marry the princess in a state ceremony.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8vRZKLdix2SKFXppiOYSe9ra2GH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":45239,"logo_path":null,"name":"Quality Film Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1923-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When Knights Were Cold","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
