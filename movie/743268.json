As you watch this video, carefully consider the unimaginable complexity and potential of the human brain, the architectural masterwork of the hand and skeletal system, and the incredible durability of the heart. In the human body, God's creative power expresses its magnificent dimension. But there is far more to the miracle of the human experience than the wonders of the body and mind. God has made each of us for the highest purpose of all, to know and enjoy His love and care forever.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vjnsGLvymjG7dAIbjwzgFCdbhl6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Human Life: Crown of Creation","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
