As they grow up as their true selves, we watch the people around them adapt. Their parents are open about the fact that they have struggled with their childrenâ€™s transition. Neither sensationalist, nor ordinary, Tras is an honest work that focuses on one of the smallest and most marginalised minorities in Irish society and allows them to flourish and be themselves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tras","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
