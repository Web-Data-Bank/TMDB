The hard worked scenario is criticised and undermined by the unpretentious censorship of the authorities. The film producers constantly pressure for lack of money, and even casting actors to the unfamous director is not an easy task. With the help of friends and relatives, the hardly prepared film production begins at last. However, an accident occurs in which an expensive camera is dropped. To fix the broken camera and to escape the difficult life, he even thinks of robbing the bank and he starts to plan.","popularity":1.174,"poster_path":"/m02FJqV6qt1UgcEFcsWIuBbAy2P.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":169010,"logo_path":null,"name":"Electronic Pictures Film Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MM","name":"Myanmar"}],"release_date":"2023-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Burmese","iso_639_1":"my","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Money Has Four Legs","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
