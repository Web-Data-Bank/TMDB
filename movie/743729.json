But today, very few Americans are benefiting from the collective wealth of our great nation. Rising wealth inequality continues to reward the rich and powerful – leaving the rest of us behind to fight over crumbs. It’s time to reimagine a new social contract. INHERENT GOOD is a 60-minute documentary starring southern comedian Trae Crowder who takes viewers on a journey to explore a transformative idea of giving free cash to every citizen – no strings attached. This big idea called Universal Basic Income is examined through personal stories of perseverance by everyday Americans living in the heartland. It’s not a matter if we deserve it, but rather do we trust each other to make basic income a reality for everyone?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/AapDILUuG6GcEGZ82TBXlZjeAhr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inherent Good","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
