The film is a mixture of flickery, Letraset, light, scratching and hand-drawn colours. So rapid is the movement that it makes you wonder at times if you are looking at an image or its afterimage. Could a film like Frames be damaging to your retina or neurological functions? If you sat in front of this type of film long enough, would it send you on a trip? Could it awaken a patient out of a coma? After a confronting seven minutes I felt exhausted and slightly frazzled, such is the power of the film. A Dirk de Bruyn retrospective would certainly kill me. -Glen Hannah","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lrtps2ObcJZJQwJsulhPqZpc2cg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frames","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
