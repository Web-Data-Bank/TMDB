Each of the three films was evenly divided into two half-hour \"episodes,\" and each starred Hugh Beaumont as San Francisco-based amateur sleuth Dennis O'Brien. In Pier 23, O'Brien first tackles the case of a wrestler who has died of a suspicious heart attack after refusing to lose a match. He then agrees to help a priest talk an escaped criminal into returning to prison. The film's two-part structure leads to repetition and predictability, but it's fun to watch TV's \"Ward Cleaver\" making like Philip Marlowe.","popularity":1.088,"poster_path":"/bNkMVxoTlyOwtyH9R1DhMaDhNzc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5164,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sigmund Neufeld Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1950-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"GANGLAND GALAHAD!
