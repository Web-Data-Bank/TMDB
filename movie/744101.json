Upon discovery of the Americas, they knew next to nothing about this new world and mistakenly named it « Western Indies ». Henceforth local inhabitants would be named Indians. The video’s soundtrack features a Native American tune (by the Kali’na people of French Guiana and Suriname) as sung in Tamil (a language from Southern India). The tale undergoes a slow transformation: now it’s not so much a journey from East to West as it is an inner quest.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/euQHJeVjCSnGysfTMzinf2k6b1g.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2019-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Voyages dans nos Indes intérieures","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
