A crossroad where beloved people meet, lonely next door people, strange travellers. Their stories are intertwined, the past meets the present, music and dancing transform reality. As the night falls and the celebration reaches its ecstatic peak, the café becomes a small Arc, travelling beyond space and time, filled with memories, wishes, and revelations. 50 actors, musicians and dancers take part in the film.","popularity":0.609,"poster_path":"/a3ftxOhiTfGfIzqL57jDmRv0j49.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7255,"logo_path":"/aHu0SirjV9Mi0OrlnFWqZwy50wW.png","name":"EPT","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2020-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You Sing, I Sing","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
