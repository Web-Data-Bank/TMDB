Long, aching lines of motionless vehicles sit at one of Israelâ€™s hated checkpoints. Two men habitually pray on the road alongside their stopped car. A lone helicopter hovers overhead, reinforcing the reality of perpetual occupation.  Roads Through Palestine is a cinematic portrait of life in the West Bank, and an intimate reflection on the geography of war. Directed by Brett Story with music by Stefan Christoff.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qLTVl3vteE3bf9QTs8vxdHmmbi9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Roads Through Palestine","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
