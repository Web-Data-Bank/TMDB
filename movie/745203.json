The good news is we expect nothing different this time around.  Our original sit down with Kevin and Davey (known then as VERSUS) actually gave birth to the Kevin Steen show. Just when you thought everything was all warm and fuzzy with the American Wolf, he somehow has managed to ruffle old feathers once again. From the NXT try outs, outspoken opinions about ROH that made even Kevin Steen uneasy, to his very recent TNA Wrestling debut, Davey has a lot of explaining to do!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sykRja8m8brNIqgPRhZcQwmPWIO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145881,"logo_path":"/e0PDWobzrIHM8OTrzlJCYqfQsks.png","name":"HighSpots","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-04","revenue":0,"runtime":134,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Kevin Steen Show: Davey Richards","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
