Kevin sits down with ROH Superstar & Monster Energy drink fanatic, Eddie Edwards.  This episode of The Kevin Steen Show was filmed right before Eddie got on a plane for a tour of Mexico. We felt like it would be a good idea to get him on camera before we left just in case he got kidnapped by the drug cartel in Mexico.  Luckily Eddie made it back home safely. So, in this non-memorial edition of The Kevin Steen Show Eddie talks about his life as a fat kid, his sweet dreads, being a young boy for Pro Wrestling NOAH and how hard it really is to catch a flight after drinking all night. Also, did we mention that we talked about Eddie's sweet dreads? Well, sit back pop open a Monster Energy Drink or beer and enjoy The Kevin Steen Show with Eddie Edwards.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/a5Zjdnvcwfwrb9Q6KR5YPZTNoie.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145881,"logo_path":"/e0PDWobzrIHM8OTrzlJCYqfQsks.png","name":"HighSpots","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":137,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Kevin Steen Show: Eddie Edwards","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
