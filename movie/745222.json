Ooooh yeeeaahh!!  Wikipedia man was on point for this episode and he need to be because we had HUGE TV star Jay Lethal on The Kevin Steen Show. Kevin and special co-host, Zane Riley had a well informed conversation with Jay about his early years of his career in JAPW and Ring of Honor. Although, Wikipedia man forgot to mention Papa Lethal's unmeasurable hatred for Larry Zbyszko.  The fun begins when Jay starts talking about his time in TNA and how his backstage impersonations became the thing that pushed his career forward. And in a Kevin Steen Show exclusive you get to hear Jay's impersonation of Kevin Nash. Who knows you may see The Lethal Diesel on your wrestling TV program sometime soon.  So sit back and enjoy Kevin Steen Show fans and Wikipedia man because you got a lot to learn about Jay Lethal.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/trTbAFU0Jey7pSBWGMczl1JezQR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145881,"logo_path":"/e0PDWobzrIHM8OTrzlJCYqfQsks.png","name":"HighSpots","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-12-29","revenue":0,"runtime":142,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Kevin Steen Show: Jay Lethal","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
