The event was organized by Inoki to promote world peace with an interpromotional event involving major promotions from around the world. Forty wrestlers from six countries ended up taking part in the event.  Inoki's home promotion New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), as well as smaller independent groups, represented Japan, while World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) took part on behalf of the United States. Both of Mexico's top promotions Asistencia Asesoría y Administración (AAA) and Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre (CMLL) participated in the event, which was considered unlikely by many in the industry given their own heated rivalry.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/m5ZfCaxee4G7BturTzJs0Cb0MRL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"World Wrestling Peace Festival","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
