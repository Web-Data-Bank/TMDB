So there are clips of him interviewing them, shooting photos and even having physical encounters. And there are several conversations that dig deeper into attitudes. The key point is that most of these guys are straight, and Ohm is flirting shamelessly with them. The film is loosely edited, jumping around between encounters as it explores ideas about attraction, lust and even porn. It's silly and relaxed, and of course very indulgent too.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fLCGQ1RBIiPVmKzITci2CVU7BrH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Meaning of It All","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
