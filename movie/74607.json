Maybe but the fact is that his head has invariably caused laughter whatever the circumstances, which is the tragedy of his life. After having worked as an undertaker, a theater prompter, a casino bouncer, and so on, and failing at each job, he applies out of desperation to an institution where those rejected for physical reasons can hide and live together. But Adhémar immediately starts... laughing at them and gets kicked out as a result! In the end though, he finds his way as a circus artist.","popularity":0.692,"poster_path":"/1auekdiLeceCYzrjF4LivrYlzDK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18844,"logo_path":null,"name":"Indusfilms","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1951-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Adhémar or the Toy of Destiny","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":7}
