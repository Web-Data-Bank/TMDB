Fighting individually, the space monster's metal-eating and acid-spitting abilities prove too much for Japan's super robot forces - only their combined might stands a chance against defeating it! But with Mazinger Z damaged, can Getter Robo defend against the monster long enough for its comrade to be repaired? And even with forces combined, can they defeat the monster before all of Japan is destroyed?","popularity":3.128,"poster_path":"/89YVgEo3wo3PGpVKgiPwzThmqAD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5542,"logo_path":"/ayE4LIqoAWotavo7xdvYngwqGML.png","name":"Toei Animation","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":12268,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dynamic Planning","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1975-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Great Mazinger vs. Getter Robo","video":false,"vote_average":5.944,"vote_count":8}
