The Patient in Room 18. Patric Knowles delivers a delightfully comic performance as Lance, an outwardly normal young man obsessed with detective stories. When his obsession threatens to lapse over into lunacy, Lance is sent to the hospital for a nice long rest. It isn't long before he gets mixed up in a genuine murder mystery, using his second-hand knowhow to solve the case. Up-and-coming Ann Sheridan is quite amusing as Lance's nurse and confidante, while the murderer is played by a fellow who is usually cast as the murder victim.","popularity":0.847,"poster_path":"/chltZYE15605sZ8DMCrP2OTXNqj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":174,"logo_path":"/IuAlhI9eVC9Z8UQWOIDdWRKSEJ.png","name":"Warner Bros.
