Nina puts on her best ‘self ’—expensive clothes, lots of makeup, etc.—and leaves her kitsch luxury home. Anna unchains her old bicycle and leaves her semi-derelict building. Nina almost crashes into Anna as she carelessly exits her garage with her girly car. She yells a couple of insults at Anna, and then both resume their journeys to their respective destinations. Their destinations will tell us a lot about the different directions in which their lives are moving.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8wbhiaM6QqDhls0u0oHzfiu0Du5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76558,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vertigo Visual","origin_country":"MK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MK","name":"Macedonia"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Macedonian","iso_639_1":"mk","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cut Here","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
