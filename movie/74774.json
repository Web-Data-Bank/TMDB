The \"almost\" is because of Dan Dance (Eddie Byrne), an old rogue who would rather drink and philosophize than work. The Village Council are determined to have a perfect record so they connive to have the old man put into the alms-house which has been unoccupied for many years, where he must abide by rules laid down 400 years ago. A new Vicar arrives and discovers that, because of the circumstances created by the Council, Dan Dance is entitled to 6,000 pounds a year at the expense of the village.","popularity":1.037,"poster_path":"/brZNG28yGfnxfIi2akbdsy6RLZf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1952-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Time, Gentlemen, Please!","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":4}
