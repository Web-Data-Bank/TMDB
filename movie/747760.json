Departing from the boundless universe of data, we set our foot on one narrow street of Seoul. It felt even smaller than a dot. Departing from the boundless universe of data, we set our foot on one narrow street of Seoul. It felt even smaller than a dot. While materializing this street into VR, we hoped to express that even in this minute part of a microscopic city, movement continued unabated. The entity you come across may be a joyful rhythm beating inside your heart, a lonely rhythm standing unaccompanied or a hectic and restless rhythm that always has to be somewhere, anywhere but here. Lost embodies such rhythms. We may seem to be lonely beings that stand in the middle of the city, lost, without any inclination of where to go or how to get to another place.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lW070JmIqjlLp24FRLZA8CAm6rX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2019-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lost","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
