Action is staged in the digital realm as a computerized consciousness passes through the pre-libidinal stages of development, articulating and mimicking signs like a child learning to speak. The fundamental trauma of the distinction between souls is embodied in the severance of the mother/child bond, enacted with humanity as the parents of digital simulacra. What does it mean to be born without a body?  A discarded draft of a larger project in development. All algorithms coded by hand.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/l4mvhnlVHfncxx9sByrK40Ma5Rf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"beta sessions (holophrasis.exe)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
