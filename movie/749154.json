The first act, filmed as an observational documentary in the world’s largest flower market, follows millions of bouquets transiting through a cavernous refrigerated hangar to be sold at auction, an industrial process at once both beautiful and terrifying. The film transitions to fiction in a second act freely adapted from a Pirandello play. A man with a flower-shaped tumour on his lip accosts a traveller in an all-night café. Their seemingly mundane conversation becomes a metaphysical monologue as the man, feeling death approach, clings to life by scrupulously observing its activity, watching reality in every detail, as if to fill the gap between himself and the rest of the world.","popularity":0.673,"poster_path":"/jWye42Xf92c9rDi70h9jZlpXHJA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":141194,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kunst Halle Sankt Gallen","origin_country":""},{"id":34217,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jeonju International Film Festival","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":7395,"logo_path":"/cGOGYYfbJZ1uJHynRIf8yj4phRn.png","name":"Les films du Worso","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":90409,"logo_path":null,"name":"Poulet-Malassis","origin_country":""},{"id":94594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Flaneur Films","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Flower in the Mouth","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
