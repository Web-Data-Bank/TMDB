Performers featured include Gerald Finley, Peter Savidge and Josephine Barstow. The conductor is Kent Nagano.  As pertinent now as then, OWEN WINGRAVE was composed by Benjamin Britten at the height of the Vietnam War. The opera poses the question: Is pacifism an act of cowardice? Or rather a desire to escape from the spiral of war and create world peace? To what extent do we determine our own futures? Should we let past events inform the decisions we make? Brittenâ€™s characters grapple with timeless issues in this gripping psychodrama.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ovNhJ29ZII8fMC0plfzm1wPFrDT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5778,"logo_path":"/2loyoQweDxvotH3AknfL2zhsthg.png","name":"Channel 4 Television","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":2327,"logo_path":null,"name":"MJW Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Owen Wingrave","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
