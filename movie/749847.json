In 1775, the Habsburg Queen, Maria Theresa, sent a hundred foresters and their families here from the Austrian west of the kingdom. All that remains today of the now over two century-old timber industry are factory ruins, potholes in the valley road and an increasingly seldom heard German dialect. Only a few factories survived a flood that cut the village off from the rest of the world, and left it economically isolated. An atmosphere of farewell hangs heavy in the air.","popularity":0.889,"poster_path":"/2p2BkJp9pZivTrUXpw8S5W0BBpc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":141304,"logo_path":null,"name":"LUKASPIT Filmproduktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2020-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Austrians","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
