In 1970, eighty indigenous marched, in uniform, in the courtyard of a police station, to the leadership of the military dictatorship. Fifty years later, the film seeks out these guards - their bodies, their stories, their memories. Fractures, silences, what remains and what is lost in violent Brazilian history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uD5YUuBOuD6i21zwZF8Q7Qxdlm0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2020-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"PortuguÃªs"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Flecha e a Farda","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
