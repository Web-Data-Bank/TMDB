Reggie's best friend is dead, and the pain of his loss leads the hardened player on a quest to ensure that the killer pays for his crime. Upon tracking the killer to a gym, Reggie enters, gun in hand and ready to avenge his friend's death. As the other players declare that no one will die on their court without a fair trial, they listen to both sides of the story to determine if justice will be served with a bullet, or whether the suspected killer will live to play another game.","popularity":0.655,"poster_path":"/21Zwak95m3v8n1WvEuFdoho9wiA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":35,"logo_path":"/wxrHa3nZ1K4zo65p56991INkGo6.png","name":"Lions Gate Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":10000,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Playaz Court","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
