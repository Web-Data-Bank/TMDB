It requires the memorisation of 320 routes, an achievement that takes years, but has been made into a joke by the robot cars of the future. A flesh-and-blood cabby “interacts with people from all walks of life,” according to a brochure by Transport for London, and that’s “a lot more than just taking people from A to B.” Visually fascinating, Colson traces his interviewees’ mind maps of the city using the mapping technology of robot cars.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5FLGb2oSVUL4GEuZseepraUMett.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"London Knowledge","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
