Through a series of quickly edited montage sequences, Confrontation offers prescient commentary regarding the country's stark racial divisions, governmental corruption under Nixon, and rampant consumerism, amongst other issues. Bailen combines footage of the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom and protests against the Vietnam War in Chicago, IL, juxtaposing them with newspaper headlines and still image photography from different magazines or advertisements that provide sardonic commentary on the issues explored throughout the film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Confrontation","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
