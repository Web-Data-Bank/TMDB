It discusses the reason as to why gay men moved from 'traditional' rugby leagues in favour of gay rugby tournaments. Through interviews with rugby players, the film tries to break the stereotypes society has of the gay world, about the absence of openly homosexual players in sports teams and the idea that gay men do not take on sporting roles because they are not manly enough.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3s4LpiMW0sAUC0GuauNVXx0yzDl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bulls","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
