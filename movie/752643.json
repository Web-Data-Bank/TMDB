It’s his escape, his identity, and his legacy. But over the course of his 45 years in the mountains, he’s seen many things change: more extreme weather, fewer snow days, and economic strain on mountain towns.  Motivated by an urge to protect the places he loves, Jeremy sets out on a physical and philosophical journey to find common ground with fellow outdoor people across diverse political backgrounds. He learns their hopes and fears while walking a mile in their shoes on the mountain and in the snow.  With intimacy and emotion set against breathtaking backdrops, Purple Mountains navigates America’s divide with a refreshing perspective: even though we may disagree about climate policy, our shared values can unite us","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/l4PePFPgzKpw68wHDE3GsydXlR5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11117,"logo_path":"/vkZJsXBKKfHZVLMDxuMktZXNmyA.png","name":"Teton Gravity Research","origin_country":"US"},{"id":143055,"logo_path":null,"name":"Liars and Thieves","origin_country":""},{"id":143056,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sound Off Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"One man's journey to find common ground in the mountains — one voter at a time.","title":"Purple Mountains","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
