The first shot alludes to the end of Erichvon Stroheim's Foolish Wives, where the corpse of the hero-director is dispatched in a man-hole. Other dramatic self-portraits follow: Caravaggio's Goliath, Dante's Sestina (read by the film-maker), and DÃ¼rer's Self-portrait with Eryngium. The abandoned villa of Migrazione is revisited. But the finale is hopeful.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1970-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Coda","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
