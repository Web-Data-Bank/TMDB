Or, rather, the story of the reunion between a father and son who have hardly seen each other over many years and who clumsily attempt to renew bonds. Unfortunately, too much time has already passed and it will be impossible to strengthen the ties. But although they lose each other again, the father will nevertheless pass on a legacy to his son: the love of music.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1gyI2oFKDb2ouYdaYKz2VZIfL2a.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":68259,"logo_path":null,"name":"Origine Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2019-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La musique","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
