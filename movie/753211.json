Making things happen, having the audacity to obtain what one wants or who one desires: c'est la vie!  Letting oneself be carried by the general motion and voluntarily submitting oneself to the desires of others: c'est la vie!  Creating a future by breaking a past choice: c'est la vie!  Stopping everything and taking time to take and give intense pleasure to two or three people wherever one happens to be: c'est la vie!  In a city, the young man, a married workman, a librarian, a nurse, a clerk - each in turn come up against the reality of existence!  Let yourself be penetrated! It's our life!  This film takes you even further than \"Double en Jeu\".","popularity":0.871,"poster_path":"/kHy6qu1i5NJQ8qOJxILtrKlwbgE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":65669,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cadinot","origin_country":""},{"id":65668,"logo_path":"/qHpNaCy2IGoTdyQkI2eD972E7Va.png","name":"French Art","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"C'est la vie","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
