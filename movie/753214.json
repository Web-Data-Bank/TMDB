He gets a little money on the side at the end of the month by exchanging his charms to one of his sex-mad bosses, the son of the local notary, even the notary himself, against a menu of presents that recompense the mediocrity of his day-to-day existence and brighten up the miserable chalet where he lives, deep in the woods. His prowess for sex in all directions irritates the local Judeo-Christians and their moralizing lot. The offerings build up, his life gets better and a meeting with a fashion photographer suddenly allows him to afford a future with more promising horizons. Subversion is a social commentary without concession where these actors uncover their charms and realize their maddest fantasies in eleven particularly subversive scenes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2NKYeTuwx6gvf1evJWfg7cTqrTc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":65668,"logo_path":"/qHpNaCy2IGoTdyQkI2eD972E7Va.png","name":"French Art","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2009-08-06","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Subversion","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
