He draws them, but above all, he creates them by draping them, by building them on the body of a cabin mannequin. Gaultier recreates in front of the camera twelve of his most emblematic creations. The dresses appear before our eyes and we follow the thought of Jean-Paul Gaultier walking between ideas and matter. The work of Gaultier, told by himself, as a lasting creative testament.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/imrOCb2kppA1fioLiWjyUZA9OIs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jean-Paul Gaultier travaille","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
