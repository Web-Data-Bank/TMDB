She passes a mysterious handsome hitchhiker. In order to keep herself stimulated, she thinks of the hitchhiker and all the lovers she once had. Her thoughts become vivid remembrances in front of Paul Thomas' masterful camera. And inexplicably, in front of the hitchhiker's watchful eye, as he seems to observer everything from an omnipresent position.
