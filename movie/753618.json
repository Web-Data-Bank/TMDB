Alzira and family have been baking for generations, but the survival of their labour-intensive business hangs in the balance, due to difficulties finding staff. Not far away is another bakery, run entirely by ‘outsiders’—including Kiran and his co-workers who, every daybreak, cycle for miles to make deliveries of pão. Displaying the renowned tenacity of migrants, Kiran and colleagues have adapted to a new profession, a new language and even a new diet. Meanwhile, Marius—a recent returnee to his home state—hits the streets determined in his mission to resurrect the bread of his childhood.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hX0gU2w5CXeq47Dm7lVNgOhvvNM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"BREAD AND BELONGING","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
