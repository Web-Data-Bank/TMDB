The inexplicable phenomenon breeds hostility within her community, leading to an attempt on her life. After meeting with several Buddhist masters, Fathima undertakes a journey to Kargil, Leh and Dharamsala where, in a trance, she speaks Tibetan—a language unknown to her—and is recognised as the medium for a major Buddhist deity. Upon her return home, Fathima faces a personal struggle of identity and belief.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fathima the Oracle","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
