Though the Caribbean receives about five percent of the global tourist trade, it is the region most economically dependent on tourism. Heavily promoted since 1891 as the way to modernization and prosperity, tourism has tragically failed in its promises, as Jamaica is one of the most indebted countries in the world and the third poorest country in the Caribbean. Lively, hard hitting, with powerful voices, arresting visuals and iconic music, Jamaica For Sale documents the environmental, economic, social and cultural impacts of unsustainable tourism development.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nW7HkAqm2IMR00GWO7ghGm4WSZk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JM","name":"Jamaica"}],"release_date":"2009-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jamaica for Sale","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
