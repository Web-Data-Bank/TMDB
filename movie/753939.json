Not a narrative representation of the multiplicity of this landscape, but the search for a simple rhythm that lies beneath it. The action of warm colours gives way to a deeper molecular game that precedes this. Not the violence of lightning, but the silent force of a charged cloud. Not a hymn of praise for nature, but an icy breath that is the direct expression of this nature. Not the chaos of a forest in bloom, but the simplicity of a bar landscape. The camera seeks to move at this level, at this rhythm, a rhythm that is not only the core of nature, but also the core of cinema. Light, movement, sound. The film shows how the earth breathes, but also how this is perhaps the breath of cinema.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A9PXNnRVi5bHJkAnoEgyTwTFCKD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The One Close To The Sea","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
