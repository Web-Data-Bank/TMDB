But when she arrives at the hospital the situation is crazier than she expected. The two directors of the hospital, Dr. Hook (John Holmes) and Dr. Fraud, practice a rather unusual form of therapy wherein sex is the key for recovery. Soon, Nurse Blue discovers that the hospital is filled with hysterical patients who believe they're doctors and nurses.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wxs0H2ahgskkffXMP76cf5QmzZb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108623,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pendulous Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Medical insurance not necessary for admission","title":"Love in Strange Places","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
