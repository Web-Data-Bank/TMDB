In reality a civil war leaves behind wounds which cannot easily be healed and they revive, like ghosts, or like recurrent nightmares, during the long nights which have dogged Greek society for years.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oQiwmVVYjvjXkJ9ACV60N38TFC8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":141927,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bandung Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1993-05-15","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Balkan Landscapes: The Gaze of Theo Angelopoulos","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
