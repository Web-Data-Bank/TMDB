In 2014, he was granted an immediate release when the Shizuoka district court found that the evidence against him had been fabricated. Mr. Hakamada now lives peacefully with his sister in Hamamatsu. This documentary was filmed in 2015, one year after Mr. Hakamada's discharge. In interviewing Mr. Hakamada, now 79 years old and still suffering from prison psychosis, this record attempts to capture the immeasurable solitude of nearly half a century. Walking alongside Hakamada through his labyrinth of delusions, amidst fading memories and the powerful will to victory, it glimpses into Hakamada's complicated psychology, a web of opaque logic warped by his life's predicament.","popularity":0.849,"poster_path":"/2fjZeZ4Rz83n3CRxygi50bOZaOL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2018-06-29","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"48 Years: Silent Dictator","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
