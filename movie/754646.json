The route taken meets the Highlands at Killin, and then goes over Rannoch Moor and through Glencoe to Ben Nevis, the entrance to the Great Glen. Here we meet the West Highland railway line, and follow it on its journey through the Bonnie Prince Charlie country to Mallaig. Returning to the Great Glen we rejoin the coach route out through the Glen Foyne and Glen Shiel to the Kyle of Lochalsh, and take the ferry over to Skye.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gxZE8CdfApYpVC8WqyGCyB9qU50.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":141989,"logo_path":null,"name":"BTF Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1953-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Highland Journey","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
