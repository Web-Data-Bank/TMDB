But then Marvel revolutionized its storytelling palette: Formerly slick comic book heroes were given human traits and problems as well as superpowers. Plot lines became increasingly interwoven.  Superheroes like Spider-Man, X-Men and Jessica Jones now enjoy cult status even among an audience that has never read the comic books.
