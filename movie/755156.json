Over 1,000 different performances on 17 stages included a new marquee for up and coming bands. The enlarged Dance Tent was as packed as ever. Theatre highlights included thepunk opera “Kiss my Axe”. Mud surfing proved popular. There were better loos and a proper on-site bank. American singer Tony Bennett rose above the mud in immaculate white suit and tie. Over £500,000 from the Festival’s income went to Greenpeace, Oxfam, water Aid and many local organisations.  Acts included Blur, Primal Scream, Robbie Williams, Tori Amos, Pulp, Bob Dylan, Roni Size and the Chemical Brothers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zrToRIbIpXKTsjynUEg1gQJNCWB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1998-06-27","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blur: Live at Glastonbury '98","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
