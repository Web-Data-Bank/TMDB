The video shows how an expressionless man and woman, lying on their stomachs in an indefinable space (grey floor, brick walls), are tossed up and down in an unremitting rhythm, as though they lay in a cart rolling over a bumpy road at high speed. For the viewer, the repeated and fundamentally physically unpleasant experience gradually gives way to acceptance of the situation, through which the up and down movements even begin to assume a calming quality. The sculpture in the same space in Bureau Amsterdam, into which an extra is introduced, continues the horizontal structure of the video, but is opposite in character: apparently tranquil, but rumbling in the underbelly.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fgsLGQRvxVXEPRSlmkHfqNLGxMw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Float","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
