Commonplace but incredible at the same time, the scenes bear witness to the war in all its “rawness” with non-manipulated images, as the title of the work suggests. Soldiers and civilians intermingle. Shooting and fires form a background to the actions of ordinary people doing their jobs or walking through the streets.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gqdkXNxwGYHx24wYR1zKAGQXM0i.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Raw Footage","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
