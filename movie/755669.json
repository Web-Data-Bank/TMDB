Unlike troubled adults who long for their old homes, the children are oblivious of the past. As they find fun and scary pastimes around the village, they try to reconstruct memories of their past, of where they came from. They don’t remember the war, but it continues to affect their present and future.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3YHXKBWwe6sHmEvSeWXccRakjl0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79143,"logo_path":"/qIa22fhd6RWz6zTDCgVAN6U0u7J.png","name":"Mistrus Media","origin_country":"LV"},{"id":127616,"logo_path":null,"name":"Latvijas Kultūras akadēmija","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2020-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Restless Memories","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
