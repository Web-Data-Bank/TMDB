Long haul truckers, traveling salesmen, spurned husbands...they all know the place. Those bikers over there? Harmless, though I suggest you don't stare. Keep your eyes on the screen, which shouldn't be hard. You will see the steamiest, fleshiest, and most triple X-rated films direct from California and New York City. Popcorn? Sorry, I don't think that machine works anymore.
