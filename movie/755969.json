At the time, the Ontario Provincial police deemed the death an accident - stating that she had fallen out of a car. For forty-seven years, Audrey's family wondered about the circumstances of her death and about the rigor of the investigation. After the family accessed services of the Ontario Family Information Liaison Unit, the cause of Audrey's death was subsequently reclassified to 'undetermined' by the Chief Coroner of Ontario and the investigation was reopened. This story honors Audrey Anderson's life and highlights how the justice system needs to change to effectively support and respectfully engage with Indigenous families in tragic circumstances.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":90385,"logo_path":null,"name":"Thunderstone Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Audrey's Story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
