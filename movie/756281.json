How did we get here?  “Trapped: Cash Bail in America” shines a light on our deeply flawed criminal justice system and the activists working to reform it. This new documentary explores the growing movement to end the inherent economic and racial inequalities of cash bail while highlighting victims impacted by an unjust system, the tireless campaigners fighting for criminal justice reform, and a bail industry lobbying to maintain the status quo.","popularity":1.461,"poster_path":"/28I34gDCl0k7QCKCbxcV4aH2xcH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114247,"logo_path":"/kgZDD6zGSEH6zOq0d6BNUy2hdWK.png","name":"YouTube","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trapped: Cash Bail In America","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
