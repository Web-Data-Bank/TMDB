Jessica decides to spend a weekend at Paul Thomas' house, where she can think things over and also maybe beat the insomnia that's been keeping her up at night. When se arrives, the house is alive with kinky sexual escapades, including a wall-to-wall orgy that Paul tries to get her to join. She refuses but doesn't pass up a three-way lesbian dalliance with Erica Boyer and Heather Wayne. Gradually, her sexual hang-ups dissolve and she does the wild thing with Paul before being driven home by her now-devoted hubby. A vast and rich sexual panorama.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1986-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A spellbinding journey deep inside a woman's passion!","title":"Flesh Fire","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
