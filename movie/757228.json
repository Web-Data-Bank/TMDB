Their journey to SAY find some close to suicide, others withdrawn and fearful, exhausted and defeated from failed fluency training, societal pressures to not stutter or the decision to remain silent. Over the course of a year we witness first hand the incredible transformation that happens when these young people of wildly different backgrounds experience for the first time the revolutionary idea at the heart of SAY: that it's okay to stutter.","popularity":1.382,"poster_path":"/uhdJAufLLFdKW8vy1gHg3IMQ0pY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84889,"logo_path":null,"name":"Michael Alden Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":159384,"logo_path":null,"name":"Passion River Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Beautiful Stutter","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
