Today, renowned embalmer James Bryant puts his faith in a new generation to continue this vanishing legacy. However, his young intern, Clarence Pierre, meets him with resistance, conflicted about his commitment to carrying on embalming traditions and the judgment he feels from the Black community as a queer, Christian man.
