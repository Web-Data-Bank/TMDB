At the baths, at the barber's or in an empty house haunted by three swallows, speech flows in enclosed spaces. The director observes and captures the intimacy of the words, the obviousness of the gestures and the unexpectedness of the events. A metaphor for liberty, the absolute dream of contemporary Georgia.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7IqtWGnhTs0RZinB5i80IIOv3sF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2016-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Three Swallows","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
