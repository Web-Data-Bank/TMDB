A. T. is a wry homage to classic movies, and a celebration of the infuriating glory of cats. An alluring and remote low-voiced woman (une chatte fatale, as it were) sings to us of her unmistakable feline nature. A shadowy upright-bass player is seen now and then, accompanying the cat's slow and confident jazz song. Sandra Boynton wrote, designed, and directed this stylish and clever short film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"C.A.T.","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
