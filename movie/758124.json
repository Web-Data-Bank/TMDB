While examining the meaning of health, disease, and well-being in the post-industrial world, Apple Grown In Wind Tunnel imagines the development of a culture at the margins, linked by illicit radio broadcasts, toxic waste sites, the highway, and ultimately by the overwhelming desire to find a cure.  \"To the immune system in the 21st Century, here's a sublime video elegy: a tale of illness, and grass-roots conjuring against the contemporary malaise. This riveting toxic-road-movie seeps and slouches forward in search of a cure.\"  â€”Craig Baldwin","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dR19j3lrb46Q26EgFS3Fx4YbJwp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Apple Grown in Wind Tunnel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
