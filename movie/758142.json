The video was shot in the Amazon rainforest with a drone enacting a disembodied point of view that floats through the densely compressed forest canopy, taking off, hovering above the ground, and occasionally returning to it.  The work’s title is informed by a series of interviews with a dendrochronologist who studies methods of tracking climate change by ‘reading’ the annual tree rings in the Amazon rainforest –ecological recordings reveal a hidden dimension of narrative time within nature itself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tree Time","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
