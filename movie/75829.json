This film is clearly one of many imitators of Drunken Master. Although a little slow moving, Bruce Leung shows his stuff in this one. He gets trained from three masters who wants revenge on the villain that cripples them. But, as good as they train him, he still isn't good enough. So he finds out that his roommate knows the Tan Tao style. Bruce Leung is very good to watch in this one. An invincible villain in the end tops off this genuine classic.","popularity":1.028,"poster_path":"/ujroiGLeGTC8tqGmL3e4cW7Hmv3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100603,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shin Shin Film Enterprise (H.K.)
