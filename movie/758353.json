He's never been country's most versatile singer, but when he meets a lyric worthy of him, he transforms it into high art. Despite his identification with sombre songs, Jones has also shown a fondness throughout his career for light-hearted and novelty tunes such as \"The One I Loved Back Then (The Corvette Song)\", and it is this versatility that makes a George Jones concert such a memorable event.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bkAV9K6C2Wug9xObZ0DdBAyoiQG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"George Jones In Concert-Orange Blossom Special","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
