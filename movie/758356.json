The film follows researchers & journalists who delved into dusty archives to bring North Carolina’s extensive eugenics program into the sunlight. When the journalists succeed in connecting those files to living survivors and the vast network of perpetrators are revealed, a grassroots movement begins, tirelessly insisting the state confront its nefarious past. The documentary— four years in the making, brings into focus the human tragedy that unfolded behind closed doors for decades and gives voice to survivors who believed their poverty would leave their stories untold and their pain unrecognized.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dxwxX7sJsri44CBn0X7VDpp7vAV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The State of Eugenics","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
