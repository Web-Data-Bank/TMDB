Noise musician known for his insane, mind-blowing noise performances. An artist and inventor who creates completely unpredictable synthesizers, each of which is a unique object of art. Surprisingly, it is the USSR that is the birthplace of industrial music. Back in the 1920s, Dziga Vertov recorded musical compositions from the sounds of a sawmill, and Arseny Avraamov created a symphony entirely consisting of the sounds of the city: factory whistles, whistling steam and the sounds of aircraft. With this film, we want to introduce to the world a modern representative of a century-old underground tradition who has dedicated his life to noise, performance and synthesis.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rWieqxW0kHkMcnWu8BjuCEE2ApO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2020-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Papa Srapa","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
