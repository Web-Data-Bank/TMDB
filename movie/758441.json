These six months is the main penitentiary term of her lifetime, the last chance to feel life in all its versatility, and she makes a list of all things she needs to cram into that short timespan: a rock concert, a ballet, a soccer championship, going to the seaside, meeting up friends, and, most importantly, meeting her father to whom Natasha did not have the courage to tell the truth about her second imprisonment.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eIEgQzLfXLB0REWFA3xcdDKavK3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42673,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rock Films","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2020-12-05","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"#IAmHere","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
