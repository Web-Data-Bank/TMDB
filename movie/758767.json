Like the movement it documents, this story is told collectively: through the firsthand experiences and narratives of frontline activists, writers, celebrities, artists, and politicians who are remaking culture, policy, and most radically, our notions about gender. Premiering against the backdrop of an unprecedented pandemic and widespread social upheaval, \"Not Done\" shines a light on the next generation of feminists who are unafraid to take on complex problems and are leading the way to true equality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iNtVoxQlFRNbWjz3k3VnyV6PDBb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152007,"logo_path":null,"name":"Verizon Media","origin_country":""},{"id":83426,"logo_path":null,"name":"McGee Media","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Not Done: Women Remaking America","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
