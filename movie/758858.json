Over 50 artists have recorded his songs, but nobody does it better than Billy Joe, and that s why this show is so important. Recorded on August 14, 1984, Billy Joe holds back nothing.

But there s also the intimacy, the poetry, the stories.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oAss7y0VO96kiluwakvdQP9jzkV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":36238,"logo_path":null,"name":"KLRU Austin","origin_country":""},{"id":28897,"logo_path":null,"name":"New West Records","origin_country":""},{"id":94654,"logo_path":null,"name":"Austin City Limits","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Billy Joe Shaver: Live From Austin, TX","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
