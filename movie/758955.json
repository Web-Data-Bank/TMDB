Сильвестров","overview":"There is a rumor in the Kyiv musical community: once upon a time, in private conversation, Queen Elizabeth II mentioned Valentyn Silvestrov as one of her favorite composers of the modern age. The Royal Press Office hasn’t confirmed it, so no one knows for sure. But the stature of Silvestrov justifies this rumor. Highly respected by the world’s best music professionals, he remains a mystery for a wide audience. The documentary is far from a traditional biopic about a prominent person. It is an observation, a confession and, most of all, a story of great talent set against the backdrop of uncertain times.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1DpaTZrRx4C0AfICD7CggdpbKeB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109647,"logo_path":null,"name":"Magika Film","origin_country":"UA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2022-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"V.
