Rose Hall, home of Jazz at Lincoln Center for two sold-out shows dedicated to vintage blues. The extraordinary collaboration, billed as Wynton Marsalis &amp; Eric Clapton Play the Blues, paired these musical virtuosos with members of the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra as they brought to life a repertoire of songs selected by Clapton and arranged by Marsalis. Reprise Records captures the magic of these unprecedented shows on CD and a CD/DVD combo that both feature selections taken from the two public concerts, as well a special performance for Jazz at Lincoln Center's annual gala.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/yetWNn7hskaArpp5EweDDZvBstX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108696,"logo_path":"/gJs5yAYYjJvO2f5RX51vlRL610G.png","name":"Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wynton Marsalis and Eric Clapton Play the Blues - Live from Jazz at Lincoln Center","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4}
