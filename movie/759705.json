In the first part of the work, Padrissa plays with the present-day meaning of \"Trojans\" as computer viruses: his Trojan horse carries within it the infection that will cause system failures and, ultimately, destruction. In the second part, Carthage is presented as the mysterious seat of a future civilization, where human life is heading towards self-destruction through environmental disasters.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yyprwwt3tPq3oTt0td7jyxlQuwn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":174190,"logo_path":null,"name":"Palau de les Arts Reina Sofia","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":79588,"logo_path":null,"name":"Unitel Classica","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2009-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":254,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Monumental operas deserve epochal stagings","title":"Les Troyens","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
