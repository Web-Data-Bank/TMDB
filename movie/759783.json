Fusing country with rock paid rich  dividends for Steve Earle as he built a solid career on the back of an amalgamation of his two favorite  genres. In the 1980s country was deeply unfashionable, so it took some guts for Earle to dust it down  and provide listeners with a modern update of a sound that was considered to be way past its sell-by  date. Here, five of his music videos are collected together. Among them are \"Someday,\" \"Guitar Town,\"  \"Copperhead Road,\" and two others.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5665aORBU4C177HOvUQ2FItMiVo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":139602,"logo_path":null,"name":"MCA Home Video","origin_country":""},{"id":142963,"logo_path":null,"name":"MCA Nashville","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Steve Earle: The DVD Collection","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
