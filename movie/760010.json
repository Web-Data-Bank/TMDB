Once, people came here to find freedom and fortune and to live in a vast and breathtaking mountain landscape, but years of intensive mining have inflicted immeasurable damage on the landscape. North tells the story of this Canadian territory in a poetic but nonetheless confronting way. We hear the memories and stories of the former mine workers, and of the original and current inhabitants of the area.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cEA8oCL2yxV2bTE42UsmEQcA6Xh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"North","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
