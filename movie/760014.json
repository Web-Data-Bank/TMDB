Catalina Yagan, 89 years old, remembers the song of her grandfather Asenewensis. Her sons Victor and Roberto Vargas set out on a journey on horseback from the indigenous reserve they currently occupy, crossing the shores of the Onashaga channel in search of their ancestral reflection. Twakana means teaching, and through this story a connection with the ritual singing of Asenewensis is proposed. The Yaghan language travels through the raw nature and feeling of a living people.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rSEDJRBxgEjCoyiBXHZ5c26GwBf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":143017,"logo_path":null,"name":"Waia Films SRL","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2020-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Twakana Yagan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
