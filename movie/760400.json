The subjects share deeply personal stories and their perspectives on issues such as religion, race, identity and mortality. Unhurried interviews are interspersed with highly recognisable local scenes, and at times punctuated with serendipitous poetic moments.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tXqLrV788ChaTxfKm8T3am9JfK1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145115,"logo_path":null,"name":"JUMP UNDER","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"2020-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sementara","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
