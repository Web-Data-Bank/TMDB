Run by millionaire R. Bolla, the hot night spot lets its clients dabble in some decidedly decadent dilly-dallying while placing their various bets. The amorous action is threatened with a sudden halt, though, when Bolla's ex-wife (Crystal Breeze) sues him for alimony. She'll spill the beans on his erotic operation if he doesn't fork over $5 million! Bolla hires flashy private eye Eric Edwards to put her off the case, but Eric winds up falling for Crystal in a big way. In the end, you can bet that everyone gets what's coming to them. It's a non-stop cavalcade of carnality whenever this Casino of Lust is open for business!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ucKUsXR1TuJnIfNSPL6IIWv7y9n.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":132104,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sheer Essence","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Betting the \"Come Line\" Never Paid Off Like This!","title":"Casino of Lust","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
