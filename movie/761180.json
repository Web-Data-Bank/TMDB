By means of montage and optical recombination the film takes these historical fragments and builds them up to a frantic pitch. The film seeks to depict the frenetic digital information age but entirely through traditional photomechanical methods, a reversal of the norm. The sound design enhances the film's transformations, and provides a sensitive counterpoint to the \"colonial eye.\" The role of the colonist as exploiter of natural and human resources is evident, the filmic mediation brings these images into a contemporary context.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9mk3EbqvT6P84PMUqXjTEeFGAf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Synaesthetic Anaesthesia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
