He tells him about his world. A suburb where it rains, where everyone is a stranger, where no one works anymore; a nocturnal world that he is passing through, to flee, without looking back; he tells him about everything and about love, things one never talks about, except to a stranger like this one, a child perhaps, silent and motionless.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pPLO0vZ0b5nGlNOWVUzWFXhvoeO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102458,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nouvelle Donne Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2017-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Night Just Before the Forests","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
