When he was invited for the Rockpalast-Festival on October, 14th 1984, he had just released the desolate masterpiece \"Music For A New Society\" (1982). Compared to the official live album, JOHN CALE's performance at the Rockpalast was far more intense, desperate, and wild. He performed the songs with a very hard edge, sometimes even deconstructed them (\"Heartbreak Hotel\"). This DVD contains two shows, one from 1984 with his full band and a solo Cale show from 1983.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fmH5ffrnH5jTUO8mMhBHuZyccRL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":23218,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rockpalast","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2010-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"John Cale & Band: Live at Rockpalast","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
