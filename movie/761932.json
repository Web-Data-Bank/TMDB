Maren takes the displaced and somewhat enchanted Kerri back to her hotel room. He abruptly discovers he's stepped into a netherworld fraught with peril and the threat of violence deep down in Florida. With his life and Maren's in jeopardy, Kerri finds one slim chance to redeem his mistake and realize the misdirection of his pursuit of happiness, but it's also likely to cost him his life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tB2SffcBxNRWT0mafkkCkSO7hBR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A strange story of twilight love","title":"Deep Down in Florida","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
