Random or staged shots of people and settings in urban London are arranged and abstracted, double-exposed and solarized. The result is a dense texture filled with layers and associative dimensions.  Mass is a film attempting to convey, by strictly filmic means, the cooped-up feeling of the individual in the grey mass of the city. The absurd concrete city landscape is visualized through the unspoilt and naked eye of the camera in a concentrated mosaic of images and sound.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wsbIMyCdg1R9Ta00YmW6XT28LdZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28323,"logo_path":null,"name":"British Film Institute Production Board","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mass, or Monument for a Capitalist Society","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
