On the set, however, everything is different than she’d imagined. Camera operator Cordelia is the only one who is nice to her. Audrey is fascinated by Cordelia and attracted to her, but something seems to be wrong with Cordelia. Her body becomes feverishly hot, and approaching her becomes more and more dangerous.
