Franjo Tudjman, in Zagreb. It is an aesthetic observation of the wrapped sculpture as an overlay that reveals a new surface. By exposing it to different weather conditions it brings out the changes in sonic, visual and tactile experiences. The film combines video footage of the monument taken just few days before its unveiling, when it was still wrapped in a thick layer of nylon, and takes us through a wide range of dynamic actions performed around the statue, from construction preparations to the protests of masses of people.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Faceless","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
