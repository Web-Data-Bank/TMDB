Colette, a little older, is compassionate and disorganized. Families that ha've come from Sri Lanka, Mongolia, Eritrea, and elsewhere face both women when seeking exile in France. Each day more people arrive, with or without passports, with or without luggage, by the planeload or in tarpaulin covered trucks... How do we cope with this overflowing tide of distress and need ? The film recounts this face to face encounter, at times tense and explosive, moving and amusing, where everyone defends their position.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nJl4IA9wIbeB8C3n3wIa3lmEoZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Arrivals","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
