A troupe of buskers lands on an island governed by a despotic ruler with strict police control. When, during their performance, a shot fired from a circus cannon goes astray, it triggers a series of unexpected events. A young man and woman, Drin and Tuvi, and Nathan the seagull have to enter into an uneven struggle with totalitarian power. A struggle which eventually changes the fates of all the island inhabitants - both human and feathered.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5IfavoQyki6qVC00xyktVSV8y1M.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113108,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hafan Film","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2020-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Colourful Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
