In an attempt to preserve fragments of a disappearing culture, Mateo walks across communities in the arid and desolate Paraguayan Chaco region, and registers on cassettes the experiences of other Ayoreo who, like him, were born in the vast forest, free and nomadic, without any contact with white civilization, until religious missionaries forced them to abandon their ancestral territory, their means of subsistence, their beliefs and their home.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4XmhLL58OW5O24PwNnly5m4xwXL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77098,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cineworx Filmproduktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PY","name":"Paraguay"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2020-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nothing But the Sun","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
