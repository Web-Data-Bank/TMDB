Choosing to live lightly with the land, their family built a log cabin and explored the valley on foot-a journey they shared in books and documentaries. Now elders, the couple decide to close the circle and erase their footprints. In their third documentary, they dismantle their home and carefully restore the site to intact wilderness while exploring stewardship, responsibility, and human belonging to our living Earth. ReWilding Kernwood is a layered conversation on release, completion, and finding purpose in the shifting mystery of life.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/fC3kHyOUem4Gp8RyRNUQaLj8S4n.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-02-21","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ReWilding Kernwood","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
