My journey started in Tel Aviv in 1996, when extra-terrestrials abducted me from my bedroom. The event left me in shock. I closed my production company and hit the road, searching for an answer. I went to Roswell, New York, Paris, and Cuba. I filmed people who were abducted and got implants in their bodies. Suddenly, a Mossad agent shows up, trying to sabotage the production. Then my mom dies, and I find out I was adopted. My father turns out to be a dangerous criminal. My kids and their mom leave for California. I drink and fuck all the time. I hear voices in my head. My name Is Ariel Semmel and Parano is my crazy true story.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1rnD2RUzjkjUDSggSnr7vK52gam.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14910,"logo_path":null,"name":"New Israeli Foundation for Cinema and Television","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Parano","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
