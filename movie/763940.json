The smells of the business - cheeses, sausages, garlic and pickled herrings - repulses Fernie, who dreams of leaving this environment and moving into a life that's more rarified. Her father, Pop Schmidt (Jean Hersholt) has plans for his daughter to marry Peter Halitovsky (Arthur Stone), a sausage salesman, but Fernie is repulsed by the idea. At a dance, Fernie meets Jack Dugan (Malcolm McGregor), who tells her that he is in stocks, a paper-counter, and she falls for him. Because of her rejection of her father's chosen candidate for matrimony, Pop puts Fernie out of the house.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/m3wExgAOHGJh30K2HgSlaKw5lou.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42184,"logo_path":null,"name":"John McCormick Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":3245,"logo_path":"/9dBTQp9XitrHkx20i1r9HhZ3Q6B.png","name":"First National Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1926-08-22","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It Must Be Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
