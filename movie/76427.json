The Police have lost control. The citizens are terrified... and no one can stop the madness. Even the Techno Police, a special anti-crime squad, find the situation hopeless until a wise cracking cop with an uncanny knack for out-guessing the criminals joins the force.  When a powerful experiment tank is hijacked, the Techno Police and their newest recruit go to work. Equipped with an ultra-sonic car and crime-fighting Technoids, the rookie cop sets out on a death defying high-speed chase through the streets... trying to capture the crooks and trying to stay alive.  But no one is aware of the awesome powers about to be unleashed.","popularity":2.67,"poster_path":"/uEXOSpTWVeo4u9G7K5Ep1cYjObJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12302,"logo_path":"/lkxJXc0o9M2vVoQOyWeZfiNAsXl.png","name":"ARTMIC Co., Ltd.","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":3529,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Nue","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":12303,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dragon Production","origin_country":""},{"id":882,"logo_path":"/iDw9Xxok1d9WAM2zFicI8p3khTH.png","name":"TOHO","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1982-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In 2001 cops don't need .44 magnums... they have robots!","title":"Techno Police 21C","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":5}
