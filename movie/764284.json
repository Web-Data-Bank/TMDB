From regal burial to exhumation and decapitation, this relic of our only non-royal ruler has travelled a most peculiar path. It has been a gruesome warning to traitors, a secret prize for a soldier, an attraction at an 18th-century peep show, and an object of veneration and derision until it was finally laid to rest in a secret ceremony. CROMWELL'S HEAD, is a one-hour documentary, telling the full story of this extraordinary artifact. CROMWELL'S HEAD unravels a mystery and brings to light a variety of strange tales. By looking at the passions, public and private, aroused by Cromwell and his head, it illuminates how British attitudes to monarchy, democracy and radicalism were formed - and how they have changed, since our civil war over 350 years ago","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5Cfz1ZpKYj4hPIP0iCopy1L9aJO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":108000,"logo_path":null,"name":"FireWater Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cromwell's Head","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
