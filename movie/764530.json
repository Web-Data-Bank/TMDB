Along with his friends Pitu (18) and La Crespa (16), they seek an alternative to death and crime, through the art of hip hop and street jam battles. Tato has to run, and his only option is to leave the city and live with his grandfather Octavio (78), a flower grower, whom he does not know, and who wishes to inherit his traditions.
