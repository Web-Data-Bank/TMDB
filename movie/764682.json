Backed by the Lester Young-influenced alto saxophonist Paul Desmond, bassist Eugene Wright and drummer Joe Morello, Brubeck and his combo perform some of their odd-metered hits. Desmond's dancing ditty, \"Take Five\" is rendered in a faster tempo than the studio version. Brubeck's ragtime-flavoured \"(It's a) Raggy Waltz,\" highlights his percussive piano lines, while \"Castillian Blues\" and the Turkish strains of \"Blue Rondo a la Turk\" reveal his multicultural, compositional genius. Gleason, the show's creator and host, was a well-respected, San Francisco-based jazz critic and author. He remarks during the show that Dave Brubeck was \"a provocative, experimental, and interesting musician.\" That statement is still true today.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tklDhcGyBzVzkrBuROEi0AS3jNS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6794,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rhino Music","origin_country":""},{"id":138416,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rhino Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":12584,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rhino Home Video","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2000-08-22","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jazz Casual: Dave Brubeck","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
