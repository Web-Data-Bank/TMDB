The video is a shot-for-shot remake of the film “The Perfect Human” by Danish filmmaker Jørgen Leth (1967). The original is narrated in an anthropological manner, or as if listening to a guide at a zoo, but Da Corte’s version is stranger and more philosophical. Leth’s film has uncomfortable implications, such as: is the perfect human white, attractive, detached? The original, which is shot with a sense of fashion (resembling contemporary clothing commercials), offers mixed signals about objectivity, and at the very least a provocation about the notion of human perfection.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/k9tjOsW0gD119RP9i3S8lnSYJ9E.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-07-06","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Slow Graffiti","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
