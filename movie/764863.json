Cavalrymen ride their horses, first over low hedges, then over increasingly rough terrain, until by the end they are sliding down hills to cross a stream and going into caves. The horses don't seem terribly anixous to do these things. Occasionally a rider falls off and the horse walks away, as if to say \"See! I told you this wasn't a good idea.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":143826,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ambrosio e C.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1906-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La scuola di cavalleria in Pinerolo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
