Charlie Chaplin appears in the film, although it is unlikely he himself was involved in the production. Making use of stop-motion animation, Zepped uses possibly previously unknown outtakes of three or four earlier Chaplin films: His New Profession (1914), A Jitney Elopement (1915) and The Tramp (1915), and according to Bonhams, By the Sea (1915).  Two copies are known: one was unknowingly purchased by a collector who bought an old film reel tin on eBay for £3.20 (about $5) in September 2009 and found the nitrate film inside. He put it up for auction in June 2011 but the sole bid did not reach the £100,000 ($160,000) reserve price. The second copy was found in a tin of assorted items bought from a secondhand shop in Sheffield in July 2011.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1916-12-23","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zepped","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
