Kennedy, having honed their craft in part on the Broadway stage and by hosting parties like NYC’s 11:11 (with stints at Bard and MacDowell along the way), knows the Western high-art canon as well as they know how to subvert it by elegantly reframing its conventions—e.g., a classical aria delivered as dark ballroom anthem, with large-format Expressionist paintings extracted from the white cube to stand in as backdrop. To connect the acts, Kennedy invited DJ CEM (of Herrensauna fame) to bathe the masked audience in an ambient soundscape.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fubu Fukú","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
