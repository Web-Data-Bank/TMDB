The film was directed by Jules Stoop, who shot footage of the Heerlen mines ‘Emma’, ‘Wilhelmina’, and ‘Hendrik’.  In the first part of the film, Stoop shows the underground mining activity: the descent by lift, the mining and removal of coal, and a horse stable located more than 200 metres underground, where we see a blacksmith at work. The second part contains images of the marshalling railway yards, the briquette works, and the above-ground offices.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4rgRFoQlcodLRoDQHtGpKc9mO9r.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102429,"logo_path":"/9n6WQxDFeqMZJMVDXNiVhQvvlke.png","name":"Filmfabriek-Hollandia","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1919-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Steenkolenmijnen in Limburg","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
