While other historians analyze changing presidential administrations, Bacevich sees one long Oil War. There  are scant differences between Democrats and Republicans when it comes to the sacrifice of soldiers’ lives. His radical analysis has won bipartisan followers and even an invitation to speak with President Obama. Bacevich describes what that meeting reveals about America’s need to break free from its past.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mUGrt6RGc6Q6FqevHsPgZrT2ch7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Oil War","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
