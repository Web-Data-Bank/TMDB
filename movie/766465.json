Ma is psychologist Doctor Tsui while Hung is Pearl, the feisty third daughter who is hard to get along with. The undaunted Tsui sees the virtues in Pearl and teases her to teach lessons on marital harmony. With multiple schemes, Tsui teases, coaxes and has Pearl taste her own medicine. The battle of wits and the sexes becomes a joy to watch with Ma's complacent and roguish portrayal as a refined witty scholar clashing with the energetic and bickering Hung.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9AogbJnCQ3BoIrfNvCQBku0r280.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":144104,"logo_path":null,"name":"Qinghua","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1948-08-20","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Spoiled Princess","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
