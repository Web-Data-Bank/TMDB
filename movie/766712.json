She finds herself in a new school, with the unexpected attention of a cocky bull rider- and an almost impossible need to hold on to the one connection she has with her mother: barrel racing. Doing anything she can to get around horses, Jessie does not give up on her dream, despite not having a horse of her own. But when her Uncle Mick finds a deal on a cutting horse that has been deemed useless, Jessie finds a new hope in life, and the chance at barrel racing she's been needing.","popularity":2.802,"poster_path":"/j2HaDV8OF9027KhuCwZR4TAZWdI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-08-03","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Useless","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":5}
