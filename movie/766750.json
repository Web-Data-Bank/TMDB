Kenny and Spenny are back, and surprisingly they might be just the right medicine for Canadians stuck at home. Kenny, the diabolical schemer, has bamboozled a half-hour special episode out of the CBC, where he once again plans to throw Spenny under the ‘ambulance’ to make it great. Some things never change.","popularity":0.905,"poster_path":"/ve9JAK7UGPHmcLIniVhCSHBahXM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2020-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kenny and Spenny Paldemic Special","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
