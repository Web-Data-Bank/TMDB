After years of blockade, they were forced to leave their city. But they managed to save their videos illustrating a unique experiment of cultural resistance under the bombs.  This film, built between the past and the present, follows the story of three friends who met during the 2011 revolution and never gave up on their cultural resistance and peaceful struggle. Despite ceaseless bombing, they not only saved books from the rubble, but created a secret library, which quickly became a safe haven for peace, freedom and democracy: a special experience that they filmed and documented meticulously.  Separated by war and exile, they are striving to reunite with each other. They reminisce on the past and tell us the extraordinary story of the library, based on dozens of hours of video archives. “A Library Under Bombs” is a story of hope and survival.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xs8T33bQEhEPtf5YumU3bLlM5XG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":184552,"logo_path":null,"name":"Brother Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Daraya: A Library Under Bombs","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
