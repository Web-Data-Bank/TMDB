A combination of documentation, acting by lay people, interviews and self-portrayals are used. It is shown above all from the viewpoint of black Africans and narrated by four natives. The chief of an untouched village high in the Mandara mountains represents the \"original\" Africa; Christophe Colombe plays the guide in his native village, Rhumsiki; an African who has visited Europe and has got to know white people; and finally, the famous poet, René Philombé, recites poems.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":144212,"logo_path":null,"name":"Werner Grusch Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CM","name":"Cameroon"},{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1982-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bonjour, Capitaliste...","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
