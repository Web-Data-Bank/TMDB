In the Fall of 2019, while traveling across the United States, I taught camera-less film workshops in which I asked participants to express their “inner self” on a strip of 16mm film. These “visual autobiographies” are a synthesis of expression and memory in an abstract form. To capture my own inner, I documented the journey on super 8 film, and drew animations of the landscapes that drifted by me during my travels. My footage is stitched together with the collected consciousness of the many people that I met in these workshops; my memories in conversation with theirs. Each person’s contribution calls to mind one of my own memories, which relates back to the collective memory of the universe.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fE7rNutDZJ3cTpIZ0Rb7tj4Txv1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Whole is Greater Than the Sum of its Parts","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
