Return to Paradise was filmed on November 6th, 2017, the final night of the band’s three-show run, and is a dedication to the continued love and spirit of Dresden Dolls fans, and venues like The Paradise Rock Club which play such an important role as the foundation of live music communities. Although plans for a full-scale Dresden Dolls tour have been temporarily postponed, this film shows the band doing what they love best and leaving it all on the stage.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6p9Gbgdc6OuTaYkU13nwg1Scx7A.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":119,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dresden Dolls: Return to Paradise","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
