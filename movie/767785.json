Pretty soon, however, Danny begins to realise that the assault has affected him in more ways than one.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/g2t7mSPGZ2yDjnrGsEokitdzT42.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2020-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flicker","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
