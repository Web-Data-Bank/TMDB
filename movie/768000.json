But Rodgers also left a family lineage that has enriched the craft in abundant fashion. In a loose song cycle format, this program will weave his work with the charming and witty creations of daughter Mary Rodgers (Once Upon a Mattress) and the complex and extraordinary palette of grandson Adam Guettel (The Light in the Piazza, Floyd Collins), as we look toward the progression of musicals over the decades and into the future.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1sL2DAwu0vGnDMGpWtFD70pq636.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":144334,"logo_path":null,"name":"92nd Street Y","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rodgers, Rodgers & Guettel: Statues and Stories","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
