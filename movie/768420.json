This journey recounts how, among abandoned buildings, mines transformed into tourist attractions, factories in Eastern Europe that have been reconverted to produce Italian cars, and the transformation of industrial cities and towns such as Sesto San Giovanni (the former Stalingrad of Italy) and Lumezzane (the “workshop” city of the Brescia area). The places, the images, the sounds. The director takes note and recounts by blending telephone calls, conferences, poems, old movies, commercials on Yugoslavian TV, Russian ballets, experimental performances. One sole flow that expands into multiple senses and directions. Just like a factory.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fn8DXLuisMLymCRMTlCOvc47jw5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Film","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
