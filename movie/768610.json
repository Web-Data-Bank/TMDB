The viewer witnesses the step-by-step process of creation as the artist collects, cuts, shapes and welds cast-off materials into a sensitive human figure. The film concludes with a cine-poem in which Boise's works are elements in an overall abstract experience.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8pwjZeN4BnnX6lpvlTPPpgfGHVE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1966-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sculpture of Ron Boise","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
