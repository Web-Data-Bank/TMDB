She and her husband, Matt (Coyote), have held their marriage and family together, even though times on their small Southwestern ranch have been tough. One night, Matt and a couple of his buddies get drunk in a local saloon before heading home. They're also stewing in anti-Hispanic racial resentment. Matt is having a hard time making a living and has just had to sell off the last chunk of his inherited ranch property to a family named Martinez. The tragic result of their mean-spirited horseplay is a small Mexican church. burned to the ground, two young people critically injured and three men tangled up in fear, loathing, and lies.
