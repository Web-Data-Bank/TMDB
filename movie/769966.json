Shot in sync and MOS, the footage reflects Tom's interest in perception, human consciousness, and signaled his evolving interest in fusing non-fiction, experimental and dramatic genres. All the original materials for this unfinished film were stored at the LA home of Ken Levin, another Hampshire College alum who along with several other students, worked with Tom on this project, which he called the Architecture of Mountains.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yMkHjEqlxrwR1VVYzoxbhgrShf9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":193949,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alchemedia","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Architecture Of Mountains","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
