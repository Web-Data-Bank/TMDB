When Palau's voters made it the first nation in history to adopt a nuclear free, green constitution, Washington's war planners saw it as 'the threat of a good example.'  Palau became the poster child for the growing Nuclear Free Pacific movement and a cause celebre for the global nuclear free zone movement.  The 10-year-long manipulation of the electoral process the U.S. then unleashed to force the rollback of Palau's nuclear ban became a text book case for subversion of the democratic process in developing countries...and at home.  Their experiences covering this story made the filmmakers life-long advocates of election integrity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qVIkXdBkRV6y0zo71Md97rl6T1f.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13640,"logo_path":"/sUaed08coGdAxraWn7vAvvdRFoQ.png","name":"Corporation for Public Broadcasting","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PW","name":"Palau"}],"release_date":"1996-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Palauan Documentary","title":"Islands on the Edge of Time","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
