People are surrounded by emptiness, and loneliness has filled their hearts. / If it's that painful, you can stop. / If you really don't like it, you can run away. / Do you want to be at ease? To feel at peace? Do you want to become one with me? To have our bodies and souls become one? / But if I have to be with you, I'd rather die! / Don't worry. All living things have the ability to return to their original form, and for the heart to go on living. / Reality does involve pain, but you just have to accept it. / Anywhere can be heaven as long as you have the will to live.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aaP2I4XGZeRCV64MiC0BClQsddh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"nothing hurts, and you won’t be","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
