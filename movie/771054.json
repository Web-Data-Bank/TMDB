A year later, fifteen-year-old Braidie becomes obsessed with this case, but not for sympathy for the victim—because she sees something in herself that resonates with the teenage killers. Horrified by this, Braidie plunges into her memories and takes us on a journey through her life—from playing ponies to afterschool smoking—and discovers the increasing ostracization and violence towards one of Braidie’s own peers at the hands of her and her friends.","popularity":0.61,"poster_path":"/9Nlmp5ZVEgGkAInwJeGua4GXayJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2020-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Girl in the shape of a Monster.
