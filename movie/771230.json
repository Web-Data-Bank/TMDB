The Finnish pavilion was closed when the footage was shot because of a fallen tree. Was it a sign? The sinking city echoes The Artist's current sense of resignation. The piece shifts from video footage into cartoons with speech bubbles, perhaps in an effort to reclaim the voiceover from a romanticising of ennui that seemed to be setting in. Is this a new beginning? Liberated from its ambitions for an illustrious career, art has now become a more metaphysical means of survival.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/omnL8OKb6mNUSLVcSCpHzH5RgRG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"None of the World's Futures","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
