They have been in more than 100 countries, on five continents, driven for more than 100 000 kilometres. As a result, we were confident that no one could stop us. Until the fire trucks were blocked on the border between China and Vietnam. By one of the most difficult border crossings in the world.

That’s what this adventure documentary is about.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kykkqySkOOmaYnBAjhHxuwrDLUS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90476,"logo_path":null,"name":"SKUBA films","origin_country":"LV"},{"id":144940,"logo_path":null,"name":"fon Films","origin_country":"LV"},{"id":63249,"logo_path":null,"name":"VFS Films","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2020-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"“Borders?
