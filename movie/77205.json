It is the 1970s and the young people in charge of the place are heavily into flower power, sitar music and solving problems by frank talk sessions with the delinquents. However, the hippies, who themselves despise authority, soon find their own authority under attack by the rebellious youngsters, especially after the arrival of a mysterious young girl. Then a violent incident occurs that will have a decisively detrimental effect on relations at the institution.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sBxV7REfBJ4QidyZZBxQxyVHehX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117704,"logo_path":null,"name":"Umbi s.f.","origin_country":"IS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"2007-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Quiet Storm","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
