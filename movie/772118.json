For this release, baritone Hermann Prey tackles Schubert's Die Schone Mullerin, Schwanengesang accompanied by Leonard Hokanson and Winterreise accompanied by Helmut Deutsch. As a bonus, this release includes an interview with Prey on these song cycles and a documentary on the artist. \"In his finest interpretations Hermann Prey sang \"Winterreise\" and \"Die schone Mullerin\" with a captivatingly natural phrasing that flowed organically like a river and as such was the very opposite of the more intellectual approach of his rival, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau.\" (Die Zeit online) \"The velvety, silky timbre of his soft-grained and yet distinctively striking baritone voice, his charm, his excellent diction and the naturalness of his delivery spiced with a hint of emotion- it is all this that distinguishes the truly outstanding lieder singer.\" (Opernglas).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ndAYmFwoUl69TDR9mXm2DS7sTY0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Franz Schubert","title":"The Schubert Song Cycles (Hermann Prey)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
