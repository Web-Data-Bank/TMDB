Introducing the practical aspects of music like the svara and raga, the narrative goes on to elaborate on the various styles of presentation and examines the relationship shared by the master and the disciple. It attempts to understand the essence behind the elevation to a spiritual realm that exponents often find themselves in after years of practice and penance – a tenet that keeps the form pure and timeless is also explored.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lmg4McBAugfhub6nJSmuxjZS7Z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ocean of Melody","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
