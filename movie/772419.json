In 24 places, as a transit over the course of a day (Morning, Day, Night) a map of terror is drawn where massacres took place in Colombia in the 1990s. Archival images, the artists’ personal memories and the use of loops and analogue materials bring to life the landscapes ravaged by violence and build a polyphony of memory and mourning, a universal song of pain.","popularity":0.627,"poster_path":"/3Kp3d6DpXVnKlt1U5l6IgYnQklm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"CO","name":"Colombia"}],"release_date":"2021-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"an iteration of violence","title":"Song of the Flies","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
