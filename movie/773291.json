Now that he has moved to London, as a more than worthy pendant, the BPO has released a compelling set of the Beethoven piano concertos from 2010 with Mitsuko Uchida, a cycle that possesses all the advantages of live performance with, as far as I can hear, none of the drawbacks.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/f7Xpl84f7N22tFY8iCWTCoqpVQl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Ludwig van Beethoven","title":"Ludwig van Beethoven - Piano Concertos 1-5 - (Mitsuko Uchida, Berliner Philharmoniker)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
