Based on the real life experiences of Josie O Dwyer, the film uses her voice as commentary, taken from hours of taped conversation with the filmmaker. Different styles of drawing convey her emotions and the devastating effects detention and imprisonment have on young girls put away 'for their own protection'.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/m5t2aVEnKrAFPld12dmoT2Aw6yP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":130283,"logo_path":null,"name":"Smoothcloud Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Some Protection","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
