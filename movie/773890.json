The project “4 Nights at the Museum,” developed by the artist, filmmaker, and author Hito Steyerl, provides some background and conversations about the works in the exhibition. In four episodes (each lasting ca. 45 minutes), selected works and themes in I Will Survive will be discussed in more detail. Participants in the works, such as the New York-based graphic designer Ayham Ghraowi or the Hamburg-based actress Heja Netirk, will talk about their perspectives. In addition, Steyerl will present alternative versions of exhibited works and previously unedited archival material. Short guided tours by the curators will accompany visitors into the exhibition spaces, which are abandoned at night. They will take a look at some of the works and prove that there is nothing going on inside the museum during the shutdown.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fzE8qxMgF2dVfPusZOSdFMdJ4LN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":250,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Will Survive TV","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
