It concerns the wronged Euryanthe, victim of a plot to establish her unfaithfulness, but her love imbues her with colossal strength which Weber characterises with acute psychological insight. Through-composed and dispensing with spoken dialogue, its chivalric plot provides opportunities for a series of arias, ariosos, duets, cavatinas and choruses that contain some of his greatest operatic music. This production employs the opera's original version with a few, very minor cuts.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7buwji6uGGGsmJKEmRf8qn1r4fN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Carl Maria von Weber","title":"Carl Maria von Weber - Euryanthe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
