In the Second Piano Concerto Welser-Möst and Bronfman brought pulsing energy to the concerto’s second movement, setting up an oasis of calm for the third that segued immediately into the genial finale, whose last chords were nearly obliterated by roars of approval from the audience. Laced into his forceful performance of Piano Concerto No. 1 was a surprising element of fury, as if the pianist had become unhinged momentarily: and yet Bronfman was also wholly present, taking time in relaxed passages to savour every second.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/afS9v44PIQ0hXT9yy7k2gvEHCAp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Johannes Brahms","title":"Johannes Brahms - Piano Concerto No.1,2  (Yefim Bronfman)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
