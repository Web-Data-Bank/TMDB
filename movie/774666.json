In 2012, after the digitization of the original video tapes by the Bibliothèque Nationale of France for the Klonaris/Thomadaki Archive, the two artists proceed to a reinterpretation of this document, highlighting the characteristics of the 1/2-inch video format. This video is a trace of a public performance, where bodies, even under constraint, blinded and gagged, manifest their protest power against coercion. This performance against torture is one of the first examples of the art of the body theorized by the two artists.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rNRdL8QzQUNCppTxNUcQ6h3ULCV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Torture","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
