(1974-9) A space filled with moving…a series of panning shots of motel rooms in which the film-maker stayed during semi-annual transcontinental auto trips – homogenous accommodations lacking locational cues. Superimposed over the screen image are the names of the towns in which the rooms are located and the car’s odometer reading at each location. The sound track consists of two Gertrude Stein texts: “America I Came and Here I Am” and “American Food and American Houses” both from 1935. The film counterpoints printed word, spoken text, and photographs giving the viewer the alternate options of reading, viewing, and listening. Funded in part by a grant from the Ohio Arts Council. – J.C.L.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nZlTTa6o7V5aMDGJDi0M2ZTKnBf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Visible Inventory 6: Motel Dissolve","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
