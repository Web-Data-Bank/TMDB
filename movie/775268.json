And for many intersex persons, it is their life long secret. No one should be forced to hide in shame because their physical development does not follow guidelines dictated by our ideals of 'male' or 'female'. Intersex is a natural biological development. The film is an exploration of the history and science of ambiguous sexual development. We uncover the scientific facts through the voices of biologists, geneticists and researchers. We examine the social implications of their voluntary acceptance within our society.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/irnE16YX0Ss8JIx7Gx5iMOokZLz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Born Between: The Nature of Intersex","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
