Just another night at the ballpark with a few fans who love the game like everyone else. Nothing so different or unusual at all, except these fans are gay fans. The team and a group called Equality Illinois sponsored a night at the park, just like many other organizations - police, fire and churches do throughout the season.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rjw9ywWia8ZDhImOMWpOO7RtgfE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Take Me OUT to the Ballpark","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
