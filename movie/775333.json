The second short film \"Early Spring\" is not a cool youth movie about frolicking teenagers. It's a sociopsychological challenge to incite a discussion about group dynamics, conformism, and social roles that are largely shaped and confirmed in teenage years. Hopefully there is a moment of self-reflection here for everyone who has witnessed the blind acceptance of the group leader's whims, even when they clash with the observer's principles and conscience. Later it's almost impossible to analyse what happened, and why. Sander is not the only victim here. You could even speak about Alo in those terms, not to mention Laura. In another world, Sander and Laura might have been a young couple in love, but it is impossible in given social structure.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ycJtSq85WTh7RXBrXmV8T1VIRWh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6145,"logo_path":"/ZTOGLby368NkNZCuDNBdhzNnlp.png","name":"Moonwalker Film","origin_country":"EE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Bad Scene: Early Spring","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
