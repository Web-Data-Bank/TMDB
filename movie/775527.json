This recorded performance was the last concert we would be playing with our bassplayer, Levy Seynaeve. For one last time the circle of that AMENRA era was complete. We would now like to provide you with another opportunity to view this memorable meeting of friends. It was only us, and a crew of extremely talented friends. The sparse natural setting, special light set-up and drone footage makes for a unique concert experience like never before.  A link to be replaced in this chain of strength. A circle of fire to be drawn over and over again.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/o39McmwlBJYOzkylK1kZkVZBJi5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2020-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Amenra: Le Cercle","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
