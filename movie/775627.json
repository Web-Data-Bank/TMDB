A young preacher and, later in the day, a mysterious pregnant girl arrive at the church doors looking to begin new lives. The preacher, the Reverend Oliver Crawford, is not the judgmental church committee's first choice to be the Messiah's new pastor; an unwed father of a teenage son, he is given only two days to prove his worth to his new parishioners. Meanwhile, Katherine, a sixteen-year-old girl who is about to give birth, has come to the area to escape an abusive home and to search for a grandfather she doesn't know. With the help of local homeless advocate \"Big\" Willie Thorton, Crawford attempts to revive the spirit of the church and provide solace to the displaced girl.","popularity":0.845,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":145542,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rhinocerous Productions, Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1993-12-22","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hallelujah","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
