Clogging up the eyes and choking off the horizon, it has become a fact of everyday life. In a nondescript apartment somewhere in the city, a woman convenes a gathering at which a group of young people are present. Like every young generation, they are a repository of hope for the future â€“ albeit a future that seems equally murky and obscured.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/Ag7warGT2dKXi3tm8yJvIOxcau9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145564,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jerwood Arts","origin_country":""},{"id":129326,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film and Video Umbrella","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Walkout 1","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
