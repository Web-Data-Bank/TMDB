Pop star Garrett plays Tom, a teenager who teams with a black gunfighter named Isaac (Jim Brown) to avenge his family. The culprit was McClain (Van Cleef), a sadistic outlaw who carried out the brutal rape-massacre, but his role is minor, as most of the film deals with Tom's maturation and coming to terms with his feelings. Omnipresent 1970s character actors Glynnis O'Connor and John Marley co-star. If there is anything remarkable about Kid Vengeance, it is Francesco Masi's fine musical score, but the film is otherwise anemic.","popularity":1.929,"poster_path":"/gFo96tYNFUvwTt5shEvqfA5GsUG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10501,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Irwin Yablans Company","origin_country":"US"},{"id":13549,"logo_path":null,"name":"Golan-Globus Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1976-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"He watched them massacre his father...
