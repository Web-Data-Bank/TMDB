The work is a montage of film, stills and sound with Adrus drawing upon his artistic research and residency with Uganda Arts Trust in Kampala, the city where he was born but forced to leave as a child 40 years ago due to the ‘political situation’.  Through retracing his footsteps, Adrus revisits Kampala, and the way in which buildings and places trigger profound memories. Memories appear fragmented at first, however through ‘digitised’ archives and contemporary footage, new perspectives and stories emerge. Being displaced to Switzerland / Europe the issue of mobility, belonging and race are still very much current. This life changing event has been a key influence in much of Adrus’s work, exploring exile, communities, script / language and associations with places.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7iWVQkeVvO6bciuAxChFEbAtd9K.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Riddle of Bakuli","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
