From the outside it may seem like they are lazy or idle and not deserving of help. However without support they are deprived of the human right to enable them to be part of society.  Cripplewas commissioned by Phoenix as part of Idle Index, which invites artists to create screensaver works.  The work uses several passages from Frances Ryanâ€™s \"Crippled\" (2019, Verso Books).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cFU3Lr30xpNZ7UcknmhWjCh5sG3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cripple","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
