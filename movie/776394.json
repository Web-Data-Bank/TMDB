The story is generated by an algorithm and offers an interpretation of an encounter of love and disappointment. Small deviations in the language and the narrative logic reveal our social imprint of how stories are expected to be told and how technology is programmed to follow these perceptions. The mise-en-sc√©ne is a computer-generated galaxy of objects and images reminiscent of the organic, but dismembered and fragmented, reflecting on the possibility of creating new worlds and stories in digital space by following a subjective system of ordering.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6wkc1V2i3RfUaF4nRT2QuuiKWtX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2020-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"GALAXY","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
