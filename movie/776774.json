Both Engelman and Jewel grew up going to the island’s beach and protected nature preserve where a large band of wild ponies have lived for several hundred years. The island’s swampland and beach area are disappearing due to rising sea levels and more furious storms. The footage is shot on Super 8 and the vocal tracks are poem readings by Jewel, who also appears in some of the footage.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1SHJAhdotYBzO8wrv1RreBJnIHC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Water Drips, Vanishes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
