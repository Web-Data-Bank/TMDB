These are remembrance dates that are viewed differently by Latvians, Russians and Jews. The film searches for answers through three main characters, each a representative of their nationality, and categorical in their opposing way of thinking. Why is a date that is celebrated and honoured by one side, also a symbol of deep pain and injustice for another? Why are there, to this day, in a country as small as Latvia, three or more completely differing historical interpretations?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7KxMYobni5bkdwuILYqrs4BbAgJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":59209,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Studio Devini","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2010-09-27","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Controversial History","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
