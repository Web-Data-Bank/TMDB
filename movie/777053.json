The balance and stability he seeks in life seems out of reach and impossible to grasp - except for a very specific 30 minute part of his day. His lunch break. During this brief sabbatical he could see happiness off in the distance like an ocean liner in a sea of fog - only to disappear when reality summoned him back to the mundane. But even a “sad lunch” can offer nourishment to a broken man when he’s starving for hope.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hdYEU6zrz8pCPoN37fb8xHveg0X.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-11-07","revenue":20,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Lunch Breakdown.","title":"Sad Lunch","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
