They live on and thanks to the lake, they know all his secrets. They tell them, drifting with the flow on their pirogue or during a late evening gathering along the lake's banks: stories about two countries at war - The DRC and Rwanda, the rumour of a killer fish, a gigantic reserve of methane about to blow up, the legend of Mami Wata, or the fabulous memories of an old woman... So many stories about life and death, fishing and legacy, which form a collection that reveals the secret identity of an amazing place.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bImhAYL2yHrx1Itxdt1RiZ7SbpL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"SN","name":"Senegal"}],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"},{"english_name":"Swahili","iso_639_1":"sw","name":"Kiswahili"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rumeurs du lac","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
