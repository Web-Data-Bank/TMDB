Original intertitles precede each change of scene, but the locations provided are incorrect for three of the five views. The state of the ruins and camp suggest a date in late April, 1906. The absence of streetcar tracks in the \"Grand Avenue\" panorama dates that segment to before May 1, 1906.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/m4NTLCgdpbk49KXlFMmM45kRSGe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1906-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"San Francisco After the Earthquake and Fire of 1906","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
