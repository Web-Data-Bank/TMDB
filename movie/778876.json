Enjoy the highlights of his six-month space odyssey, the Proxima Mission, 400 km above the Earth. Pesquet docked with the ISS in November 2016 for a 196-day, 17-hour, and 49-minute mission. The filmmakers and Pesquet had agreed to a shooting plan before the mission, but the result exceeded their expectations! Pesquet kept a daily visual diary -he brought back more than 600 hours of footage, including 40 in IMAX format, sharing his thoughts and feelings on the beauty and fragile nature of our planet, and man’s place in the universe.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/82Ti8vEQi09jTO2AwRlkmRJjfBI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98235,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Vingt-Cinquième Heure","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Through the Eyes of an Astronaut","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":4}
