It was made for people to see after they've watched the movie itself, therefore containing/revealing spoilers as to how certain characters die, as well as the identity of the killer. The piece seeks to gain insight from writer/director, Glen Morgan on the whys and hows of not only re-making a popular cult classic, but how it fits within his own career. Filmed fly on the wall-style, the featurette mainly covers Morgan's struggle, for good or for worse, to make his film commercially popular while still trying to include elements like a theme and tone in what is essentially a slasher horror movie. The theme of \"family\" permeates throughout the movie, but also behind-the-screen as well.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-04-03","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"May All Your Christmases Be Black","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
