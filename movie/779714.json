The result is a 360 study of of one of contemporary culture’s last remaining temporary autonomous zones: a place where community is forged through music, personal and societal restraints begin to fall, and transformation and even spiritual transcendence become a possibility. Salvadori’s film offers a unique vision into contemporary club culture, exploring the intimacy between ravers and the invaluable team behind the venue.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inside Fold","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
