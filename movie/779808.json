She meets Robert, a 40 year old friend of Eve’s classmate’s father, at a party. Their interpersonal relationship sticks to the conventions, but a slightly strange interference can be felt. This odd, latent discomfort feeling raises during the family dinner and later at a supermarket store. Tension builds up between these characters, and both face an unfamiliar situation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5KWdvfGdSd0PABDnKkcOa8FogA7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cathrine's Private Life","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
