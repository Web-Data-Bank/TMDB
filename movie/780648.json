It is projected alternately on adjacent walls, the two loops accompanied by two different songs. The Valley of Jehosephat is a roots reggae track by Max Romeo from the late seventies – referring to a biblical valley of judgment. The other is Bryan Ferry’s In Your Mind (1977), which suggests a philosophical quest for personal resolution. The songs accompany footage of the Bloody Sunday Commemoration in Derry. The alternating soundtracks destabilise our reading of the work and force us to re-evaluate / question what it is we think we see, when we realise how the atmosphere is inflected by the different pieces of music.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Valley of Jehosephat/Version – In Your Mind","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
