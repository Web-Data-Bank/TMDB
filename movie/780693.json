These two have made a nest into the empty can of tomato soup, which Albi wears as a hat. To Albi, home is where the snow is, but the lack of furniture gives the place a not-so-homely feel.

The idea flourishes and soon he has a cozy home.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tLOKZvVaewxmjbP97vibaN2hs6i.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Albi The Snowman","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
