Abstract, dramatic, humorous - this programme gives a wonderfully varied introduction not just to MacMillan's work but to the beauty and dramatic power of ballet itself. Concerto, to Shostakovich's Second Piano Concerto, contrasts moments of exuberance and elegiac reflection. The Judas Tree places a single woman among 13 men to enact a harrowing event that is recognizably contemporary but with biblical overtones. Elite Syncopations completes the programme with a sparkling evocation of a dance hall that brings ragtime rhythms to the dance, and a ragtime band to the stage.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7dkkgmY141jmwXSMjasuJhK65m8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20799,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Royal Ballet","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Ballet","title":"Three Ballets by Kenneth MacMillan: Elite Syncopations/The Judas Tree/Concerto","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
