The 1964 Cuban/Soviet coproduction marked a watershed moment of cultural collaboration between two nations. Yet the film never found a mass audience, languishing for decades until its reintroduction as a \"classic\" in the 1990s. Vicente Ferraz explores the strange history of this cinematic tour de force, and the deeper meaning for those who participated in its creation.","popularity":1.084,"poster_path":"/fqlghiH4JbDUJovlUfo8pl4UaOp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33794,"logo_path":null,"name":"Três Mundos Produções","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2005-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Am Cuba, the Siberian Mammoth","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":14}
