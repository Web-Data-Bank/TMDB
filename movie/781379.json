Once, Changfamei finally managed to get some water for her sick mother. She carried water through the old banyan tree and saw that the branches and leaves of the tree were withered and yellow, so she poured some water on the roots of the tree, and the old banyan tree immediately became green all over. Later, the long-haired girl found a spring on the cliff of a steep mountain. She was surprised and delighted. Suddenly, a black wind blew her into the eerie cave. The mountain demon threatened her not to tell anyone about the discovery of the spring.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lNLr4sQ8BkPA4rraFtHNFyseaUc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6223,"logo_path":"/lOxuAoSiKVeePamkUq5VCyUFiPw.png","name":"Shanghai Animation Film Studio","origin_country":"CN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"1963-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Girl With Long Hair","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
