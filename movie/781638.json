The ancient animals enact their folkloric vendetta in a furious dance of dominance, yet long-overdue vengeance is shrouded in smoke. Meanwhile, an effigy of a tree is burning, summoning a whole other host of spectres and ancestors. Conceived during the month of the Hungry Ghost Festival in 2019, while large-scale fires were consuming the forests of Indonesia, Yeo Siew Huaâ€™s An Invocation to the Earth confronts climate collapse through the lens of pre-colonial folktales and animistic rituals. Through spoken spells and bodily entanglements, the video conjures up the fallen environmental defenders of a region ridden with ecological threats in the hope that their spirits will be reborn once again.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bjmhlLWRbxunhF4LPcml46tbEBL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":146583,"logo_path":null,"name":"NTU Centre for Contemporary Art Singapore","origin_country":""},{"id":146584,"logo_path":null,"name":"Thyssen-Bornemisza Art Contemporary (TBA21)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An Invocation to the Earth","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
