Kadir, their housekeeper, wants to join in. Their neighbour, Tati, and her housekeeper, Doyok, also want to join in. Rio, Anita, and Kadir pass the selection, after deceiving Tati and Doyok. Then a misunderstanding happens. Rio, Anita, and Kadir are misconstrued as having a fight when they are actually rehearsing a scene.
