The Black and predominantly queer art collective, an evolving line up of poets and artists from across the world, abstracts and reimagines opera in any traditional conception.  Set to hip-hop, blues, noise, R&B and electronica, the piece uses the voice (chanting, singing, screaming; written by poet and activist Dawn Lundy Martin) as its primary tool, verbalising centuries of alienation, vulnerability and protest in the global African diaspora through its disruptive libretto.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qIvLOO5kMxXB7XvslDv6BktSzFE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"'What happens to the Black body when it is haunted by \"a Blackness\" outside of it?'","title":"Good Stock On The Dimension Floor: An Opera","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
