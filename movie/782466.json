He tries to change and please everyone until he looses sight of himself.  Vik meets the mysterious Mirror Man who offers to help him regain his self-esteem and become the kind of person Vik dreams of becoming. Vik agrees, but the Mirror Man at times leaves Vik in situations where he surprises others not just by his new-found self-confidence, but also by insolence that causes a rift with his closest friends. Soon the Mirror Men in Vik’s life are too many to control, and when he tries to back away – it’s too late. Vik has alienated himself from his own essence and become one of them – a nameless, faceless human devoid of personality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/r7rRKX5Eba7jEM8pHGCCBih7RXt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":145412,"logo_path":null,"name":"Freshstep Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":63249,"logo_path":null,"name":"VFS Films","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2015-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mirror Man","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
