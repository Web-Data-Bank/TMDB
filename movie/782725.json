Gavito was one of the bilateral investigators who \"broke\" the case of missing rich kid Mark Kilroy (\"Phil\" in the feature and \"John\" in this short) sensationalized by Geraldo Rivera at the time. This brief documentary uses archival news, police photos and videotape to prove the truth of the crimes is even stranger than the fictionalized feature film.","popularity":0.627,"poster_path":"/wzyFqtCi3C1MRoZF4cKmPYCAQYe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1632,"logo_path":"/cisLn1YAUuptXVBa0xjq7ST9cH0.png","name":"Lionsgate","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rituales de Sangre: The True Story Behind the Matamoros Cult Killings","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
