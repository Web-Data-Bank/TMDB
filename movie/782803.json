Featuring over 70 in-depth interviews — including John Brannon (Negative Approach), Tesco Vee (Meatmen, Touch and Go), Ian MacKaye (Minor Threat, Dischord Records), pro skater Bill Danforth, scene kids, and members of the Necros, The Fix, Violent Apathy and Bored Youth — and never-before-seen Super8 footage of the Freezer, \"Dope, Hookers and Pavement\" is both hilarious and reflective, and an overdue record of a nearly invisible but magic little moment in the long history of Detroit rock'n'roll.","popularity":0.61,"poster_path":"/6LFLxSooZpirkyi28AYIPknm0mU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":146770,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ottomule Fil Mproduktion","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2020-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A lively and unfiltered account of the early days of the Detroit hardcore punk scene.","title":"Dope, Hookers and Pavement","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
