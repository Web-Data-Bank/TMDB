Released as an integral companion to Mister Mellow is a full length visual counterpart that utilizes almost every form of animation (collage, claymation, hand-drawn, stop-motion). The aesthetic of each video reflects the handmade, \"paint outside the lines\" style of Greene's music â€“ and again is a reaction against the sterile, hyper-realistic renderings of most modern digital-based art. The rich, detailed patchwork that makes up Mister Mellow (and its visual accompaniment) is unique in this day of quick-fix, throwaway music-culture.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9mx8AjoNV202DpNXVpZr8pUt0E6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":146773,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stones Throw Records","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Boredom.
