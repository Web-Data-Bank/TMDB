All material contained herein is 100% live. There are no overdubs of any kind.  Live album (Tilburg, 18.10.2015), sold only during the concerts from Towards The Blue Horizon Tour 2017 Issued in gatefold mini-LP sleeve pack (every disc in separate cardboard sleeve).  From the band: \"It was a remarkable concert. During the \"Love, Fear and the Time Machine Tour 2015\", the band were in excellent shape, and although we were promoting our more \"song-oriented side\", we played such compositions as \"Hyperactive\" or \"Egoist Hedonist\". On top of that, there is a 20-minute version of \"Escalator Shrine\" and a special, unique version of \"The Same River\" with a modified intro. The fact that it was one of the last concerts with Piotr Grudzi≈Ñski makes it even more emotional and memorable.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tJ8X58X5bxuHDA01tM1eZZGgojN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Riverside - Lost 'n' Found - Live in Tilburg","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":2}
