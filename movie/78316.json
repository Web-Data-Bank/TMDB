The crusty old Private Eye who was in love with her. A smooth-talking seductress who hires him to solve the crime. A bulldog detective with a nose for the truth and a leash held by city hall. A long list of suspects with a long list of alibis. A sprinkling of dirty secrets. A zest of clever lies. These are the ingredients of an homage to the PI films of Hollywood's Golden Age.","popularity":1.183,"poster_path":"/7Osd2F8jLyHbdQjhac6u9ifd4W3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Woman You Never Kiss Is The Woman You Kiss Forever","title":"Murder on the Yellow Brick Road","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
