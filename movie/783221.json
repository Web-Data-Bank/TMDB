All these facets are concentrated in a brilliant, complex, skinned character. \"It looks like Nino Ferrer\" is a film rich in international archives (TSR, RTSI, Rai...), rare documents (Super 8 films of the Ferrer family) and even unpublished films (Nino Ferrer as an actor in an advertisement for Italian cheese). The film is also punctuated by the memories of famous musicians such as Manu Dibango as well as by the singer's successes and his live performances (L'Olympia, L'Arche de Noé).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":34915,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zeugma Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2004-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":54,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On dirait Nino Ferrer","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
