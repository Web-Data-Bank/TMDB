Andy Nguyen, trans director and film student, captures his trans friends in their natural state on 16mm film shot on a Bolex h16 camera. Accompanied by narration written and recited by Salem Rao, this film represents that trans people exist and this is what we look like. Regardless of the obvious everyday transphobia, trans people find community and uniqueness within each other and themselves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9LLR6EESbxDILndkyUkciEPuRyI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":147007,"logo_path":null,"name":"andyvisualz","origin_country":""},{"id":96056,"logo_path":"/o2VlzDYQZyqPnaXx5dyyQ0I1ML1.png","name":"Toronto Metropolitan University","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2020-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A documentation of the faces and voices of trans youth in Toronto.","title":"heroes","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
