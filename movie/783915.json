What phenomenon, either too slow or too fast to be recorded, have escaped their capture? Are there still dimensions of our experience on Earth that have never been visually documented, and for which photographic techologies are yet to be invented ?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2l6ZXDnUTKLAQ9DBCQDddcB3sss.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2020-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A very long exposure time","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
