Their Red Rocks foray follows the form of the classic Gaither manifestation-the family hosts performances by longtime favorites such as Wesley Pritchard, whose \"I Never Shall Forget the Day\" is a particular highlight, and Donnie Sumner, who contributes a delicate, moving \"The Anchor Holds.\" As a celebration of traditional religious values, the HOMECOMING series is perhaps unequalled in contemporary worship music. RED ROCKS HOMECOMING is a fine example of the Gaither Family and its satellite members doing what they do best--singing simple, unadorned, traditional songs of praise.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6q0nmFuDUDTVrbmooOLD8qfAi5g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":89341,"logo_path":"/9AFIfoY73ThHx19EEWdLnyVJsbP.png","name":"Gaither Television Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Red Rocks Homecoming","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
