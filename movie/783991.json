The presence of Iskak, a village kid who is adopted and brought there to accompany Ateng is also a worry as Iskak always has ideas for his own profit. Ateng becomes very dependent on Iskak, so when Iskak is told to leave after he is accused of stealing a neighborâ€™s watch (though unproven), Ateng is very upset. Then he climbs up a water tower and refuses to come down until Iskak returns.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3f8WP9wtvVaWBwUuYbYrsgLOpbk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7872,"logo_path":"/5zodgZbBTlY5PAviS6KxOCyOlGH.png","name":"Rapi Films","origin_country":"ID"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"1977-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ateng Bikin Pusing","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
