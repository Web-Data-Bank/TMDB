Horses gallop across the beaten earth. Eva, 21 years old, wants to join the hunters of the Imperial Guard, a Napoleonic regiment of historical re-enactment reserved for men. In her quest for romanticism, she hides her identity so that she can set foot in the stirrup, braving a 200-year-old ban. In this world of gunpowder and smoke, Eva discovers herself as she has always dreamed: a handsome soldier at the side of a beautiful princess.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/wepHrdJDRTR2k5rTcX86R2NoMzI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21530,"logo_path":null,"name":"Climage","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":74381,"logo_path":"/eLKnDeZj20ntnbGZ1I5JtICANyj.png","name":"École Cantonale d'Art de Lausanne","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2021-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Imperial","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
