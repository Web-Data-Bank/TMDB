The film is a visual representation of the ‘Coca empire’s artificially flavored, canned music. A black and white walk in the subterranean ruin of the Empire builders alone with Felix the cat. Pursued by submissive, radar-controlled dogs, in a shadowy world with no return. Hanging in the umbilical cord of Imperialism, force-fed and preserved on the point of total disintegration before final misery.’ (Olle Hedman, 1991)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ePKauA4mWqqzDo6zNB3I1L8yRd8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2302,"logo_path":"/rPXEdpqwFycAY9ZgrAJXv13qcWW.png","name":"Svenska Filminstitutet","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Coca Strip","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
