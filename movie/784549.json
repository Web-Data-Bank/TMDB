The movie documents the lives of the men and women working on these \"big outfit\" ranches - some of which are over one million acres - and still require full crews of horseback mounted workers to tend large herds of cattle.  Narrated through first-hand accounts from the cowboys themselves, the story is steeped in authenticity and explores the rewards and hardships of a celebrated but misunderstood way of life, including the challenges that lie ahead for the cowboys critical to providing the world's supply of beef.  “COWBOYS” was filmed on eight of the nation’s largest cattle ranches across ten states in the American West.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fyyohAZaXGkr8SUtmvvXsk6x3Kd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":119989,"logo_path":null,"name":"1922 Films","origin_country":""},{"id":147110,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ultralite Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cowboys: A Documentary Portrait","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
