Not surprisingly, Bogwood is also the \"Garage Sale Capital of the U.S.A.\"  When retirees Doris & Clayton Fenwick decide to empty their nest of retro-modern antiques, they set the wheels in motion for a frantically funny \"g-sale\" involving Bogwood's most avid garage sale junkies: Angela Cocci (an obsessive market researcher), Ed LaSalle (a beleaguered computer programmer and creator of the cult fantasy roleplaying game \"Caves & Beasts\"), Dick Nickerson (a retired star of the 60s sitcom \"Pot o' Gold\"), and BJ Harwood & Helen Ziegler (partners and owners of a trendy retro-modern antique store).  These colorful characters try to outmaneuver each other to score their ultimate garage sale treasure: an antique board game worth a fortune.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":147117,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bogwood Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"G-Sale","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
