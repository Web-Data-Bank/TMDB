But mum suddenly dies, leaving Mille deep in debt to her evil auntie and cousin, who'd rather be rid of Mille once and for all. Luckily heaven sends a couple of angels and Topper, a good fairy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4JAs9d5NOspejdf77Vi4kSo3HCu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3675,"logo_path":null,"name":"Regner Grasten Film","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2003-02-07","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cinder Rock'n Rella","video":false,"vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":2}
