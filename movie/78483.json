It was intended to inform British citizens on how to protect themselves during a nuclear attack, and consisted of a mixture of pamphlets, radio broadcasts, and public information films. The series had originally been intended for distribution only in the event of dire national emergency, but provoked such intense public interest that the pamphlets were authorised for general release.","popularity":0.87,"poster_path":"/sZmkWdxCtZtDM0oGc3fjpoShJWu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19337,"logo_path":null,"name":"Richard Taylor Cartoon Films","origin_country":""},{"id":8598,"logo_path":null,"name":"COI","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Protect and Survive","video":false,"vote_average":3.0,"vote_count":1}
