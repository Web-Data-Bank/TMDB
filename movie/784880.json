Flashes of terror struck me for fractions of a second, which I immediately tried to forger. I wanted to film my state of mind, my thoughts, my relationship with my father now that he lay below. I wanted to live. Once I conceived the treatment, I shot the film in two days. I wanted the camera to go very loose...off the tripod...I was zooming rapidly and running around the cemetery. I wanted the gravestones to disappear and dance...and I wanted to stay out of there, myself. I began to understand that if you want to interpret feelings you have to look for and create filmic images beyond simple photographing. I used the sounds of the graveyard and sometimes no sound.” (Paul Winkler)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kwsDZE1WktVOa2KBDCHZexHlknp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Requiem No. 1","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
