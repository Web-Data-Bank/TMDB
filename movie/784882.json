The unabating atrocities of the Vietnam War, the growing protest movement in Australia, and the ghastly images we witnessed each day in newspapers and on TV formed my material. I wanted to get into the minds of the protesters, into their (my) anger. Protest rallies and the horror of the press were captured with a frantic camera and very fast zooming. The power of sound and image was heightened with often-rapid (sometimes single-frame) montage.” (Paul Winkler)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rOgfvf1nqDCZXFvDNufJjtYkrcm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1970-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Neurosis","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
