While the film will remain cutting edge in it's display of riding, the crew pushed hard to create a visual that is compelling to all sorts of boarders (something snowboarding lacks big time at the moment), reinforcing an idea we've been pushing in all our movies: unite in the spirit of unfettered adventure. All you really need is your board, your friends and a bit of help from Mother Nature.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8IXHS5Pis5B052Qnk55m3X3LeA3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Method Movie 3","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
