Lizzie's screwball exploits begin when her popularity soars over winning a fashion show audition and Gordo and Miranda become groupies instead of close friends. A hallway disaster and bargain shopping result in a \"clothes\" call. Then, imitation is not the sincerest form of flattery -- either when mentoring a new student on style or trying too hard to be just one of the guys! With great music from hot new bands and a flair for living and laughing, FASHIONABLY LIZZIE is the perfect fit.","popularity":0.822,"poster_path":"/h53Ab6mqf0I0r8nTrCK7VdxyqGx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lizzie McGuire - Fashionably Lizzie","video":true,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":4}
