We will follow the long journey of his life, from his childhood in a small village of Apulia, until the transfer to the United States; the transition from a peasant civilization of the early 1900s to that of a great metropolis projected into the future. The dreams of a poor child who leaves his mother and his land to seek fortune overseas, will come true on the circuits where his car will force every opponent to eat his dust.","popularity":0.891,"poster_path":"/upEXo1ktqI5jBI6kkJd9V2wodXY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":151670,"logo_path":null,"name":"MAC Film","origin_country":""},{"id":151671,"logo_path":null,"name":"Twisterfilm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2020-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ralph De Palma: The Fastest Man on Earth","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
