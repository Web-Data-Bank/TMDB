Burton Stephen Lancaster - later Burt Lancaster - was one of five children of a New York City postal worker. Burt recalled family life as warm and mutually supportive. At the Union Settlement House, he and boyhood friend Nick Cravat formed an acrobatic team. By eighteen, Burt was 6'2\" and blessed with the athletic physique and dynamic good looks that helped make him famous. A basketball scholarship was not enough to keep him in NYU beyond his sophomore year. That's when he and the 5'2\" Cravat joined a circus, earning $3 weekly between them. A stint in the Army introduced Burt to acting and led him to Hollywood where his first release, The Killers (1946), propelled him to stardom at age 32. He took control of his own career and seldom faltered.","popularity":1.09,"poster_path":"/zimliPnuBRpVeoNqgjLwsXndppf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":58967,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wombat Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Burt Lancaster: Daring to Reach","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
