But maybe more important things never seem to be told. Soon after the director moves into her 22nd house, she gets a phone call that her Grandma, who lives far away, is in a critical condition. Elsewhere, a huge apartment made of sand is being constructed as the tide rolls in, while she belatedly tries to build a relationship with her Gran. As the camera sensitively observes how we wait for the upcoming days, the film embraces the fragility of life, full of uncertainty.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aYauzursXuriOYejfuitKmTBVnb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Way We Wait","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
