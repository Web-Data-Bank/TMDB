Never before have classics like the 400E, Olympian, National Limited, and the Hiawatha pranced about in such realistic scenery - mountains, groundcover, tunnels and trees. Accessories include the Power Station, Hellgate Bridge, Terrace Station, and many more - even two loops for the Lionel Race Cars and a Snow Village Christmas scene.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Celebrity Train Layouts Part 2: Tom Snyder","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
