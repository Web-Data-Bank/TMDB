Full of life, but frequently facing profound adversity, these men and women share stories of love, loss, and personal growth which play out in high contrast to the freedom and athleticism they exhibit on the mountain. It's a film about challenge and ability, revealing these seniors in all their complexity: pleasure in companionship and physical activity, impatience with one's own limitations and the failings of others, and the struggle to come to terms with the losses that are intrinsic to a long life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/n6Qllcdie2yla7bZ6EFvGGOkyMu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127561,"logo_path":null,"name":"Micmato Media","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Life, death and skiing.","title":"Snow Day","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
