She accused a staff member of molestation, court records show. Jennifer's injuries appeared to be evidence of sexual abuse, indicating that someone had violently grabbed her.  The Office of Protective Services opened an investigation. But detectives took no action because the case relied heavily on the word of a woman with severe intellectual disabilities. A few months later, court records show, officials at the center had indisputable evidence that a crime had occurred.  \"In Jennifer’s Room\" is part of a reporting package that recently won a George Polk and an IRE award, and was named a finalist in the Pulitzer Prize’s Public Service category.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/Iv6qThVrMM6BXTrS8IxNzjTvF1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-11-29","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Jennifer's Room","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
