The director of this film, Arvīds Krievs, has directed two films starring Freimanis as an actor, and had an intimate connection with him as they were neighbours and Freimanis trusted him more than the journalists or reporters who interviewed him. Arvīds Krievs had planned to make a film about the singer for a few years, so he filmed the singer's life extensively.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vUXTc4lbdoqYWAcR0UWjrixr6k6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":63320,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kaupo Filma","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2014-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Freimis.
