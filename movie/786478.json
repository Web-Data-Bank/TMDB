No one knows if itâ€™s an incapability to comprehend the existence, a need to return to a more primitive state or a pure idealization of nihilism.  After the Great Blackout a man seeks out his past. By confronting his feminine and masculine alter egos he strives to restore his identity. The emergence of his most primal instincts is an absolutely straightforward and unequivocal reflection of the present day.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ysLWJ20tIo9kIGHmvH7CYhGM6aP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100383,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tritone Studios","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2018-10-02","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Leftovers & Leftlovers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
