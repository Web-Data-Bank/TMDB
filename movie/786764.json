For some, like Sun Ra, Afrofuturism (though the term was not coined until after Sun Ra passed away) is a form of escapism; a reprieve from violent systems of segregation and white supremacy. For others, Afrofuturism is a celebration of black innovation; filmmaker and author Ytasha Womack describes Afrofuturism as, “The intersection between black culture, technology, liberation, and the imagination, with some mysticism thrown in, too.” For some it is highly spiritual. Above all else, it is an ambitious vision of the future and mankind’s place in it that is continually informed by black culture and history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/my28mSMFGNAHkEmTLtFO8qzpRpI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"“Afrofuturism” Complete Series","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
