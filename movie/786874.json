With fiddles, upright bass, accordions, vihuela, mandolin, guitars, jarana huasteca, and vocals in Spanish, English, Nahuatl and P’urepecha, they play a wide spectrum of the traditional music that is at home in New Mexico. The musicians have learned from elder musicians (such as Antonia Apodaca) who instilled in them a respect for continuity of the community based social and dance music.  Noah Martinez, Jordan Wax, Leticia Gonzales and Greg Glassman have brought the language of New Mexico traditional music and related regional traditions back onto the modern stage, back onto dance floors, and back into the ears of a young generation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A film portrait of Lone Piñon, a Northern New Mexican string band celebrating their region’s cultural roots.","title":"And Those Who Dance it Surrender Their Hearts to Each Other","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
