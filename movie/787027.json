They choose not to spend a stack of money crossing borders, but instead they stay in Latvia and explore the countryside in the southeast, which is known as the land of blue lakes – Latgale.  It’s an unheard-of experience, putting skateboarders, rollerbladers, MTB and BMX riders together in a van for 12 days, just to see what happens. Each rider has his own story to tell, and together they form a 53-minute-long documentary film that reveals a wild story to remember. One that will hopefully inspire you to get up and make your own story.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/j3d8STf5nWAjSbY9BYld8zFtqEK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2015-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lost in Latgale","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
