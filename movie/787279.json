But by 9 a.m., the day's narrative had taken a tragic turn. Most of us are familiar with the national news coverage of 9/11, but the local reporting from TV and radio affiliates across the nation was no less important and no less compelling. This is an account of the tragedy as it unfolded, and as it aired in American cities large and small, told without narration or interviews.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yms1ULG6DmGYzoyo3JTZZBTWyYk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"9/11: The Heartland Tapes","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
