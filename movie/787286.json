Interweaving past, present and mythological time, the film draws upon historical and cultural references, including the plight of migrants during the Depression, the spread of the disease in recent years, contemporary theories of climate change, and the significance of the desert wind in ancient Assyria. In Ruperto and Keagyâ€™s film, natural phenomena remain neutral, fleeing from any kind of judgment and avoiding binary oppositions of positive and negative, destruction and regeneration, life and death.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zbNa0lEFhVbYjbn5RDvKw5wGlvs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-14","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ordinal (SW/NE)","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
