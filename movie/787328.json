The film gained notoriety in America for having scenes of nudity cut in various states.  It is one of four films (with The Devil's Pit, Down on the Farm, and On the Friendly Road) which claim to be the first \"New Zealand talkie\", although the claim is dubious in this case as the sound was added in America.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zXJA2xmwPLTfFT8eIHQmwaGamma.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":147611,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alexander Markey Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1935-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Weird Maori Drama","title":"Hei Tiki","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
