Chris Brown's section is one of the best with the tune \"I'm an Arsehole\" by Dennis Leary going down very well. Also features Max Jenke, Devun Walsh, Chris Dufficy, Dionne Delesalle, Joni Malmi, Paavo Tikannen, and plenty of others.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/l8ZYGsyI24NsiIYmZlfSFR8VLLM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Return Of The Wildcats","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
