They are the tiniest of birds, yet possess natural born super powers that enable them to fly backwards, upside-down, and float in mid-air. Their wings beat faster than the eye can see and the speed at which they travel makes people wonder if it was indeed a hummingbird they actually saw. They also are only found in the Americas. These attributes have both intrigued scientists and made it challenging to study the species, but with the latest high-speed cameras and other technologies, Super Hummingbirds reveals new scientific breakthroughs about these magical birds.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/26tvHc0eE0Mwdam9s9Rlv0oQlG1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Super Hummingbirds","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
