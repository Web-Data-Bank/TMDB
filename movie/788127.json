Carried away by the turbulence of the winds which prevent a uniform trajectory so close to the cliffs, the camera films according to the kinetic energy of the movements of the plane. The images do not reflect well what the heart and the imagination combine as energy to accommodate the vastness of sight and the magic of flight. The inability to see the mountain seems to be overcome in the experience. But the images I bring back tell that this challenge of technique against nature is swayed on all sides by the violence of the lurking danger.\" â€“JP","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A1uGXVub85Cp3jIxwAWZDMXqLhf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":93134,"logo_path":null,"name":"Centre Pompidou","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"15000ft","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
