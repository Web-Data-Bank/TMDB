George Washington made himself into a man capable of founding the most powerful nation in the world. In Pursuit of Honor we explore his early military career in the French & Indian War and understand how these experiences shaped his approach to the Revolution. We see how his management of Mount Vernon prepared him to administer the Continental Army.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":124293,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paladin Video","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Rise of George Washington","title":"Pursuit of Honor","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
