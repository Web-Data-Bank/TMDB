Through new interviews with the band including Richard Thompson, the film examines how the group survived tragedy when their drummer was killed in a car crash early in their career, followed by the tragic death of lead vocalist Sandy Denny; and how they overcame numerous line-up changes to continually reinvent themselves by discovering and recruiting some of the finest virtuosos in the country.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":70228,"logo_path":"/kXGq4AXfNqSYWPUhrE5DRNd0AJ7.png","name":"Special Treats Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-11-25","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fairport Convention: Folk Heroes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
