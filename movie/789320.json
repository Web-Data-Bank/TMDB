An assassin's bullet set off the war, and a system of military agreements brought the main European powers into the fight.  Both sides expected a quick victory, but the war lasted four years and took the lives of almost 10 million men.  Extreme patriotism gave men a cause to die for and propaganda raised support for the war while making the enemy seem villainous.  This fascinating 2-part documentary program chronicles the major events of this devastating period in the world's history through insightful narration and compelling archival footage and photographs.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ljDT3Vc4MynVpbhYBK3k864QRI6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12851,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mill Creek Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"World War I: A Lost Generation","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
