It centres the implications of identity, place and conflict for black folks living in Essex. Specifically, it disrupts the existing narratives. By giving a platform to these black voices, the work attempts to form new understandings of blackness viewed through a contemporary Essex lens.  â€‹","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dmCS5cn0KVlfbArGUKnMRS9Kwg6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black Girl Essex: Here We Come, Look We Here","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
