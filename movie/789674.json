They aren’t many students, and because of that the school resembles a large family rather than an institution. Near the Russian border, deep in the Latgale region, this place will become a nowhere-land once the youth depart. In an intimate message about a national problem, the story focuses on three sisters for whom life is about to drastically change. Through their daily lives and small adventures we try to understand the real meaning of the contention that “the countryside is dying”. And we see hope.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/f3dnf2Cs15WiL3ViKreKmkcCRJG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85171,"logo_path":"/1O7e8sk2hazDqDdK59ZehQHQQ7g.png","name":"Ego Media","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2014-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Day of School","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
