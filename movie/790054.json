A wide range of rare minerals can be found here in abundance, all commanding high prices in world commodity markets. Diamonds for jewellery, tantalum, tungsten and gold for electronics; uranium used in power generation and weaponry and many others. Congo has copious deposits of raw materials that are in high demand internationally but remains one of the poorest countries in the world.  For our translator, Bernard Kalume Buleri, his country’s history of turmoil is very personal; like most Congolese people, he and his family fell victim to the unending mineral based power struggle. Born in the year of his country’s independence, he has lived through war and seen his homeland torn apart by violent looting and greed. His story is a damning testament, illustrating how nature’s bounty, instead of being a blessing, becomes a deadly curse.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nyonXE2RfyuLyj7sW4fq6GBwkAB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85078,"logo_path":null,"name":"RT Documentary","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Congo, My Precious","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
