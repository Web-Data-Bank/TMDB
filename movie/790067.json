Inspired by director Marie-Ève Signeyrole's real-life experience volunteering in a soup kitchen around Christmas, La Soupe Pop invites its audience to share a bowl of soup among the actors and singers on Montpellier's Opera Comédie stage. Halfway between theatre and cabaret, the immersive experience unfolds in a series of raw yet poetic scenes accompanied by the joyously melancholy music of British cult band The Tiger Lillies.","popularity":0.61,"poster_path":"/3MQk0mB5t497lZUATtTBgczfDad.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-12-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Soupe Pop","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
