Jakob focuses on class dream-girl Hannah, without much luck. His secret recording of himself masturbating gets into class bullies Henry and Erik's hands through the mother's thoughtlessness. The rascals blackmail Jakob and post the video on the Internet. After a raging lecture phase, dad stands up for Jakob, but his life is already wrecked more than anyone realizes.","popularity":3.652,"poster_path":"/4tbyRMlETn7RwobflixlZ1uz0f4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":425,"logo_path":null,"name":"teamWorx","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2011-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Homevideo","video":false,"vote_average":6.583,"vote_count":36}
