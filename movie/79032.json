And the director does not spare the sterotypical image of early 60s middle aged male cliches to lampoon.\r But this is all very light stuff, nothing too intellectual.\r But it's often charming, and there's a bevy of well-known actors involved.\r Jean -Claude Brialy (the pompous, self absorbed male lead of Rohmer's \"Claire's Knee\"), Claude Rich, Lino Ventura, François Perrier, Pierre Brasseur, and the couple Bernard Blier &amp; Arletty, who team up here for the first time since Marcel Carné's \"Hôtel du Nord\" (1938).","popularity":1.015,"poster_path":"/oI2elXNfpMeP6otirCQ5b1QdtM0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74846,"logo_path":null,"name":"Woog","origin_country":""},{"id":74847,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Metzger","origin_country":""},{"id":1738,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paris Elysées Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1962-03-16","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hitch-Hike","video":false,"vote_average":5.75,"vote_count":4}
