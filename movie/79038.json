Its genesis is the story of a woman who is all the more obsessed by the desire to have a child than she is by not being able to have one, or to keep alive those she gives birth to. In the depths of her small farm in Provence, she has to put up with a lazy, drunken, porn-loving husband, until the day he decides to deprive her of her child substitute and offers to make her a real one. Tipping over into murderous madness, she then begins a real sentimental education, full of horrors and emotions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sYxmvwgAJe20cHBvCNMvXkTrqUt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mes parents","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
