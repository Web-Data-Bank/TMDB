Fast describes the project: “During several days he told me two stories which I have interwoven. The first took place in Bavaria and describes the sergeant’s relationship with a German girl who loves speed and self-mutilation. The second story takes place outside Baghdad and deals with a bomb on the roadside and a tragic mistake.” Fast took these two stories and processed them into a screenplay, which he then had interpreted by actors as a series of silent tableaux.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vmn4q6cp9sk5VYMJMNjjnA6SsR0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Casting","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
