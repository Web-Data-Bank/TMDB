As a trailblazing exponent of minimalist music, Reich rejected the characteristic complexity of mid-20th-century classical harmony and tonality in order to make large-scale works from minimal materials a single chord, a brief musical motif, a spoken exclamation – thereby reconciling sacred and popular music.  In this profile he looks back on the key stages of his 40-years lasting career, from the formation of his own group, Steve Reich and Musicians, to the American avant-garde he helped to create, from new video performances to his quasi-religious music. Despite his success and wide recognition Steve Reich has never renounced his independent spirit.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yjiGhNtalf9lr6JRoFPU3S6dhgh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":92126,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mémoire Magnétique","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2011-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Portrait of the musician","title":"Steve Reich: Phase to Face","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
