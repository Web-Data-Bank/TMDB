However, can anyone imagine that circus artists reside right there in the circus building - above the arena in the second floor hotel rooms - where they also prepare meals, do their laundry and try out their magic tricks? For over 125 years, despite the discomfort of non-renovated premises and ubiquitous animal odor, local and foreign circus artists follow their routine to create the circus miracle. Sugarcane, Coati and Monowheel is a film about those who dwell in Riga Circus and about what happens outside the arena before and after meeting audience under the circus dome.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/e8TtL8YSttK6wPgafnpC14UAEFP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":146706,"logo_path":null,"name":"Air Productions (LV)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2014-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sugarcane, Coati and Monowheel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
