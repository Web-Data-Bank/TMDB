The film gives a unique and particular view of the world of male prostitution, in the hands of two characters: a mature man who seeks pleasure through the vision of nakedness and the beauty of a young scoundrel.  But the story goes further and makes a reflection on beauty and its loss through the passage of the years, in old age, and as youth is the canon of desired and revered beauty. Young bodies are synonymous with beauty, and the taboos of our society limit the admiration of such young beauty by the elders.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3oj319nzK9ERuQ3p5EUeDcYyuUq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"David","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
