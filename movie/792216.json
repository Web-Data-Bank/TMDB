For a gay priest, there's nothing finer than hearing boys say, \"Yes, Father.\" Given how submissive these boys are, it's no surprise the older men often take advantage of their trust. These religious series feature all the dirty secrets the Church doesn't want you to see... When Father Fiore is finally alone with Mason, he is sure he has found the perfect disciple but he needs to know one important thing. Can Mason keep a secret? Marcus is terrified to reveal his feelings about boys to anyone but he finds Father Oaks to be understanding and even encouraging. Father Gallo selects Dakota to be altar boy, knowing the difficult path the boy has been on and just how thankful he would be for such an honor. Carter has been tempted and seduced several times by his lustful desires and now it's up to Father Oaks to help the lad with his insatiable hunger for hard cock!","popularity":0.79,"poster_path":"/hiLNCN8oFg0C1ZEWn2KLBp4nv7D.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bareback Network","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yes Father 1: Sins of the Flesh","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
