She, all in black, comes to gather grass in the grove, and he, sitting on a tree with a pipe in his hand, is constantly waiting for her to appear. The border guards are relentless and prevent her from trying to cross the border. And so passes the time filled with the memory of a happiness, so possible and unrealized because of the border stone that divides the country.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dOeFP7SWe8lxjeyR4AEgEYJRUnc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":28208,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vardar Film","origin_country":"MK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"YU","name":"Yugoslavia"}],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Macedonian","iso_639_1":"mk","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Something Should Happen Today","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
