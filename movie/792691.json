Some of them are confronted with the current political events in Europe, like the Brexit, the Catalan crisis in Spain, yellow vests in France – and in the end the (possible) consequences of Covid 19. At the same time, we see their personal lives: some of them get engaged or get married, but things don’t always go as the protagonists would like – or as the director would like. ‘In Transit’ shows the implications that politics have on the microlevel of people’s lives and gives the recent political events in Europe a human dimension. The film is also a personal journey into a continent that is going through some big changes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7HM6IBve7dO6Lo5iAkoQ1zVveRo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2020-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Transit, Identity and Love in Europe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
