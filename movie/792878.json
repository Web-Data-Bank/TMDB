The merciless sun beats down.  Her husband Willie barely speaks.  And yet! - she proclaims – ‘this will have been another happy day’.  Defiant, determined and fiercely resilient, Winnie greets each day with humour and boundless optimism, and lives as best she can between the bell for waking, and the bell for sleep.  Siobhán McSweeney (Derry Girls) plays Winnie in Samuel Beckett’s masterpiece.  Directed by Caitríona McLaughlin, with Marty Rea (Waiting for Godot) as Willie, the creative team also includes Jamie Vartan (design), Paul Keogan (lighting design) and Sinéad Diskin (sound design).","popularity":0.612,"poster_path":"/3NoVBWUCGOTRAqeU6BlNSwO7Fbq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-30","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Happy Days","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
