A classic morning after the night before scenario, but this isn’t a drunken mistake, this is a whole new way of life. Reflection, awkwardness and burgeoning love as two women.  Pretty is a film about beauty, not just the physical representation, but the soul deep beauty that makes us human. It is a story about finding confidence, revealing the true you.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pCqeEeU435Z4nsVloprpZEIKSQi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pretty","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
