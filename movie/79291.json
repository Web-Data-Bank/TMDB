Beautifully captured (by 9 cameras) directly from the controversial Tim Robbins' play in New York City, Embedded Live puts the audience in the front-row to this thought-provoking and timely production.","popularity":0.737,"poster_path":"/ydEO69eRpAn9pfMyCyOPQva6GeG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-09-20","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Embedded Live","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":4}
