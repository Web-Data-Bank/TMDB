At the end of April 2020, as Labour Day is approaching, I am sending a cinematographic letter from Paris to a friend living in Tokyo. The two capitals are in a state of sanitary emergency because of the Covid-19 virus. As Labour Day 2020 is approaching, the memory of Labour Day 2018 in Tokyo came back to me in a dream. I describe what I am able to detect from Paris, whose inhabitants are confined and watched, day and night. At the same time, impressions of 2018 in Tokyo come back, impressions of the fiftieth anniversary of Labour Day 1968, from the march to Gotokuji temple, up to an unforgettable meeting, a stroke of luck.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nBmiJaUSkP1pmc8AoCooRrkjt8F.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-05-25","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rêve de Gotokuji par un premier mai sans lune","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
