Some of us are drawn to red hair, some to big noses, while others can't get enough of a gap-toothed smile. Then are the more unusual attractions. Some people are attracted to robots. They don't just like robots â€“ they love robots. They want to make love to robots. And some people want to help them. My Sex Robot follows three robot fetishists in their quest to find a futuristic lover, and the engineers who believe they could make their dreams come true. Robot fetishists are a little understood subculture, but in this film they talk openly about their desire for a mechanical lover: for one who'll give sex on demand, never answers back, and doesn't expect a cuddle. There are a few giggle-behind-your-hand-moments but once you're past the playground desire to point and laugh at anyone a bit different, it's engrossing stuff.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Sex Robot","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
