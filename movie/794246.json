Invited to dinner for an announcement, their friends think it’s going to be a marriage announcement, but instead discover that decided to break up: but without drama or emotional rifts, staying friends with each other. A legitimate but naive ambition. Love stories end, because people change. And no change is, nor can it be, painless.","popularity":2.063,"poster_path":"/ut01wxXWOejoo01Mx57BpF1E6NH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52455,"logo_path":"/cgfr4IAVy0BMnadBApZK1D4JgAx.png","name":"Ascent Film","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":110638,"logo_path":null,"name":"NIghtswim","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":14016,"logo_path":"/snclwsIZQbgvqYCBJP8fqNlCA5y.png","name":"MiC","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2021-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"With or Without You","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":30}
