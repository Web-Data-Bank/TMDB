In a winter landscape, the film follows five kids and a young man who wanders alone between the desolate buildings of the Valibout neighbourhood, located in the province town of Plaisir. They will not cross paths but seem destined to meet the same fate, that of being abandoned to themselves; to hide and not to be found.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4kcm4P7Ujqzk5YKkhQ49MO5nwXq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hide-and-Seek","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
