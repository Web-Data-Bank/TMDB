He joins the mission to Burma (Myanmar) during World War II in the Red Cross division. When the Japanese forces are defeated, Tamin and his friends are brought back to Java and handed over to the Dutch who are attempting to rule the country one more time. Tamin is forced to join the Dutch military (KNIL) to fight his fellow citizens. After Indonesia gains full sovereignty (1950), Tamin chooses to return to the village. But his heart remains uncertain as his friends accuse him of not participating in the struggle for Indonesia's independence. So Tamin goes to the city where he meets a fellow former Heiho, who is now in the Indonesian military force. His friend shows him that there are other ways to contribute to the national struggle. Then Tamin returns to his home, his village and his country.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/65lXbsFigw67x5wWv6EFTR5716F.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":148968,"logo_path":null,"name":"Produksi Film Negara","origin_country":"ID"},{"id":148971,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gabungan Artis Film","origin_country":"ID"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"1952-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pulang","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
