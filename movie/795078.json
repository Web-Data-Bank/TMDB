This three-channel video has been adapted for Ibraaz into a single-channel work in which three windows display footage either shot by the artist or taken from social and international media. These moving images - showing policemen; protesters singing and praying; and people apparently being shot or attacked by water cannons - run simultaneously across the three screens, while clocks urgently count down the seconds of the work's duration. A persistent, echoing beat; the sounds of a baying crowd; and a lachrymose guitar solo accompany the footage at different points.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8yGyZUkjhA7rkBeCMcb6qwQ7ysK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EG","name":"Egypt"}],"release_date":"2011-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Video Diaries","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
