Life on the island is tough for these buxom, beautifully-swept coiffed maidens - virtually none who look like they had even the slightest knowledge of crimes worthy of such a punishment. Here, if the girls want to get a day of rest they must work the night with the guards and/or warden of the island, but some changes come when Guy Madison arrives as the new warden out to change the horrible lives led by these playmate-wannabes.","popularity":0.895,"poster_path":"/jJUTwW3NjoaBuKFJi30dNYfa0yE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13234,"logo_path":null,"name":"Le Louvre Film","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":1735,"logo_path":null,"name":"Documento Film","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1962-07-27","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Women of Devil's Island","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":8}
