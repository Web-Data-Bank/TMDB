This trilogy follows three seemingly separate stories: a horror film fan dealing with insomnia and 'another self', an artist struggling with her masterpiece and two clowns who may never find the punchline. The pieces centre around bittersweet comedy, bleak surrealism and experimental filmmaking and mark the third creative project from ChewBoy Productions. They deal with the facts that we may never find happiness in our lives or our work, and that ultimately, we always end up back where we started.  Before the screening, audiences were invited to answer a series of questions. We then put all the answers into our algorithm, creating a truly individual cut of the films which were representative of the room's overall worldview, perceptions, personality and feeling.  This version of the film is a suggested edit.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uHuHZFcGfByI3M3pneBwW1GHNta.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":149005,"logo_path":null,"name":"ChewBoy Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Process Trilogy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
