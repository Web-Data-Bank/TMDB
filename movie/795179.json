Created by animators Sid Marcus, Dick Huemer, and Art Davis. This cartoon is basically about a little dog who is a rather bad and cheeky museum cleaner. Not surprisingly, his boss is very impatient with him and urges him to keep cleaning. As the cleaner cleans, some of the things in the museum come to life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aGM6Zi8R8drF6cvzTTlkcHgKu76.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1930-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Museum","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
