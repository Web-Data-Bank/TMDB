Against a backdrop of Islam, revolution and war, they share their views on the veil, the relationship of Iranian women to the West and the long-ranging impacts of the 1979 Revolution on the status of women in their country. What emerges is an image of Iran that resists easy classification, a nation in flux at a unique historical moment, still reeling from the residual effects of the Iran-Iraq war but poised for a new future. An important and timely look at contemporary Iran, WOMEN LIKE US offers surprising insights into the changing role of women in the Middle East from a perspective that rarely makes it to international headlines.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yzE9yNVgIgupLGREu4Enx7ODMxN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"WOMEN LIKE US: WOMEN IN IRAN","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
