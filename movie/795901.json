Carlos Echeverría is a film director that started a documentary about him but did not finish it for dark reasons. Esperanza is the current under-20 national ski champion and during her training she meets Miguel, a ski lift operator. Through Miguel’s eyes, we discover the world of the people who work there so others can practice the sport of skiing. Most of the workers are Mapuche descendants and have never skied. The relationship between these characters shows the hidden universe of labour relations that are generated during the ski peak season.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9h0nPLvsILoOGhECDK2lYSFBPHg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":86170,"logo_path":"/us76ENKlfJTShgiyvKerXSE5kFD.png","name":"Un Puma","origin_country":"AR"},{"id":161416,"logo_path":null,"name":"Brasiliana","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2021-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ski","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
