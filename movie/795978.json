At the PedWest border crossing in Tijuana refugees perform their stories. They play asbestos workers, American soldiers, Red Cross staff, and firefighters. Migrants from Guatemala and Venezuela and Mexicans who were deported from the USA to Tijuana: they are all stuck at the border due to the “Remain in Mexico” policy.  Ahorita Frames moves the stories of the asbestos workers from New York in 2001 across the border to Tijuana in 2019, thus reconfiguring the political cartography of power relations.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ahorita Frames","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
