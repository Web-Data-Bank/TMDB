All the while, the bodies of teenage and college-age girls pile up around the tri-state in a pattern the police haven't quite figured out yet involves the band's lead singer, who doubles as a serial killer, his tour dates are his hunting ground, with new groupies dying every show. A cat-and-mouse slasher/thriller will keep the audience at the edge of their seats as the cops chase the bodies and try to catch up with a savage murderer addicted to the thrill and getting worse with each new kill!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":121,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ohio","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
