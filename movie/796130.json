In ‘Valentina’, an unedited 100ft reel of hand-processed 16mm film, shot in rehearsal, is used as a silent score for a reading. Performer and dancer Valentina Formenti recalls part of a transcribed interview with Carlos, later edited for publication in ‘Playboy’ in 1979. Whilst the magazine interview was seen as the first public announcement of Carlos’ gender transition, these absent passages, excluded from the final edit, include her connected interests in cartography, physics, mathematics’ transformations, astronomy, and her practice in solar eclipse photography.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kBjRY3FDWHqwmUBSKpPLbN1ROZO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Valentina","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
