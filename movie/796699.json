They were on their way to Suriname. Nearly two hundred years later, Diego Pos made a trip in the opposite direction: he was the last Pos to leave Suriname. In Ongewisse tijd, Pos returns to Suriname in search of the history of his Jewish family and of Suriname Jews in general. He happens upon unexpected relatives, like Simon Matthijs, who was born out of a slave in the eighteenth century. The search and encounters with various representatives of Jewish communities in Suriname run synchronous with the dramatised story of the brothers Hartog Simon and Matthijs, whose initially close relationship was seriously dampened by love affairs.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":1259,"logo_path":"/6a5XUQ1c8h8dJragfFs1fpd7SqW.png","name":"Shooting Star Filmcompany","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2006-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ongewisse tijd","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
