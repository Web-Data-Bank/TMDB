A baker`s dozen models are also on the trip, staying in the same hotel, taking advantage of the opportunity to get to know each other intimately. During the first part of the three-week stay, Marc Vidal gets together with Rick Fontana, Ethan Clarke with Yves Carradine, and Brandon Manilow with Josh Elliot. When Lukas gets visibly aroused photographing Ethan and Yves, the two models seduce him, but Lukas is still hurting too much to reciprocate. When Lukas and Tommy Hansen commiserate over the cheating ways of their mutual ex, they fall into each other`s arms. Although Lukas opens up more with Tommy (who wouldn`t!?) he realizes that Tommy is not going to be the one to fill the void in his heart.
