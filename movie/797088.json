Walking 2600 miles through deserts, fires, snow and rain, the Wizards combine all of the blister-popping, dirty, salt-encrusted misery of five and a half months of hiking with the joys of nature, friendship, and far more dancing than you would expect in a trail documentary. About 300 people attempt to 'thru-hike' the PCT every year. The Wizards not only succeed -- they have fun doing it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8onwq9fRjpAQWr2yBVlkGcI6JpY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":149324,"logo_path":null,"name":"TBW Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wizards of the PCT","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
