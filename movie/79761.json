But when the queen delivers a twin, Cardinal Richelieu sees the second son as a potential for revolution, and has him sent off to Spain to be raised in secret to ensure a peaceful future for France. Alas, keeping the secret means sending Constance, lover of D'Artagnan, off to a convent. D'Artagnan hears of this and rallies the Musketeers in a bid to rescue her. Unfortunately, Richelieu out-smarts the Musketeers and banishes them forever.","popularity":1.559,"poster_path":"/nJEyA6QJ1zAANZKWZMf0HiDjLtW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4203,"logo_path":null,"name":"Elton Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1929-02-21","revenue":3270000,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Further Adventures of \"The Three Musketeers\"!","title":"The Iron Mask","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":21}
