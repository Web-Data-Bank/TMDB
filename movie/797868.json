It is said that there is a woman like Our Lady who gently embraces a virgin man who is trying to commit suicide due to such triple pain as \"not popular\", \"not girlfriend\", \"dating and no money\" .. That is the urban legend of \"Maria the Savior\". On the roof of a building, there was a man who was about to commit suicide. His name is Morishita. He confessed to his longing Madonna, Sayuri Mizushima, and was kicked down by a slapstick and lost hope of living. And when I tried to get over the fence on the roof, there was a voice behind him stopping him.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qciGa2Qnf98kinNWWOs9TLMzBmK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Urban Legends of Virgin Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
