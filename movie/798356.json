Each mask has an individual personality and is given a name which is revealed in a dream. For many years the name of this mask was lost. However, in a special ceremony in January 2013 members of the Sierra Leonean diaspora community in London gave the mask a new name: Gbavo, meaning ‘crowd-puller’ or ‘to attract people’s attention’. The newly-named mask was then formally re-presented to the British Museum.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sowei mask: spirit of Sierra Leone","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
