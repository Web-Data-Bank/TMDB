The painstaking and  elaborate process of the making of the idols, the  festivities that grow around the worship of the deities  that these idols represent; and the ultimate farewell  of the deity in immersion, when the straw-wood-clay  structures that typify divinity, disintegrate and dissolve  in water and earth—are woven together in an  exploration of the lives of these master craftsmen who  go through hardships and privation in order to be true  to their art.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jqfcWA23BYiSKN5ZiHjS1c8TFr2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2005-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"IDOL MAKERS OF KOLKATA","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
