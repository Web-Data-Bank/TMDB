In desperate Gaza -not a country but a strip- people dig tunnels because the borders are too well-guarded. Not even a sheep may cross the border. So a shepherd who has run out of ideas takes his sheep along with him into the tunnel. Desperate, absurd and yet comic. Sombre and monochrome. Animation as if modelled with soil.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/bbk8mBBUdGT8oLCSwel0ffNqWU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tunnel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
