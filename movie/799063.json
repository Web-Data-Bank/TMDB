Only his science fiction dreams of a better life on Mars draw him away from his ordinary life, which is as equally difficult at home or at school, where he's only seen as an aggressive loser. One evening, he receives a visit from a mysterious man who insists that he has come from the future and that he is also Logan, but forty years older. He then asks the younger Logan to carry out a mission as unexpected as it is important: to save humanity.","popularity":0.605,"poster_path":"/ye8bHuT5rrNwjTcLhzQeLT0dtlT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110996,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Films Norfolk","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2020-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mars Colony","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
