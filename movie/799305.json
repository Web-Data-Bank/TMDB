What would you do then? That's the question posed by Saman Salur in 'Thirteen 59', an introspective study of the psychological side of war. A chief commander in the Iranian army wakes up from a coma years after the war in which he fought has ended. Unable to define himself by the conflict anymore, he struggles to move on from what he has always known and find the peace within himself. Habit is the hardest addiction to kick.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uPkmSbDz2k6QVgdJd7ndwiWtDwi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-06-29","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thirteen 59","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
