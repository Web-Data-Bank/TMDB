Reworking the classic Zombie public-domain film from 1968 'Night of the Living Dead' by a mix of AI colorization technology, datamosh techniques, re-cutting and sound work. Visions of the invisible virus were found in the horror film images, got broken apart and reassembled to become a haunting kaleidoscopic nightmare. A post-horror experimental film/series in three acts. This is Act III - Hell.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3ZzDLfwlgNhT7galRdaE88tnnZY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Devil Had Other Plans (Act III)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
