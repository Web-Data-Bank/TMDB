In Boss of Big Town, veteran supporting player John Litel is top-billed as crusading city market official Michael Lynn. When a criminal gang muscles in on the local food distribution markets, Lynn vows to throw the rascals out. First, however, he pretends to join the villains as a paid government stooge, the better to find out the identity of the \"Mister Big\" behind the distribution racket. The exposure of the \"mystery villain\" will come as a shock to fans of the 1927 Cecil B. DeMille epic The King of Kings--but not to dyed-in-the-wool movie buffs.","popularity":0.983,"poster_path":"/gYWcplNrZx6WvJuaSfYIemCvWaH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16466,"logo_path":null,"name":"PRC","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1942-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"BLACK MARKET RACKET!
