Throughout her long, illustrious career, she has never missed a performanceâ€”not for her daughter, not for illness, not for any reason. Yet in the rehearsals leading to her next Broadway production, her confidence is challenged. People and events conspire to take away her ability to do what she loves most. Suddenly, Hall is forced to reckon with the past and the price she has paid for the choices she made in her life and her art. Can she repair a lifetime of parental neglect? Can she reconcile herself to the demands of aging, its real and perceptual debilities? Can she navigate the shoals of self-doubt and loss, the betrayals of others and of her own body? Will she go down in the record books in a blaze of glory? Not without a fight.","popularity":0.887,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":67676,"logo_path":"/tjhWigdVfPxyIBmUadMWBUzFDtB.png","name":"Crazy Legs Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Places, Please","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
