Taking place across various landscapes and locations, the project builds upon a postcolonial perspective informed by technology, agency and the body, and narratives of migration.  Relic 0, which is the prelude to the series, is a short film that moves between African and Western based vistas and focuses on specific architectures of colonialism as delivered by an anonymous narrator. These discoveries deliver poetic moments of the sublime met with increasingly harrowing tales of trauma - speaking to the sinister way that states of anxiety, fear and displacement are both generated and policed in postcolonial society. The throb of the electronic score and ringing clarity of the narrator's testimony usher in a new landscape and temporality, born from cracks in a traumatised, apocalyptic present.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tujt3SEq6Q1XhcViGkB7oHv4Nge.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":150305,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hayward Gallery / Southbank Centre","origin_country":""},{"id":150306,"logo_path":null,"name":"Relic Traveller Larry Achiampong","origin_country":""},{"id":157390,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Jerwood Charitable Foundation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Relic 0","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
