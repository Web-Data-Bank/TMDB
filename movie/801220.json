Using the cut-up techniques of William S. Burroughs and Brion Gysin, I edited this film using experimental out-takes and guided purely by intuition. The film sat around for a year without a soundtrack. Then, due to a homophobic incident, I plotted my revenge, locked myself in a sound booth and let loose. A revenge film that will have you falling out of your seat.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9xxCgTjx5qcP0BnxwGDC2JOXwyo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Homophobia Is Known To Cause Nightmares","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
