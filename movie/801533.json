There she grows fonder of her new husband's half-brother, sparking a fatal love triangle between the three of them.  In a perfect synergy of the arts, choreographers Sidi Larbi Cherkaoui and Damien Jalet, together with the legendary performance artist Marina Abramovic, stage Pelléas et Mélisande as a cosmic dream. Like Debussy through his impressionistic music, the performers and creators of this production dispense with any illustration and instead bring out the hidden emotions of the characters.","popularity":0.612,"poster_path":"/uo4eUDTuFOjsW28MIWOOCUtanHB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-02-19","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pelléas et Mélisande - Genève","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
