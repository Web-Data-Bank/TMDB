They cannot be identified. Within them there is a struggle between the inner truth and the outside world. How did they become \"Anusim\"? Why are they and not others? The common line is a basic requirement in Orthodox society. You have to be 'someone' to take a step that takes you out of the line you were born into. Anusim are talented people, often with a rebellious personality. Years of research often make us indifferent to human encounters, not in this case.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sPS8dFqUBUZw0mkdZOuyuxzjliL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116016,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kan","origin_country":"IL"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Secret","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
