The makers of this 'absolute film' write in their introduction: 'This film only wants to be harmony; it is not a depiction of a certain subject.' The film shows abstract and figurative drawings that move and alternate. Balls, circles, lines, but also drawings of women, men and flats move across the screen. The only photographic images are those of card players. Prominent Filmliga member, filmmaker and FTL teacher Willem Bon was responsible for the colour technique.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tFlIyQ75Tq0EOVuKuIvcZA2KCxF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"1933-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Depth","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
