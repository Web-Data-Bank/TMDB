Thus begins his life as a quiet, straight-A student by day and a self-appointed hero at night. But what is a real hero? And who decides what is right or wrong? As the boundaries blur, Sean's dual life wears on his psyche and his two worlds careen dangerously close to colliding. Like a graphic novel you can't put down, Boy Wonder challenges morality, distorting perceptions of what is right and what is justified, as it races to its shocking conclusion.","popularity":6.988,"poster_path":"/kCbNgQDx4Y11N3M9b5aiEILbSZl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11048,"logo_path":null,"name":"Boy Wonder Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Beware the Hero","title":"Boy Wonder","video":false,"vote_average":6.465,"vote_count":115}
