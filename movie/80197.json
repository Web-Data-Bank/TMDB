Eusebio Luquin, a police inspector who never loses any sleep over his work, is asked to solve, along with his new detective, Fermín, the rape and murder of a young woman near the army barracks. The army, however, offers them little support in their investigations. Nevertheless, a recent photograph of the victim uncovers a vital clue, and the prime suspect turns out to be the husband of Elvira, a kitchen worker at the barracks. But just as it appears that everything has been resolved, a shocking series of events re-opens a case in which it seems some people are keen to keep quiet while the rest are keen that no questions are asked.","popularity":1.277,"poster_path":"/uXnqMcnXn2I5JHPf1x0PcWaBtR4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2004-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Muertos comunes","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":5}
