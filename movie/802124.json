He’s approaching the end of his career but he cannot accept his slow decline. He has just finished shooting his last movie and he’s deeply sad. The movie is inspired by the novel about Casanova written by Arthur Schnitzler, a character so similar to the director, even more than he could imagine. Schnitzler’s Casanova is aged, glory days are over: he lost his charm and his attraction to women, he’s broke and no more eager to travel through Europe. After a long exile, he just wants to go back to Venice, his homeland. While traveling home Casanova meets a girl, Marcolina. She reawakens his desire, lost for years. So, he tries to seduce her but that leads him to a tragic understanding: he’s an old man now. It’s not by chance that Leo Bernardi decided to tell this story right now, in a pivotal moment of his life and career. The destiny of both Casanova and his director leads them to a final confrontation.","popularity":1.721,"poster_path":"/c4Jo4vgLGK5pByuKHzAtVxmdvMT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18156,"logo_path":"/3nAuYcaWdpW0ULMvMz6V5HIJmCO.png","name":"Indiana Production","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":3366,"logo_path":null,"name":"Babe Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":120397,"logo_path":"/tj46yUkPI288kHiE9GK5HVjRoOL.png","name":"EDI Effetti Digitali Italiani","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":155990,"logo_path":"/py9VaywwK6KVi94YwrxSKVg1gkh.png","name":"RAI Cinema","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2023-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Casanova's Return","video":false,"vote_average":6.98,"vote_count":25}
