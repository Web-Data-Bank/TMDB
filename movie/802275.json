The film intends to portray an experiential landscape of love and loss. Starting in late 90s Beijing, a time when drastic social and economic transformation is taking place, the film attends to the inner world of a young man Mu Ke, and unravels with the dialogue of \"exchanging story\" between Mu Ke and his younger self. Narratives, memories, imaginations and disillusions flow out into an ocean of pure time.","popularity":0.608,"poster_path":"/5tKd80EKQC2xhI2D23dc2mFms6s.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2020-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bloom","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
