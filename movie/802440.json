The play begins with an argument over what to eat for breakfast, then turns into a generational clash over race, opportunity and a decision that Calvin made years ago. Donaldâ€™s grumpiness is peppered with disturbing outbursts, revealing bits of his past, informed by growing up Black and poor in the South.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/RS6rANVhMf2dkAOTNzi5SBzksX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Some Old Black Man","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
