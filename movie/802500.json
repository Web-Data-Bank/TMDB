He enjoys all this in his rich rural house, with his wife and two children, whom he very much likes, but which sometimes interrupt him to enjoy these pleasures. The disenchantment of the passionate routine always reminds him of the fabled memories of a moment in the past when, unexpectedly, he discovered in a handmaiden the surprising elevation of passion.  Until the harlot appears to her at the Estate, untouched by the past fifteen years, purer than before and, even in her eyes, rejuvenated. But married, to a dangerous man.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4cpgmrfxPDYKXJKTQPD0i3DA9y7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16606,"logo_path":null,"name":"Marginal Filmes","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2021-03-12","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An adaptation of the story with the same name by Portuguese writer Manuel Teixeira Gomes.","title":"O Sítio da Mulher Morta","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
