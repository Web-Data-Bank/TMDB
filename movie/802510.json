The film purely and sincerely captures the moments of birth. In the 1970s, it was rare for filmmakers to be able to film in a maternity hospital.

What's more, the shots taken with a hidden camera are genuine, warm and humanly honest.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lkzXQ72eL4QQxMZDVUfCrR2jl9y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6147,"logo_path":"/ygdtYCejdFLfMWht1M8XOwuM3Sj.png","name":"Tallinnfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1976-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Estonian","iso_639_1":"et","name":"Eesti"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Human is Born...","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
