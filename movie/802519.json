The filmmakers were able to have in-depth interviews with not only the writer's closest friends and relatives but also the notoriously camera-shy protagonist himself. The film vividly dramatizes many passages from his intensely autobiographical works of fiction. The result is an intimate and candid portrait of one of the most important and controversial Taiwanese writers.","popularity":1.113,"poster_path":"/wRYIblBXlLLaPPzRr6aZR61oLqy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":151571,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fisfisa Media Co.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2021-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Inspired Island: A Lean Soul","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
