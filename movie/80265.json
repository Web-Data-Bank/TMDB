Originally targeted at both rap and rock fans, the first \"Anger Management\" outing took place in 2000. It had two separate legs. The second tour took place in the summer of 2002. Eminem told LAUNCH, \"It's basically the same thing that it was the last Anger Management Tour without Limp Bizkit...Papa Roach are still cool though.\"[citation needed] The third tour took place in the summer of 2005. 50 Cent missed the tour's first two stops because of a scheduling conflict; he was tied up shooting his film debut. Ludacris filled in on those dates. The European part of the tour was cut short due to the exhaustion of tour founder Eminem and his addiction to sleeping pills.","popularity":2.727,"poster_path":"/tU8TsbF3Ca5I1dzAyzfUwGcWvCy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eminem - The Anger Management Tour","video":false,"vote_average":8.8,"vote_count":9}
