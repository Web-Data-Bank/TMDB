One evening he stares in the mirror and, after some hesitation, shaves, sacrificing a thick and characteristic beard goatee, typical of those years. Here begins, with a simple gesture that we could define as 'unconventional', the transformation of Fabrizio. Immediately a vital impulse emerges in Fabrizio that leads him to 'want more' from a life enclosed in watertight compartments and protocol rules. The viewer is an accomplice and faithful travel companion in his process of metamorphosis, who is not asked for a judgment or an opinion, but a simple understanding and vision of history, as it is, without prejudice.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/r3GdSt0e5DipyKbqJhIZT10HqGV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2020-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Il pennarello","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
