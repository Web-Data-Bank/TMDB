Shot with a wide angle (10mm) lens at a rate of one frame every twenty seconds \"AGW 2nd Floor South\" compressed an entire day into two minutes. The work confirms, yet again, both Vertov and Kracauer's conviction that film can reveal aspects of the world otherwise inaccessible to human vision.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yWPpmFQF0EebOjHP2lZJp1PCdUm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"AGW 2nd Floor South","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
