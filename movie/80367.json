Director Steve Metze examines several different groups including historical miniature gamers, role-players, and those known simply as \"LARPers.\" The film also explores opposition from religious groups, negative media portrayals, and some of the meanest 'man-on-the-street' interviews ever committed to video. Meet the Gamers, learn their exotic language, see their bizarre rituals, gasp at their semi-authentic costumes, and thrill to the painting techniques on their miniatures!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A film about gamers","title":"Über Goober","video":false,"vote_average":4.667,"vote_count":3}
