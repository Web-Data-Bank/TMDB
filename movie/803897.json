She sinks into prostitution to support herself and her daughter. She ends up marrying a Belgian man who is three times her age, hoping to find a better life in Europe for her and her daughter. Seven years later, the European dream has faded and her situation has only gotten worse.Delphine, like others, is part of this generation of young African women crushed by our patriarchal societies and left with this Western sexual colonization as the only means of survival. Through her courage and strength, Delphine exposes these patterns of domination that continue to lock up African women.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lTIMpNGDEiWQVsbRqetb2BPXset.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":114132,"logo_path":"/ibf60UBa4hqwaJn2VZSA9FLjGIw.png","name":"Tândor Productions","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"CM","name":"Cameroon"}],"release_date":"2021-06-23","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Delphine’s Prayers","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
