In Holwerd, a town that is known for the ferry terminal to Ameland, a bottom-up approach towards this problem is carried out right now, in order to find a solution for the population decline using the landscape, history, culture and ecological values of the area. In 2013 a group of people from the small town of Holwerd stood up to fight for the future of their hometown, and started a project. The project is called “Holwerd aan zee” (Holwerd at sea) and aims at bridging nature and culture by means of landscape art.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zeOcperZBfrVzeLlfcodPIvWaF1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107166,"logo_path":null,"name":"Moondocs","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Frisian","iso_639_1":"fy","name":""},{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Holwerd at Sea","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
