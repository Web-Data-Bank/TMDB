The petrochemical, city within a city. Children in poor neighborhoods, workers' voices: the crisis, the layoffs, the need for the recommendations of the Christian Democrats to enter Montecatini. Wealthy men and women binge at the restaurant. Voices of agrarians, forced to leave the earth to make room for the petrochemical. A ballroom. In a puppet theater, a show is staged in which the worker is addressed as \"starved\". At a course for foremost workers, various compliant testimonies follow one another: Monteshell is a large industry, and no one has any criticisms against it. But another worker, elsewhere, with his face in the shadows, confesses that everyone is afraid to speak, skilled workers get the same pay as simple ones, 400 colleagues have been fired, union activists are \"special supervised\", and going on strike is a business. 35mm b/w","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lhhjbylACHDMPG1Lb4ChGLKJSCz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1966-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The images of the faces of the workers, once young laborers in the fields, are placed in dialectical counterpoint with a puppet show that tells the same story of marginalization and social injustice.","title":"Brindisi '65","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
