The film tells the story of the author through his works: from the first to the last and incomplete ones. It is worth noting that close friends and co-authors of David, who have worked with him for many years, were invited to contribute to the film. The film used many materials: fragments of original cartoons, photographs, drawings, sketches, and newsreels of different years.
