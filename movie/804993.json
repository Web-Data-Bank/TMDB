Its narrative moves in paragraph blocks, with each sentence accompanied by different pictures of a young woman's hands, feet, torso, face… A TURNING POINT IN LUNATIC CHINA provides a critique of the methods of communication employed by my fellow Leftists. The ritualistic posturing and sloganeering I had used myself and seen in action in Chicago and San Francisco State, the seizing of exotic foreign figures (Mao, Che) and ideological rhetoric (SDS debates on Stalinism)–all struck me as mistaken and useless... [TURNING POINT] initiates a conscious probing of the means and techniques of mass communication, particularly film. 1, 2, 3, FOUR... delivers a critique from within of the... ideologies... of the 'counter-culture'... [It] provides no answers, but rather it allows the internal dynamics of the 'left' generate its own questions.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Primaries/ A Turning Point in Lunatic China/ 1,2,3, Four","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
