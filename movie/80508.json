Their debut Three Dollar Bill Y’All$ was moderately successful on release, but touring and single releases took it to the Top 30 of the charts. Their appearance at the Ozzfest tour was marked by the use of a giant toilet as set dressing. They emerged from the toilet announcing to the crowd that the music was straight from the sewer. That stunt, and their cover of George Michael’s “Faith”, which turned up on the film Very Bad Things, helped to build their profile.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Limp Bizkit - Greatest Videoz","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
