As the scope widens to the nets of longitude and latitude that encircle the globe, and of virtual networks like Grindr, Van de Port wonders aloud how connection, filtering and patterning play themselves out in his own life â€“ as a filmmaker, as an anthropologist, as a-gay-man-in-love.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/r8QYGEiPGEUbpMAL5tFlymINuNX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Knots and Holes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
