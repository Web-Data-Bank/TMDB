Spectators/participants/voyeurs were invited to write comments on the walls about images depicting a range of sexual practices between women. The soundtrack is equal part girls-making out and the voices of the women who produced and/or experienced the show. Chock full of comments on the most debated aspects of erotica and porn, Drawing the Line steps into the fray as a solid documentation of a pulse-taking art event.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xqDwzVDEIjZKyvEvC1ZWnDNU9TR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Drawing the Line","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
