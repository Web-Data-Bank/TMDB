However, the real purpose of her visit is to get back the 67,600 won, which the manager Jin Sang-i of the same team has not paid back for running errands for coffee and sandwiches. When she finally arrives at her office, she asks Hye-in Lee to return her money, but she only gets 50,000 won. The only thing she approached the frustrated Hye-in was the (but awkward) Deputy Oh, who was the only female employee on the same team.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":139110,"logo_path":"/jRiKTakOYY0OEeICDIHaIOSAZTx.png","name":"Rainydays Pictures","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2018-02-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Testimony","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
