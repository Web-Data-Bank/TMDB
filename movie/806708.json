Then we see that the subjects of the narrative are from dedications on memorial park benches that are very real; covered in moss and graffiti, heightening the confusion between what is real and what is not. Monument appears as a low budget doc about park benches but its narrative poses powerful questions about memory, memorial and the way of things...","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Monument","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
