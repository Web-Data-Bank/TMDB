At the battle, Napoleon (Fred Evans) and Wellington (Joe Evans) toss a coin for the first shot. The French, realising they have forgotten the ammunition, go off to the shops to buy some more. A troop of Boy Scouts charge Napoleon, who, after a chaotic battle, surrenders. He is taken prisoner and sent off in a boat, saying goodbye to France forever (here represented by a cardboard notice saying France on one bank of the Thames).  -Bryony Dixon- BFI","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1913-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pimple’s Battle of Waterloo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
