Since the late 80s, when the deepest dark matter research laboratory in the UK was built in the salt mine at Boulby, miners and research scientists have been working side by side in the underground network. In the darkness of this extreme environment, a young woman finds a new future. Scored with a soundtrack made entirely from underground recordings, this sensorial mosaic reveals a fragile equilibrium, a dimension in which utopian and dystopian futures coexist.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yGeJi7U2Ab1Dz13S2MurNOTgUPn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Under the North Sea","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
