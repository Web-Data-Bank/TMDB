Mikki is increasing her pain threshold so she'll feel more in control and won't feel compelled to scream. Doreen has no problem screaming but feels unheard. The static builds until relief is finally served on the tip of an exquisite bowie knife belonging to Tuna, who wants it back. Set against a backdrop of knife throwing and inflatable breast implants, Screamers is a film about screaming: wanting to scream, not wanting to scream, wanting to be heard - breaking the sound barrier.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sPtOEOhXIsFkbdXKiibMX4VptBU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Screamers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
