A sudden phone call changes the direction of his summer and brings Joonas to an old manor for a summer job, forcing him to open up to his new workmates and to face his shame. Joonas works hard under the burning sun, driven by his past mistakes, whilst the others lounge under the calming shade of trees. On the last day the group loses track of time and misses the last bus home. They are left at the old manor and a magical midsummer night begins.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6I1YmTubX62sIjc5hBSOvpNPO1v.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128546,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tampere University of Applied Sciences: School of Art \u0026 Media","origin_country":""},{"id":112481,"logo_path":"/iCSLFvjK6vxP2EUC7Y0paxXHar1.png","name":"ELO Film School Finland","origin_country":"FI"},{"id":151175,"logo_path":null,"name":"University of Tampere, Theatre Arts NÃ¤ty","origin_country":""},{"id":139903,"logo_path":"/mmrK6h7EvNhkCRLyiw3A5ROX36H.png","name":"Aalto University","origin_country":"FI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"2021-03-10","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Light up the past","title":"Guarding Fires","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
