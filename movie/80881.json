Leo Strakosch is among the exiled. He is engaged to Counsellor's Linder's daughter. He gets into the Republic, in a clandestine way, to show to the society the wrongness of their anti-semitic prejudice.  Bettauer's novel differs essentially from the film version. \"Vienna\" was named \"Utopia\". Even a happy ending was provided.","popularity":1.266,"poster_path":"/7iEb9qQuQuuoRh8Op3WroHMvuLl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":98469,"logo_path":null,"name":"H. K.
