Employees include Sybill and Windy, pale young women who toil endlessly at the pulp vats, and the more mature Helen, who is past breeding age. As Ari sits astride his beloved chimney, a Care-Giving Woman appears and offers a rooster to Taryn. The crows of this beast cause ecstatic, erotic disquietude in anyone within ear-shot. The cottage becomes a tropical whirlwind of desire until Helen manages to drown the rooster in the bubbling pulp.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cock Crew","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":1}
