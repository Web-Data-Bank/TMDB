With her mother still in New Orleans committed to the fight for Black land ownership and her father committed to starting a new life in the Midwest, divorce threatens to further separate a family already torn apart. Will Davis be left hanging in the balance? [hieroglyph] traverses the intersection of environmental racism, sexual violence, and displacement, examining the psychological effects of a state-sanctioned man-made disaster on the most vulnerable members of the Katrina diaspora.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hjzXbWv6HEc9pNjIZd6lWRS3WPJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":143811,"logo_path":null,"name":"San Francisco Playhouse","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"[hieroglyph]","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
