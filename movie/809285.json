Stephen and Anne, blissfully happy for eight years, are committed to living up to their ideals. When Stephen, a writer who isn’t writing, begins to sink into a funk of unproductive moodiness, Anne encourages him to seek out a fresh spark. Can their marriage survive uncompromising generosity, sacrifice and love? More than the story of an unconventional couple, the play is about what happens when our ideals clash with our emotions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/efvzFHTKq85qo1slEANcS9szYJi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":136974,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mint Theatre","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-03-22","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yours Unfaithfully","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
