From the story of Antônio Conselheiro, all theater relives its seminal death: a common man who, out of love, transmutes into an anti-messianic leader, gathering a legion of \"sertanejos,\" roots of solidarity in the inlands of Bahia who, in a community effort, raise dams, churchs, and cemiteries. The community had at one point 25 thousand inhabitants, in its days the second largest city of Bahia. Capuchin Friars attempted to disperse the people of Canudos \"diplomatically.\" Their denial to obey the official religious order led the Evangelist Friar to damn the followers of Antônio Conselheiro in the name of Jesus. The City prepares for war.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mEPuhvssKoHDJBioV9C55vlHAlG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":345,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Os Sertões: O Homem II — da Re-volta ao Trans-homem","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
