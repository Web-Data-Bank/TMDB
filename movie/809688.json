Elements of sand, dirt, light and shadow cross-reference the film's emulsion with evolutionary history and provide a second level of musical structuring through which the first layer is filtered. The animals' fur patterns, which evolved naturally as camouflage to hide them from predators, ironically now make the animals more visible to human predators who are attracted by their exotic uniqueness. This cinematic analogy underscores modern humanity's relationship to the natural world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wcLEwO8ECF3bHwLKN3rgGRq3xZW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1990-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Protective Coloration","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
