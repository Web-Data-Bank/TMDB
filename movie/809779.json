Janetta is a pillar of the trans community and head of the Trans, Gender-variant & Intersex Justice Project (TGIJP). Ronjah juggles multiple jobs as she dreams of moving out of her single room occupancy (SRO) and into an apartment near the ocean. Cookie searches for housing in a ballooning market that is unaffordable and leaves her homeless. These women take pride in living and working in this pre-Stonewall site of LBGT liberation, yet the spaces they hold dear erode as San Francisco’s housing crisis grows out of control.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pCudMhTTZeMbD1Qvtid6kLDNkT2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-02-28","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tender","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
