He is left feeling utterly broken and completely cut off from the rest of the world. Carla has left him a sad and angry man and as the days go by, his mind delves from one unsettling extreme to the other - maddening hope to vengeful anger.

Terribly stupid ... all to make her sorry.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tXiKuvFNrWr7YcfRm2FxBqOPrnA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Desperate men do desperate things","title":"Sad Little Boy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
