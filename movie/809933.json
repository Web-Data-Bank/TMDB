The townsfolk immediately know that \"they aren’t locals, they’re from the capital. You can tell by the way they dress.” The differences between the city and rural children are quite evident. While the country children nimbly climb trees, play games with knives and axes, and hide in their self-made tree house, the city children buy sweets in the town store, hoping to buy the goodwill of the local children. However, gaining entry into the tree house is not so simple.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/78O9RswsqXEYzUUtYYdwVXB2urb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112965,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anša Epnera studija AVE","origin_country":"LV"},{"id":118793,"logo_path":"/AckxUfY5wGZjKNnbiWDKubqxX8t.png","name":"Latvijas Televizija","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2013-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Treehouse Ipiķi","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
