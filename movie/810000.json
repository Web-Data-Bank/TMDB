Unheard of among eminent teachers today, such a practice is rife with hardships. For Mingyur Rinpoche, these challenges—begging, finding food and shelter, illness, and all the attendant risks of wandering incognito from place to place with the barest of possessions—present fertile ground for deepening insight into the true nature of the mind.  Wandering . . . But Not Lost is an intimate account of Mingyur Rinpoche's four-and-a-half-year retreat (June 2011 – November 2015) interspersed with Rinpoche’s own guidance in applying Buddhist wisdom to our daily modern lives that will touch—and inspire—audiences everywhere.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/Ak2UkRNjHKFh5uSkE54NSisCj9j.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wandering...But Not Lost","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
