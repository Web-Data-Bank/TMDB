The public and private lives of this \"strange animal\" are explored with the reverence and glee found in the educational expos√©s like Reefer Madness and bad-boy films like Rebel without a Cause. However, because this fictionalized lesbian history is a first-person narrative, it is filled with all the joy, pain, and ambivalence each of us experiences while negotiating a marginalized identity.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/d5HqVd86uNlPQRe1QWinATDJR80.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24726,"logo_path":null,"name":"Canada Council for the Arts","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":150959,"logo_path":null,"name":"Finger In the Dyke Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Day in the Life of a Bull-Dyke","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
