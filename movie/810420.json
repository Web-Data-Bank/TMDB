Wardell hand-developed this film in salt which resulted in a shimmering pock-marked effect on the celluloid which emphasises the film's own materiality and physical precarity in line with the earthbound fleshiness of the maker's voiceover narrative. However, the salt’s implications as a curing agent for meat and the way its visual impact brings together threads of preservation – of his father's life, of their mutual love, of the detachment they have felt for years – and the latent imagery of these things hanging and curing over time, becomes quietly overwhelming.\" - Ben Nicholson, Alt/Kino","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gcGODRlRqGcfXzWmgNvxGdM359Y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Psychic Meat","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
