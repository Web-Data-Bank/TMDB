Following the arrival of the railroads in the 1880s, tens of thousands of workers migrated there for jobs in logging, mining, and fishing - where they found poverty-level wages, crushing hours, and dreadful conditions. Conflict is examined in the context of a decades-long struggle, shining new light on tragedies like the Everett Massacre (1916), the Seattle General Strike (1919), and the Centralia Massacre (1919).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fQWHOKX4k3hf1HXNgA0NTQhMJZE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":187397,"logo_path":null,"name":"Looking Back Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Labor Wars of the Northwest","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
