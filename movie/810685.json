Our film will explore how one small mountain community has attempted to walk the line between development and conservation; growth and sustainability. This struggle, however, is not specific to Crested Butte, Colorado, it is a constant challenge for small towns across North America. In making this film, we are attempting to do our part, not only to conserve a piece of American history, but also to educate and inform future generations to come.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/m3ypvhnwr9d72wb5K8FJaBH99k7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"“It was as if someone had said to the kids of that generation, the 60’s, ‘Here’s a town, let’s see what you can do with it.’”","title":"High Country","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
