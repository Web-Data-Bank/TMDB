The story is interspersed with fragments of popular science films and letters from Yevgeni Zagdansky to his son in New York in the 1990s, creating a portrait of both the person himself and the whole era. My Father Evgeni is a film not just about the inevitable generational conflict and the pain of a father’s separation from his son, but also about the events of the 20th century, about people who read banned books, and about the Kyiv that shaped the Zagdanskys.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kEkN7hbl0k8Bh99VGWiQVdWZh6N.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2010-11-23","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Father Evgeni","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
