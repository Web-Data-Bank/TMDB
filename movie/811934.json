Nagle’s story illuminates the tragic consequences of commercial exploits, including the removal of Native people and the attempted eradication of their culture, that gave rise to the America we know today. Securities trader Jane Snake is torn between worlds. Her return to Wall Street in 2008 brings her to Manahatta (“island of many hills” in Lenape), the homeland her ancestors were violently forced to leave in the 1600s. Meanwhile, her family in Oklahoma struggles to save their language, their culture and their over-mortgaged home. Jane Snake’s return to Manahatta defiantly demonstrates that the Lenape are still here.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dwt5FOO3X2LYyo54iTMW2XAPCdv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":137558,"logo_path":null,"name":"Oregon Shakespeare Festival","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Manahatta","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
