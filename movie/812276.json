But beneath the surface they are inextricably linked to a multi-billion dollar industry which thrives on the commodification of the surfing lifestyle. With their populations swelling, resources draining, and housing prices going through the roof, where do these two towns go from here? Where does surfing go from here?  Under the Sun is a 16mm documentary shot in Byron Bay and the Gold Coast and features incredible surfing from Dave Rastovich, Beau Young, Nat Young and a handful of others as it explores the roots of commercialism that are now so entrenched in surf culture. Be prepared for a dark and compelling narrative amidst beautiful imagery and a kick ass custom soundtrack.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/a6sSoZbp1ZbhM5Qjrx0kVk2XmIH.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":151847,"logo_path":null,"name":"A Peel Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Under The Sun","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
