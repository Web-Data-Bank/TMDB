He employs a variety of techniques to transform himself. He cuts off parts of his body. He exercises. He wants to return to the water to speed up evolution a little. Has he gone mad, or is he just tired of being human? As the narrator descends into his private obsessions, we begin to perceive the distorted outlines of reason that guide his journey. The trajectory he takes allows us to reflect upon the correlations between the body and identity, our cultureâ€™s obsession with the body beautiful and what it means to be human.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ifVESpvAoD2MXl0PgVHXVBBUKxJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crush","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
