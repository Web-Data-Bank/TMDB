I captured close-ups of the dramatic reds, oranges, and greens of the foliage with their shadows moving in this environment of light wind. The original piece is presented as a two-projector performance, one showing negative film and the other a positive print of the same film. The two images are superimposed. Working with filters and hands as masks, I perform a color play between the two worlds of positive and negative color.\" â€“L.L.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/27NzOAeduUzwpZFlrTKmiqZMjcG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Autumn Fog","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
