In 2009 Pina returned to Chile for  her last residency before her passing that June. Eddie and I have continued our friendship ever since  bonded by our love for Pina. In 2016, we collaborated on a short dance film. I told Eddie how I wanted  to dance with the camera while he moved in the waters of Castle Island, MA. The film was shown as  a 16mm projected loop for an expanded cinema event at the Boston Waterworks Museum. After that  event I digitized the work print projected that night and created Temple Island, an ode to the body as  our motor and our temple.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Temple Island","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
