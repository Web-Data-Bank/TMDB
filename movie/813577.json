See this land of stark contrasts, from the squalor of an Untouchables’ encampment to the dazzling symmetry of the Taj Mahal. Go inside India’s Temple of Doom, and take a boat on the Ganges to the holiest city of Hinduism, where pilgrims in vain wash away their sins in its muddy waters. Travel to a secret baptismal service and gather with believers by lamplight as they rejoice over Jesus and the fellowship of His sufferings. Souls of the Brave is a story of extraordinary love and extraordinary sacrifice as believers take up their cross, follow Christ, and never look back.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pLq2AIdKeF5RKlK6e4RXPHShNMP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dispatches from the Front - India: Souls of the Brave","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
