The anticipation of love, the realization of beauty, a bright flash of feelings and experiences, the world of beauty and sounds, goodness and light caused in his soul a meeting with beauty in the image of a ballerina.  Love allowed the hero to rise above himself, above his deafness, above his dumb, gray world. Hence the associations: wings, flight, a new, bright, unreal world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/w1coxoMQdJo6zTxnzDELvchWSPJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wings","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
