The Tokyo Fire Department and its team of crack rescuers swing into action, and shortly after they do, a distress call arises from an underground subway station - with repeated indications of the rescue code, 252 252, and the exclamation \"We Have Survivors.\" It soon becomes apparent that the local rescue squad must attempt to save the survivors, doing so at the expense of their own lives and safety.
