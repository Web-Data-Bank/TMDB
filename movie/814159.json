She's ready and willing, and all it takes is a kiss followed by electrifying sex every chance they get! Games, games, games. In between sets you can find them in trailers, bathrooms, and bedrooms fucking their brains out. But playing favorites upsets the crew and they take off for an adventure off the set, where everyone gets off, all right. Games, games, games. All hell breaks loose when the director's wife (Melissa Hill) shows up and finds out about the affair. Meanwhile, the producer has no respect, the crew has no respect, and Melissa definitely has no respect. But she gets her revenge by fucking the leading man (Alex Sanders) and Jenteal! Steven finds the menage-a-trois taking place and becomes so mad that he goes after another actress, Selena. Games, games, games - very dangerous games!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hZ9G5WVsyLG75zEetHi8T3NefBk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5979,"logo_path":"/xjEVAzZSK95vbf3gRQ4APTPy2JX.png","name":"Vivid Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dangerous Games","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
