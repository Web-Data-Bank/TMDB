Driven by a vision of resistance, the encounters seek possibilities of renewal and question what connects us when the world seems to be falling apart. With mushrooms and their allies the film invites to imagine a myco-cultural (r)evolution. What if the fungus could help us address and radically change our relationship to this world?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/demHTrpcNFZXFjBS8FOsDbjJM3p.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85595,"logo_path":"/b7WeslTaEl82WgOywyfWMDwXkWX.png","name":"Intermezzo Films","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2021-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mushroom Speaks","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
