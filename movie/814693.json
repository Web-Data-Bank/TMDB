On a winter night, on a farm in the heart of Tuscany, a gander named Ottorino defended a chicken coop from a fox attack and lost his beak in the fight, risking certain death. Thanks to the inventiveness of a veterinarian, Otto survived. Instead of a beak, a copper prosthesis was implanted in its place. The gander was celebrated by all the animals in the farm as an example of strength and courage, with a new superhero name: Copperbeak. But what would happen if we interviewed the fox and the other animals to have their point of view? It would turn out that Otto is not really a hero after all. But there is always time to prove your courage and become one.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fvtZDhW4U5l6v5Xu4ZtD30OpJcK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8904,"logo_path":"/4IvWDPpPklykgC4CdlysDN3CEGv.png","name":"ideaCinema","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":137442,"logo_path":null,"name":"Movimenti Production","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"The true story of a hero... or maybe not.","title":"Copperbeak","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
