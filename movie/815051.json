Rivers converge in a rich, marshy wetland before draining into the Slave River. But the Delta is in trouble. Since the building of the WAC Bennett Dam in 1967, annual floodwaters--once the ecosystem's lifeblood--have become a thing of the past. The Delta is drying up, and lakes and wetlands are being replaced by brush. Species like the muskrat are disappearing. Footprints in the Delta explores the changes that have buffeted the region for several decades. Scientists, activists and Indigenous Peoples describe how lives have been fundamentally altered by the changes. And satellite images show the dramatic pace of degradation. Footprints in the Delta is essential viewing for anyone who cares about wetlands. It is a revealing account of the rapid change and environmental havoc humans can bring to a delicate ecosystem.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Footprints in the Delta","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
