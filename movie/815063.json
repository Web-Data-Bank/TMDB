His next big plan is to bring more romance into his parents’ relationship who seem to squabble non-stop. He finds out they were once happy, in a remote natural reserve, Bear Park. Surely returning there would fix their romance! That’s why Bertie urgently needs to win the inter-school skiing race with a prize trip to Bear Park. But Bertie has no talent for sports. Plus it's a relay competition for teams, and he is not very good at making friends either. Luckily Bertie bumps into Milly, an orphan – and a bear. Bertie helps Milly hide and finds out that she is superior in skiing. Could Milly take Bertie’s place in the competition?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":91222,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pyjama Pictures","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Bear Park","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
