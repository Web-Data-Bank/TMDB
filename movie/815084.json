But when humble map-maker, Dave, makes a shocking discovery, his attempt to raise the alarm is ignored. His curiosity stifled, Dave’s body rebels, and he sprouts a wild beard with a life of its own. With the unstoppable beard threatening to swamp the entire island, the residents mobilise in an effort to tame it. Chaos ensues, standards slip, but a new curiosity starts to take hold. As the blinkered corporation that runs the island desperately battles to regain control, Dave realises the beard is a force for good and works with it to open people’s minds and free Here from the tyranny of conformity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7xo1g2o911Dv6GPckEn0ECt3ZB0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":143396,"logo_path":null,"name":"Able \u0026 Baker","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":152244,"logo_path":null,"name":"Snafu Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"The Gigantic Beard That Was Evil","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
