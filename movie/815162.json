This event shocked me and forced me to examine my own brushes with suicidal intent. About a year after Thomas' death, my aunt was diagnosed with brain cancer. We were not very certain just how much time she would have left. This film shows myself and other people in close proximity to me quite nakedly, at a time where everything seemed weighed down by loss and uncertainty, managing somehow to reach out and accept life's light.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-02-19","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Water's Edge","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
