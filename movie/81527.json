Waste land on the city outskirts: behind a line of abandoned trailers, the man silently watches what seems to be a family. The same city, the same man: driving through traffic with two hand-made firing pins for a hunting rifle. The man is 42 years old, his name - Viorel. Troubled by obscure thoughts, he drives across the city to a destination known only to him.","popularity":1.795,"poster_path":"/A3Zw3thWLtDrXDKmD6bFHU1DupD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":35018,"logo_path":null,"name":"Romanian National Center for Cinematography","origin_country":""},{"id":6849,"logo_path":"/AjdOGHRLAhWbP1aAga85A9EOfD2.png","name":"SFP","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":7970,"logo_path":"/so1bsD7PbaSsFio7gVyW0M3qhsc.png","name":"Bord Cadre Films","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":13407,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mandragora","origin_country":"RO"},{"id":20691,"logo_path":"/zB4VpQ8BDxKKhUXam2u57ZZ9mtx.png","name":"Essential Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2011-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":181,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Aurora","video":false,"vote_average":5.907,"vote_count":27}
