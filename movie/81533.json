The journey took more then eight months. Sixty years later, a film crew retraces Levi's steps. Levi's words, mainly from \"The Truce\" (1963), tell us what he experienced. In turn, we see Poland's hollow post-war factories, nationalism in the Ukraine, Soviet-style Communism in Belarus, the abandoned town of Prypiat (Chernobyl), poverty and emigration from Moldavia, Italian factories in Romania, and on across Hungary and Slovakia to Munich where Levi's rage found no listeners. Then home to Turin. An aged Mario Rigoni Stern remembers his friend. What has changed? Some issues of the war remain unsettled.","popularity":1.335,"poster_path":"/2R5sPDFZh5YoHb6HEd3rHjd8EE3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":81033,"logo_path":null,"name":"Adriana Chiesa Enterprises","origin_country":""},{"id":30824,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rossofuoco","origin_country":""},{"id":155990,"logo_path":"/py9VaywwK6KVi94YwrxSKVg1gkh.png","name":"RAI Cinema","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2006-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Primo Levi's Journey","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":6}
