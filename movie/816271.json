And the title ‘audio activist’ is very fitting for the British composer Matthew Herbert. ‘A Symphony of Noise’ provides an insight into Herbert’s thoughts about how we should hear the world and presents amplified sounds of teeth being pulled out, a pig being born, and a swimmer crossing the English Channel. The controversial and political samples become a part of a live performance at the Berlin night club Berghain, which makes the listeners both grate their teeth and dance along. Matthew Herbert wants us to listen to the world afresh, and it is a pretty fantastic experience.","popularity":0.692,"poster_path":"/5Vj1ZAQBlN7i9q108IV5HzsklOQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2021-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Symphony of Noise","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
