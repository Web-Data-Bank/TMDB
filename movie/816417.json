Here is a film that shows us how to do it. A remake of Jørgen Leth’s film from 1967, which, with a gracefully choreographed body language, places itself between dance and performance - with social distancing and masks, of course. However, the perfectionism of the black-and-white aesthetics is just as uncompromising in Maia Sørensen and Kristina Daurova’s update, which with understated humour takes a look at what it takes to be a human being (perfect or not) during a pandemic, from private dinner parties to the public space.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/78CaYTIra3CYUrsFmfx7ePX5u5W.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How To Be a Perfect Human","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
