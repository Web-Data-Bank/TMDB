A man-made metal membrane that makes its own sounds and whose steel wires sing in the wind as it stretches across the landscape from the desert to the sea. In his meditative video and sound work, Kirkegaard has mounted microphones on and around the wall to understand its dual character as a militant monument and abstraction. Both panoramas and close-ups show us that this, at first sight, deserted area of south-western USA has its own life of light and shadow â€“ and not least sound.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sF59eww6z9ivSTvPdpr7Tn75BqT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Membran","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
