Each cell is a gallery, an indexical imprint of the anonymous inmates’ minds, from a past conjured forth by the film’s timeless black and white 16mm images, with a gloomy melancholy that borders on madness. But, at the same time, the surveillance machinery, the architecture and the many layers of engravings tell us about a society which, in its attempt to maintain law and order, creates monuments of its own shadow – set against John Cage’s ‘Perilous Night’.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iwB5o00KT6oXqzG3G85J8GmfD05.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-25","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shadow Codex","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
