Greenland's vast landscapes give the impression of being eternal, with man as a mere passing guest. But the changes are underway, and in his magnificent cinematic work, the visual artist Inuk Silis HÃ¸egh intervenes in the monumental nature of his country to let creation and doom be reflected in each other. Big words, but nothing less can do it in a work that unites film, installation, Land Art and sound art (with a sound page created in close collaboration with Jacob Kirkegaard) in a meditation on the elements and our own volatility. Is the Arctic wilderness only wild because man cannot control them? Or is it man himself who is out of control?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Green Land","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
