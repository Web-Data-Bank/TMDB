The innovative take on the classic story transforms renowned songs into spectacular, show-stopping numbers and creates a visual panorama that reaches beyond the stage and into the audience.  Drawing inspiration from the live-action film, the stage musical uses the scenic motif of a music box to guide you through the story. A transforming set takes you on a magical journey through the music box, from Belle’s provincial French town to the Beast’s mysterious castle. In fact, high-definition video projections immerse you in 23 different locations, which is quite a feat for a theatrical production.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/84uLXd4w2Js0lIOgrHw8Ogy9OS8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beauty and the Beast on the Disney Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
