And then travel up the coast to Tyre, where a modern-day Cornelius is proclaiming this same Gospel among the mosques and black flags of militant Islam. See the reach of God’s grace as Jesus does the unexpected and saves the unlikely.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xOBOyxPkgV8tRJh7Qde9wmrf5kG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Luke's Dispatches: Caesarea & Tyre - A Kingdom Without Borders","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
