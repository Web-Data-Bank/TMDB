The Athens of Paul’s day was a city full of idols and empty philosophies. In our day—beyond the postcard scenes of the ancient Acropolis—Athens is a city roiled with a flood of desperately needy refugees, street violence, and trafficking in human misery. Into this maw of need, God has sent His people to serve with compassion and to speak the Gospel with clarity and courage—whether in a mosque or a crack house. “Radical Rescue Work” opens a window into the lives of these faithful servants of the Risen Christ as they run to—not from—the cries in the darkness.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zPy8CvZl0OouXnh8VT9ruvnUUAQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Luke's Dispatches: Athens - Radical Rescue Work","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
