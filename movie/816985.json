The houses in it, almost to the roofs, are covered with sand, and the streets are somewhere deep under the sand dunes. From a distance, this village can be mistaken for an abandoned one. But people live there. The film tells the story of the dramatic transformation of Shoina-a thriving fishing village-into a dying village, almost completely buried in the sand.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/j8qDbjv5feqi3fpF529jgHbckZP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Between Sky and Sand","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
