Here on the banks of a dwindling river, lions and hippos fight for territory along this last source of life, a clash that grows more heated as the water level continues to drop. Enter a world where deadly force meets lethal power, where cubs and calves become collateral damage, and where a bull's fearsome leadership and a mother lion's devotion set the stage for a true-life drama.","popularity":0.655,"poster_path":"/aShPQHAZuR0u2LjzWfWeiAVZsXT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Turf War: Lions and Hippos","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
