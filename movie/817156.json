Fluid dynamics! In this DVD, the Imagineers demonstrate how they use fluids to their advantage in constructing rides and attractions like Grizzly River Run and The Seas with Nemo and Friends. Students will learn that a fluid is any substance that flows or moves easily due to its molecular make-up. They will also discover how fluid dynamics help us learn how fluids move and behave and how fluids can be used to create mechanical advantage.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1J57wt3r7b8rG8nPKjnqHM2P53Q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Science of Disney Imagineering: Fluids","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
