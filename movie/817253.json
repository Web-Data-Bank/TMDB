So, scientists have launched an experiment - a person has the opportunity to abandon the existence in the body, to become digital by translating into a hologram. It is impossible to return back to the body. A holographic person still has memory, consciousness, sight, hearing, and the ability to speak. Ordinary people see holograms without special devices and can come into contact with them... A new technology that changes the existence of man. Evolution or another form of escape? This is what some of those who have already become a hologram are trying to understand.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I am a Hologram","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
