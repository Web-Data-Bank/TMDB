It showcases the city in a raw, exposed and gritty fashion but still with a certain charm. Throughout their filmmaking process, they capture the peculiar events in the life of three strangers: the son (Fakhrul Aiman), the outsider (Eli Orkid) and the hustler (Nidusmas). They happen to express themselves in extreme ways at the sight of their own reflection in “the vantablack” -- they snap into a state of mind where they lose all their inhibitions and show their true self in a very physical way: through visceral, almost primal dance movements.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mDECsHbCtqL97epRpdCGjngbo58.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152489,"logo_path":null,"name":"KFSK","origin_country":""},{"id":152490,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vans (MY)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MY","name":"Malaysia"}],"release_date":"2021-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Lose yourself in the Vantablack.","title":"SILIKA","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
