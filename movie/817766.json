A landscape glides by behind a rainscattered train compartment window. In fact the journey goes nowhere, although a map suggests the contrary. As useless as the automatic panning controls camera in a large clothing store only reflects clothes horses. Also shots from a car on the highway, pictures of combat planes on a military airport or shots in the Amsterdam subway are not focused on telling a specific story. Sometimes they are transformed into abstractions, literally and emotionally. They are daydreams backed up by rhythm and sounds from Heyinkâ€™s synthesiser.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nnjfu2cfxly2h4wiGUYApD7vapl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Videoscreen 696 TV","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
