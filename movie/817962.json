Some call it a tribe mentality, others call it a shared sense of purpose. This film is our definition, written by a diverse team, each with their own ideas, their own forms of expression. \"The Collective\" is more than a sum of its parts. No matter who you are or where you come from - it feels good to be part of something special.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":7724,"logo_path":"/6QV240fIM04sZXpyLUoqhKGhf7r.png","name":"Red Bull Media House","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":98147,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Faction Collective","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2019-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Collective","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":2}
