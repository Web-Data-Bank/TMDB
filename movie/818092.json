This is David Gauzens' day to day. A Miami native, David knows glitz but he shuns it as part of a small, gritty band of kayak fishermen who forsake flashy boats for utilitarian pieces of plastic to pursue their passion. High seas, storms, even capsizing don't deter David from exhaustive encounters with prehistoric fish and he learns in the process how little he needs to be content.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vvOeE57nJXUW4ypjgI7bmnBRl1A.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"FLOTSAM","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
