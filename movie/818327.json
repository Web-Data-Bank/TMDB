The two directors have filmed Troels for 4 years, capturing all his ups and downs, the defining moments, both the hilarious and the sad. This material will be combined with Troels¿ video diary where we get even closer, and animation that will bring life to Troels¿ text and inner universe in a compelling and humoristic way. The animation is done by the artist Carl Krull whoose very distinctive style matches Troels¿ story and personality, combining darkness and humor, the grotesque and the beautiful. It will be subtly integrated into the filmed material, at times taking over completely. The story of Troels and the visual approach melt together.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tEEQlpOIo6VclLo4vFQhsypnSeC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29062,"logo_path":"/hwlA6f2HhaOJP1ZcrYL8f8g8UbJ.png","name":"Final Cut for Real","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":25220,"logo_path":null,"name":"New Danish Screen","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2012-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Travelling with Mr. T","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
