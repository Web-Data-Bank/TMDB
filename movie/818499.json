From the poles of the planet to the belly of the equator, this documentary sheds new light on four giant animals that are still a great mystery to science today: the Titanoboa snake, the Megalodon shark, the giant rhinoceros and the giant sloth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bgLBt8cAej4SiumCbpOSH72ZnXR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90594,"logo_path":"/4Z4FdPkPcuAn4CU9jC0LuJJAMwR.png","name":"French Connection Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":152653,"logo_path":null,"name":"Berenice Medias Corp.","origin_country":""},{"id":13542,"logo_path":"/sJ0R9LDMGR5ildYS4GMhQcbKJVD.png","name":"CNRS Images","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mysteries of the Giants","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
