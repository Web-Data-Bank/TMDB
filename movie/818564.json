This is the story of what happened on that most celebrated and important day, including original interviews with historians and veterans who tell their stories and share their first-hand experiences.  Using unseen archive footage and stills, plus never told accounts from veterans who were there, this one-off special will chart the moment the clock struck midnight, to 24 hours later, when fighting officially stopped across Europe. Up and down the country it was dawning on people that they were waking up not with fear or anxiety, but with relief and excitement. This was a Great Britain no one had experienced for six years. A Britain at peace. At almost no notice street celebrations were being prepared and tens of thousands were flocking to London and other city centres.","popularity":1.001,"poster_path":"/ecMwSlcSepJAhmFvrVal0b1F833.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13007,"logo_path":null,"name":"Discovery UK","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2020-05-08","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Tony Robinson's VE Day Minute by Minute","title":"Tony Robinson's VE Day Minute by Minute","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2}
