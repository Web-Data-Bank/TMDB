Or rather he ran into us, coming off the ferry late in the day. The mist was thick and we looked worn-out. He took us under his wing and offered to show us around the island the following day. There is a long sequence shot of the passing scenery, taken from inside his car. Driving along the only road, Jovan pointed out to Vincent the island’s disarray: abandoned cars and tractors, heaps of rusting scrap metal. Then  on another island, Papa Stour, with a view of Foula, we filmed what was to become the first part of the film.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Détour, suivi de Jovan From Foula","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
