She then introduced me to Colette’s Les Vrilles de la vigne [The Tendrils of the Vine], a text that she had read at a friend’s funeral. The idea for this very simple film came to me with Françoise’s voice: ‘As long as the vine grows, grows…’, to the song of the nightingales, as night was falling, at Vincent’s place. We did three takes, three readings one after the other, so that the last would finish deep in the night. I kept an excerpt from the second take and the end of the third, in the darkness. This film was the trigger for Maniquerville.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les Vrilles de la vigne","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
