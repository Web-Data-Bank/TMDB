There, he made a film which he has just completed, twelve years after an unsuccessful attempt. One of the first shots shows the cabin from a steep high-angle view as if seen from the top of one of the trees bordering the glade. More than Thoreau’s cabin, this shot brings to mind Edison’s Black Maria studio. Like the house in Vattetot, the wood cabin is a film studio. And a haunted house.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Cabane de Dieu","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1}
