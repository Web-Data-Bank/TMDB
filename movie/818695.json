Rencontre avec Georges-Arthur Goldschmidt","overview":"“When FACIM (Foundation for international cultural activities in mountain regions) called me to propose making a film about Georges-Arthur Goldschmidt, I didn’t know him as a writer, only a little as a translator. So I immediately read his books, Le Recours and Le Poing dans la bouche, published by Verdier, which moved me deeply….I didn’t write a script. The commission was to film Georges-Arthur Goldschmidt in the places he arrived at in France during the war, in Megève, and his relationship to the region, which is very present in his books. I filmed him from day to day over four days. On returning to the places of his childhood exile, he met the families who had helped him survive, people his own age who were children at the time, whose memories were reconstituted together.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le paysage pour témoin.
