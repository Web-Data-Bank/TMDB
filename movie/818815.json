What followed was a rivalry that would reap Grand Prix victories, international domination that was a propaganda coup, and provide world fame to its drivers who risked their lives smashing speed records that would stand for 79 years. All under the direct orders of the Fuhrer himself.  This special one-off documentary charts the rise of Nazi Germany’s dominate ‘Silver Arrow’ Grand Prix and Speed Record cars of the 1930’s.
