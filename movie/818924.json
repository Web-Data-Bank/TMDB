In DECAMERON, Rita Hui Nga Shu combines this speech and other historical sources with fiction and contemporary images. Her gripping documentary takes a critical look, for example, at the question of what Hong Kong actually is at this particular moment in time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/AnleZ1lmfKyxVCkjpa63ZOQ6L0b.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152707,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rabbit Travelogue","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2021-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Decameron","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
