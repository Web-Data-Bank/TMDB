We the Power follows friends, families and visionaries, as they break down legislative barriers, take power back from big energy companies, put it in the hands of locals, and share the benefits to strengthen their towns. The film chronicles four local cooperatives from deep in the Black Forest, to the streets of ancient Girona, to the urban rooftops of London, as they pave the way for a clean energy revolution and build healthier, financially-strong communities.","popularity":0.612,"poster_path":"/zuCGnjBNO60ASctodOZy0xlpfsY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152737,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vacationland Studio","origin_country":""},{"id":150404,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bureau Voorlichting","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-02-20","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The future of energy is community-owned","title":"We the Power","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
