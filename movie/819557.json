But it’s a dangerous thing to be led around by Cal, an irresponsible, frustratingly likable kid brother, enthusiastic to the point of irrationality to find Bigfoot for himself. For Cal, this is not a matter of legend. This is not just some adventure. If Samantha doesn’t stop him, Cal will either find Bigfoot or die trying.","popularity":1.04,"poster_path":"/2p58pg4xgIzg4wp6ftw5NtSUym2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":130834,"logo_path":null,"name":"MindInMotion","origin_country":""},{"id":65465,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cyfuno Ventures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Cryptozoological Dramedy","title":"Ape Canyon","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
