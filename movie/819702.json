Hidden Eden is a metaphor for our inner secret garden of creativity. This project bloomed during an art residency in Iceland, sparked by conversations around our shared philosophies on voice and emotional connection. The nature of Iceland inspired us to make the connection on how the landscape reflects the emotional states of creativity and how it helps manage the homeostasis of our inner emotional landscapes. This exchange between emotion and the landscape opens a space for healing. Creativity provides us with the tools to access a garden of our authentic being, nourishing and balancing us. Allowing ourselves to explore the spectrum of our emotions through the lens of our relationship with the Earth invites others to do the same. The creative process can affect our well being and is a key to human evolution.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/olPlJN91fbdJ6YRny1CAP36RioE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152834,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sacred Sea Records","origin_country":""},{"id":152835,"logo_path":null,"name":"Never Content","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Ecology of Emotions","title":"Hidden Eden","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
