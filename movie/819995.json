Playing To Win is about guys on the rise--a upwardly mobile crowd who seem to be up, up, up all of the time. Our tale follows the adventures of two good buddies--Steve Sax (more about this later), a very rising young entrepreneur who has almost everything--money, looks, a body to die for and a cock that could kill, and Pagan Prince (a STUDIO 2000 exclusive whose wonderful cock knows no limits except hard, harder and hardest), a television sports reporter who personifies the idea of minimum effort for maximum effect.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zTEZWWekPlpL2mHrNMxtJOrG8Nx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111582,"logo_path":"/lv7W9er923HNeSbVYwQBYtHjd6i.png","name":"Studio 2000","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1996-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Playing To Win","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
