Funny how a 30-year-marriage can sound so different when described by separate parties in separate interviews. Wang captures her parents’ broken marriage with a carefree, humorous yet somehow also critical perspective, lacing her film with pop music from their generation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4GS9UQroqoyyTcfaRD2qBtAwJwV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"More Than One Is Unhappy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
