In a lavishly decorated nightclub, couples dance the syncopated rhythms of Latin America: Rumba, Cucaracha, Tango, and also the Charleston, Foxtrot and Boston. Among beautiful women, local pimps and Mussolini's spies brush each other on the dance floor, and in the streets. A police inspector is charged with a difficult task, to clean-up the city streets - just when bodies start falling around, as the Mafia and the spies tend each other deadly traps.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/2tEuNeYIXhWz1CIU8CES6QddOYP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":582,"logo_path":"/bEORFnCh6xQ3oQuY6yX6mRRCLvW.png","name":"Hachette Première","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":65538,"logo_path":null,"name":"Progéfi","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":356,"logo_path":"/tSJvuFaLIp7l0ONLUiAHA61GbXu.png","name":"TF1 Films Production","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1987-02-18","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Rumba","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":1}
