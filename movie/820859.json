He is shy and awkward, he is someone who lives life with his head down, never with his head held high, a man of the aquarium, as an ampoule, certainly not a \"sea fish\". The last day of the bull is a comedy about the evil of living.","popularity":2.838,"poster_path":"/wE8joMxsIUeUnv5aCNb7ko1zD5I.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-07-20","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'ultimo giorno del toro","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":5}
