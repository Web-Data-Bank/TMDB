For ten years, he produced at a sustained pace a very significant series of films: Jacques Rivette's Out 1, Marguerite Duras' India Song, Robert Bresson's The Devil Probably, Benoît Jacquot's Closet Children… The freedom of these works entails a relationship with their production circumstances, the quality of the encounters that favored them, the spirit of a time. This film is the portrait of an era as much as of a producer, investigative film or a journey into the past of French author's cinema.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Un étrange équipage","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
