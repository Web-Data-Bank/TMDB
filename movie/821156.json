His presence is still a source of heart ache to his mother, and other family members don’t seem to be happy to see him back. As gangsters gather around the funeral, Ho-sung starts an ad hoc gambling den with the funeral donation to make more money to prove that he’s still alive and to be the father by supporting his children. But his method backfires and ends up biting his butt instead.","popularity":1.631,"poster_path":"/2420Z0MSFpIg7LEtFPvEzUAvho9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15974,"logo_path":null,"name":"MCMC","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":73918,"logo_path":"/lnHDA1Fnpdjbg6fUF4gpneeAdf1.png","name":"Contents Panda","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2022-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When Spring Comes","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3}
