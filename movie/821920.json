While escaping, she picks up a magic cup. With the help of the powerful genie in the cup, Bobo embarks on a fantastic adventure featuring giants, magic and treasures. The composited special effects in the film are fascinating: the horizontal ancient well, the giant hand controlled by electricity, the grand palace and the incredible mountain ranges embellish an Aladdin-like story. After its first run in cinemas, this film enjoyed popular second runs, matinees and numerous screenings on television, entertaining many generations of Hongkongers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":96685,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tao Yuen Motion Picture Development Company","origin_country":""},{"id":91001,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wader Motion Picture \u0026 Development Co.
