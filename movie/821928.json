Sun Ma Si-tsang, at once a master Cantonese opera actor and a talented comedian, showcases an oft-overlooked style of singing, presenting it as an inspirational force that saves life and betters relationships. He plays the titled character, who doesn't operate a boat and is nowhere near bodies of water, but an artist specialising in the Dragon Boat style of music. Forced to perform on the streets to make a living, he ventures into situations manifesting the many societal problems that plague Hong Kong, inspiring and elevating common folks with his artistry. He stars alongside Leung Sing-por in a classic animation of comedy partnership, generating laughter from the interactions between players of contrasting body types.","popularity":0.877,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":153117,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wanli Film Studio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1952-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cheung, the Dragon Boatman","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
