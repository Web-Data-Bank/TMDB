These two disparate new realities have disrupted customs and traditions and are now bearing witness to different drifts, some with times that anesthetize and others that excite and exhilarate, yet without knowing where they are heading. The place portrayed in Derivas (Drifts), associated with the frontier of the sea and fishing boats, begins to be occupied by nomadic flows of people whose interests are very different to the origin of this place, completely redrawing and resituating new events.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mrbMNNjZfT9JPKMnk0BnZ1OVYd2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":153660,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rinoceronte Films S.L.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2020-11-13","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Drifts","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
