By focusing on the construction and performance of masculinity in yeosung gukgeuk, siren excavates histories of non-normative gender identities, intimacies, and sexualities in Korea.  Deferral Theatre engages in the works and life stories of three contemporary artists: Nam Eun-jin (a male-role yeosung gukgeuk actor), Minhee Park (a traditional gagok performer) and drag king Azangman, provoking questions around the patriarchal invention of a “tradition” and gender norms.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iWgrzOpHZX7GTgtnAuiGl9VWIxH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2018-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deferral Theatre","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
