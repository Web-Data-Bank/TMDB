The initial idea quickly evolved into a full film exploring the formation of an idea from the hidden depths of the mind, spiralling and rising through different stages of consciousness, until finally crystallising as a fully-formed idea.  The film’s title, Idein, is the ancient Greek word meaning ‘to see’.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dOsjkKEu1hFzVfe57LAleriz042.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"animation, short film","title":"Idein","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
