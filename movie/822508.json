This regime is called Fujimori. It is time to remember what that dictatorship was like, which has been washing its face for a quarter of a century. It is time to remember that Keiko Fujimori was not outside the dictatorship but participated in it. He fed on her.  Because Keiko Fujimori is the most ambitious and wicked version of her father. We have to ask ourselves if we will be up to the task so that we are not the sad and submissive version of Peru in the early nineties.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7XjObcYCE6CO1N6vlzTjqRQDKOA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PE","name":"Peru"}],"release_date":"2016-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Su nombre es Fujimori","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
