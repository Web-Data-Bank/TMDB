A unique adventure through the most remote areas of the Rocky Mountains, between pristine nature and wild animals. An epic journey that led them to travel 4,000 km and climb 60,000 meters and that, day after day, forced them to face their own limits, their strength and fragilities, and tested their relationship. Because every journey is always a love story.","popularity":0.653,"poster_path":"/jZ6p28kvZXBbGMmPVg9Kria7hIP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":152664,"logo_path":null,"name":"Samarcanda Film","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2020-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grizzly Tour","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
