YELLO uses only fresh ingredients\".\r In response, YELLO made a promise on stage that if they ever performed live in Switzerland, their first time would be at Nobs's festival in Montreux. Twenty years later, on July 12, 2017, YELLO kept their promise and performed at Montreux. Claude’s successor, Mathieu Jaton, announced the band simply thus: \"Ils sont là. Ce soir. A Montreux. Pour vous!\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uyZ5LnlFGqr5VxkK6KA9sjW5wQ6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-08-20","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Yello - Live At Montreux Jazz Festival 2017","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":2}
