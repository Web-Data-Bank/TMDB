The film exposes the lies behind the notion that solar, wind, hydro, biomass, or green consumerism will save the planet. Tackling the most pressing issues of our time will require us to look beyond the mainstream technological solutions and ask deeper questions about what needs to change.","popularity":0.829,"poster_path":"/ejnIMnaPc5mIfcPTlrS97NfnyRo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Clean Energy Has a Dirty Secret","title":"Bright Green Lies","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":5}
