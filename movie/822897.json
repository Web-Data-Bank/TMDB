We see Kenneth Fletcher draw several millilitres of blood from his arm and inject the contents of the syringe into Paul Wong's back, just under the skin. The camera closes in on this, observing the slow response of the immune system as the skin turns red and purple. What was originally intended as a sort of ritual uniting the young men as blood brothers, with implicit reference to drug use, has become a disturbing and dangerous act, when AIDS evokes our deepest fears and anxieties.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kdPPJunUail2TtEl3xjWMOb8709.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"60 Unit; Bruise","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
