Sometimes these dreams are not very well taken care of and those futures get lost in the layers of history that make up the blunt materiality of everyday city-life. This film attempts to track down and interrogate those dreams, find the remnants of utopia, trace the outlines of the future, cut through the layers, and perhaps learn a little more about the nightmares that crept into the plans along the way.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bFcUmkRXNQFrZqpVsNt6nhuscln.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Coventry Radiant City","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
