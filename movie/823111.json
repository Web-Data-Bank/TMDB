The first element is the film footage that was found by the artists at the U.S. National Film Archive. These staged films, produced by the War Relocation Authority (WRA), captured a fictional idealized life of Japanese Americans in the American concentration camps during World War II.  More than a hundred thousand innocent civilians of Japanese descent were incarcerated solely based on their ancestry. To legitimize the abrogation of civil rights, the WRA produced this wartime propaganda. The second element is the slide show in which the still images reframe the raw material of the WRA films.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sb6AhBxwBcKbGhD0SF9gGckrvxp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Framed","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
