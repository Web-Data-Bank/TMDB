According to the Cuban government, racism does not exist because there are no races. Everyone is Cuban. Thus talking about race in Cuba is a complex subject. Afro Cuba Libre aims to uncover just one layer of a multi-tiered conversation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/27nfLmDHWfsNSGAbdsii1vx5WIy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CU","name":"Cuba"}],"release_date":"2016-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Afro Cuba Libre","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
