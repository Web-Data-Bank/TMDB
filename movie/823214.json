Everything was for sale, one way or another... high pressure selling, lending. I figured ‘Good grief, this is all water off a duck's back.’ I used a lot of advertisements cut out of newspapers, and juxtaposed ‘important’ images (the Queen, Jesus, warships) and hectic activity with ducks, swimming around serenely in their ponds... things overwhelmingly important to some, totally unimportant to others. Ducks carry a lot of associations in the English language... ‘ducking for cover’, ‘sitting duck’ and so on.” (Paul Winkler)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wLQTz4uXeeTkVhK5TOjVFbV9Ntl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Incongruous","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
