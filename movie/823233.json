With a 200mm lens I shot stills of people at traffic lights and pedestrian crossings. The look was flat and harsh. Again I used the matte-box image shifter, to create motion where there was no motion…to create a tension. I wanted to show the frustration you sometimes feel when the damn light doesn’t change. You stand there…in your mind you’re already moving…but you can’t move.” (Paul Winkler)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2fuZAaAfr0ClE0cavJqft08xBlO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Facades","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
