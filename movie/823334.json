One is non-binary, gender fluid, genderqueer, trans or cross gender, bisexual or pansexual. There is also strong opposition to this. The Catholic Church sees the \"gender ideology\" as a \"postmodern aberration\", and all over Europe thousands of people take to the streets to fight the supposed \"gender madness\" and to promote the heterosexual nuclear family as the basis of a healthy society. What is it up to the strict distinction between man and woman? Do we no longer need our classic gender roles? Is this so-called binary concept still tenable? This documentary examines these questions from a scientific perspective and shows that the world is definitely more colorful than we long believed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vzLqQyO8yMgEoApsCkIKYD4xI1a.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":588,"logo_path":"/6mWg9rdVSj8gwgMiOmZH4iBCcMm.png","name":"MDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2021-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sex und Identität","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
