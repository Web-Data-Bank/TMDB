However, pressures from a world on the cusp of change expose an ache for what they could never have in a wistful and whimsical serenade with tunes reminiscent of the Great American Songbook.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wnl9AayI19yVBGXruIEokKbhbXk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":148545,"logo_path":null,"name":"Signature Theatre","origin_country":""},{"id":150789,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chiet Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-04-27","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Midnight at the Never Get","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
