In 1974, 30 of those experiments were mounted in sequence - so more or less chronologically - forming a film entitled Elementary Filmhistory. This film was intended to make a broad reading of the direction in which the cinema grew from 1960.\" (Klaus Wyborny)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7P86iJ3Bv6jGWz7YY1k2wfwGoHE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Elementary Filmhistory","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
