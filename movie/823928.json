The second of seven smart-looking animated shorts in the \"fun and facts about American business\" series. Its subject is \"the profit motive,\" and it stars \"Freddie Fudsie,\" a lazy soap maker who just wants to go fishing. He invents bar soap, makes some money, and is about to retire in peace and quiet when a sexy lady (the Profit Motive) walks by and Freddie -- who suddenly needs more money to win her affection -- never sees a fishing hole again. But that's okay, because \"the profit motive has been the driving force behind the growth of American industry\" and \"will make a better life for the children of tomorrow.\" Oh, really? Watch for the cameo by \"Joe,\" who later starred in Why Play Leap Frog? and Meet King Joe. The films in this series were made possible by a $597,870 grant from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tOevMZdTGkEltmbiMDPMCdOord6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1948-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Going Places","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
