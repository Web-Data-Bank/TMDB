But because they belong to warring families, Romeo and Juliet's love may be immortal, but it is above all forbidden.  The chamber opera by the German-Baltic composer Boris Blacher, written in 1943, condenses Shakespeare’s famous tragedy to its essence: the fate of Romeo and Juliet. Scenic miniatures conjure a foggy world hostile to love. Characters occasionally materialise like ghostly apparitions, while a Brechtian chansonnier comments with humour and with harshness on the failure of the greatest love story of all.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2oJOjI0hSkOHSKhGaRB8k9BYIRm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Romeo und Julia - DOR","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
