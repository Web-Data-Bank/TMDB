Now fences have gone up all over Europe, seeking asylum has become almost impossible. The teenagers cross snowy landscapes and meet aggressive border police on their way. Reaching their final destination has become more difficult than ever. Their journey takes them through the whole of Europe: from Greece to North Macedonia, Serbia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, from Italy to France and The Netherlands. The film was shot over a period of three years, partly by the main characters themselves on their phones.","popularity":1.709,"poster_path":"/t9MpZRJ5wNG1dr2fokwS1FBi6rb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110334,"logo_path":null,"name":"Witfilm","origin_country":"NL"},{"id":104383,"logo_path":null,"name":"PROSPEKTOR","origin_country":""},{"id":99613,"logo_path":"/u9a9AizRCLzcDMKqJnAy0uYtCJT.png","name":"KRO-NCRV","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2021-05-27","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Kurdish","iso_639_1":"ku","name":""},{"english_name":"Pushto","iso_639_1":"ps","name":"پښتو"},{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Journey trough the dark side of Europe","title":"Shadow Game","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":6}
