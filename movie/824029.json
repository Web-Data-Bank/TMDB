But where does Mélisande come from? And what do we really know about the two heroes' silent love?  A single opera was all it took for Debussy to transform the history of music forever. Opéra de Lille presents us with a Mélisande full of vitality and determination, far from the familiar ethereal figure. In the pit, François-Xavier Roth and his internationally renowned ensemble Les Siècles, playing on period instruments, lend new colours to a score which we thought we knew.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A38Fi3T4h5VACIcpFjVq5yg9zow.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pelléas et Mélisande - Opéra de Lille","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
