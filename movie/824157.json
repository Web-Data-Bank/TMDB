The film uses physics, which explains how the universe works, to explain our metaphysics – the story of our values, our institutions, our interactions. Using her own experience and a custom blend of insight and humor, provocation and inspiration, personal story and social commentary, Emily takes her audience through its own paradigm shift: from the Fear of Change to the Edge of Chaos.","popularity":0.629,"poster_path":"/9jq9ByNjkbGYEzzy49rktfcjXUW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Emily @ the Edge of Chaos","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
