Using an eclectic mix of performance footage, still photography, and interviews with members of the Alberta Beef Drag King Troupe, the film draws audiences into the sexy, rebellious, and sometimes humorous world of drag kinging. And the Rest is Drag questions how different experiences of race, class, size, sexuality and ability inform our many-gendered identities, and invites viewers to do the same.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pnsqCumcX9ZazzdUi5yUFXr1E6P.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":153612,"logo_path":null,"name":"KingCrip Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2009-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"And the Rest is Drag","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
