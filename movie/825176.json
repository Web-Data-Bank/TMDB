Avoid the circular logic of thinking about hunting in a roundabout way. Hunting must be stopped now, discursive roundabouts about the possibility of regulating it are circumlocutory escape routes! In this video, you hear ouzels singing in a cellar, deprived of sunlight, exploited and commodified, sold as call birds. Ouzels are highly sought for their wondrous vocalization. In turn, as in a death carousel, they are then used for attracting other birds that will be killed by legalized exterminators, otherwise called hunters.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iZPMBsoEF8e7w9FU1uPh00hxdd2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116408,"logo_path":null,"name":"Artoldo Pictures","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2018-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"CarOuzel","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
