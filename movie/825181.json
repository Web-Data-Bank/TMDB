Every single sand corn symbolizes a data-set of a memory captured in the world wide web saved deep down in the ocean. From there the bytes condense and finally reach the cloud. But how would it feel for a machine to see the glitch waves and feeling the shore stones on its case? What would be the colours of the coastline? Glitching Offshore tries to portrait the soul of an AI and the universe behind it. Glitching offshore, alike drifting away as in a psychogeographical d√©rive (furthermore, away from the \"rive\": bank) where human intentional yet chaotic action is substituted by pixels' stirrings of the soul.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hrgoaYl5KDvtOTak1RmcykVe6g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":116408,"logo_path":null,"name":"Artoldo Pictures","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2021-01-15","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Glitching Offshore","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
