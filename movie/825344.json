Lovecraft’s most gripping horror tales. The film presents the story of a middle aged man who wakes up one night to horrific sounds coming from the walls of his own apartment. He believes the screeches to be the sound of rats but no one else will confirm his suspicion. In his search and difficulties in locating the source of these sounds, the protagonist is rattled by whether what is happening exists in his mind or in reality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jaPk9R3pajceCWeFfieqTviupxh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2021-05-08","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rats in the Walls","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
