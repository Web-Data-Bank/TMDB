When it is finished, before inhabiting it, they invite a group of people to visit it. The invited people circulate individually through this new and empty space. They look, they walk, they talk. The film tries to rescue the effect of that experience in each one of them. So the space itself becomes an experience. What will they leave of themselves? What will they take? What will they show of the human? What is a house? What do you do with the past? The series of people who briefly inhabit that place, recently built, still free of all traces, could be thought of as infinite. The space fills and empties. The residual of that transit remains: a luminous fragility.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u75GxPPMY0etSkLMbeRsDpmSLQK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":67494,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tercera Orilla Cine","origin_country":""},{"id":67493,"logo_path":null,"name":"Insomnia Films","origin_country":"AR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2021-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El piso del viento","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
