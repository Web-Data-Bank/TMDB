The moving goodbyes penned by a few of those sentenced to death are sometimes true spiritual testaments that explore the meaning of civic responsibility, human existence, fraternity, and life and death. Their words, which the film mingles with footage of the present day, can perhaps restore meaning to a humanist ideal and to the ever-changing idea of a united Europe.","popularity":1.394,"poster_path":"/yvLdMK8U9bgWrrkCbM0oscsYX4Z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":153701,"logo_path":null,"name":"Altara Films","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":14016,"logo_path":"/snclwsIZQbgvqYCBJP8fqNlCA5y.png","name":"MiC","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":48686,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bocalupo Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2021-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Letters from Europe","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
