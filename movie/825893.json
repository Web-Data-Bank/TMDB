Since everyone has his or her own experience and values, I call the world of Chain Reaction “a view of schizophrenia”. Most of the images of the video surpass, as well as imitate daily life experience absurdly. The film is to analyze and oppose evil by the way of using the power of evil inside human nature. Chain Reaction is an allegory of evil but without the function of salvation like the other allegories.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aupqsMWA4s0XlALuFYayHvaKejL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chain Reaction","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
