Using as a starting point her participation in Teatro Oficina's 1967 production of the play \"King of The Candle\", by Oswald de Andrade, Inês creates a manifesto in defense of art's political strength, intertwined with memories of lost love and resistance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/g5hzlSL4ONyFCGCDLGBiSZsO5us.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2020-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inês","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
