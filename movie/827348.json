The portraits form a triptych that are linked to each other and synced to the score. To help maintain the autonomy of each portrait and yet create an intimate grouping, Robert Wilson and architect Filippo Moretti designed a room with angled walls, built within one of the stables of Villa Panza.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gxiLvGREOylvBXmPjY3GRzyWANC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":153964,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lumen Arts","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Winter Fable","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
