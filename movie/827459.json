Becoming some sort of parody of the afternoon chat shows and the exploitation of people living with AIDS as a casual subject of talk on those type of shows in the early 1990,S, the film strikes by the vocabulary used by the teenagers that seem to know enough about HIV/AIDS to be able to subvert the conversation and actually make it funny.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/x1LSjbzuiuKJxd88PYgrulsvrUi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2010-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"So... when did you figure out that you had AIDS?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
