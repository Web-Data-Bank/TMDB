Laying in this strange land, half cemetery half waste-yard, obsolete mutations have been abandoned to create this new ecosystem hanging between life and death. By their shapes, textures and context, each entity is loosely inspired by different films of Cronenberg, such as The Fly, Scanners, Videodrome, Dead Ringers, The Brood, Existenz and Crash. The title is a reference to his film Crimes of the Future.  The installation is surrounded by 5 televisions, lighting the room with different videos made with synthesizers. Each pattern represents a manifestation of the body, such as brain signals, heartbeats, blood etc. While referencing Videodrome and the evolution of the electronic image, it also suggests the idea that the body is a form of technology in itself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3cDDSZNZjC97PYIrvKveFTYKyi5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"House of Skin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
