It is a character story about an average town's citizens in the early twentieth century as depicted through their everyday lives. Using metatheatrical devices, Wilder sets the play in a 1930s theater. He uses the actions of the Stage Manager to create the town of Grover's Corners for the audience. Scenes from its history between the years of 1901 and 1913 play out. Originally broadcast on the Showtime Network, then as part of the PBS series \"Masterpiece Theatre\" (season 33, episode 1).","popularity":1.052,"poster_path":"/shl1N27V5iA3ndXV99Vy3gwxEQv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4343,"logo_path":"/rXq1B1Hnkdnw6soz1zoGcslK3wb.png","name":"Showtime Networks","origin_country":"US"},{"id":24790,"logo_path":"/hXkXnEb2eofddcX7C1Oms81ERAZ.png","name":"Masterpiece","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Our Town","video":false,"vote_average":8.3,"vote_count":3}
