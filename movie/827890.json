Marder). Ceramic sculptures were gardened for a year letting plant life grow on them as their skin. Four super-8 cameras were made into a mobile, thereby also filming the process and its shared motion. To embrace the filmed material as a fictional construction, it was optically printed and altered; to accompany the notion of the sculptures as possible chests, containers of heart, vocal sounds were recorded with Camila de Laborde and weaved into the film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gsSayCl9TtPg0g3Vi5p7bnkwqHm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2021-05-08","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Fictions conjures representations as if it is imagined from the perspective of the plant world.","title":"Fictions","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
