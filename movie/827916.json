The film examines my own emotional responses in the context of how this experience is culturally represented. Painstakingly handmade, the visual and sound treatments evoke different phases of the relationship (from passionate attachment to escalating conflict to inexplicable breakup) and the various phases of the grieving process - from denial, to yearning, to anger, to final liberation: a healing release effected through the making of this film. A triptych of self-portraits-entire camera rolls, each subjected to different methods of extreme interventions on the celluloid itself-are presented in a series of tableaux punctuated by quotes reflecting on romantic love scratched into the filmstrip.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/s5bPNZAbEgbD5vB116Xpm72fVQW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Auto Portrait / Self Portrait Post Partum","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
