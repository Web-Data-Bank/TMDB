Other private school principals, teachers and students, as well as scholars who study education, and some government officials were interviewed. They discuss the causes from different angles. Due to the marketization of education, in order to ensure their vested interests, public schools that originally held public educational resources have adopted strategies such as \"prestigious schools building branch schools\" and \"prestigious schools running private schools\" to privatize public educational resources in order to enjoy exclusive market share. The education management department is also willing to profit from such practices and use this competition to eliminate the idea of independent and pluralistic education. Under the protection of the monopoly of privileged interests and the \"Promotion Law\", many outstanding private schools shut down.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8M5Hsvh3TfuivbZrViisGLi6d6I.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Survival or Destruction","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
