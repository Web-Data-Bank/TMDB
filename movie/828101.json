She is joined by a strange old man dressed in a transparent raincoat. There is a scythe about three blades on Grandfather's shoulder. He persistently pulls the girl \"to the church\" - to baptize someone, and the \"first comer\" should be the godfather. \"I can't go to church,\" the girl objects. - There's a young, funny father there. I will laugh at him...\"  So she follows the old man past a blooming meadow, along a fast, cold river... Weaves a wreath along the way, decorating it with colored ostrich feathers caught from the water. A lot of events will happen along the way - one is more incomprehensible than the other, and then there will be a wedding and girls in embroidered sundresses with songs will carry garlands of hay on their shoulders with ribbons, red plows will float down the river, and in the foreground is a girl with a groom.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nXE0WnKu0YPUIctJissBQKR7Ksu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":318,"logo_path":"/q0UG4oZERwIywJdDPF4lRlvdYGW.png","name":"CTB Film Company","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2002-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kostroma","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
