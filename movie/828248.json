Story Of","overview":"Rumah Api is an alternative space in Kuala Lumpur, which is dedicated to spreading the DIY punk ethos of non-conformity and counterculture in its area. It exists by putting into practice the broader societal values of self-organization, solidarity and people working together to build stronger communities. Unfortunately, despite their long and exhausting struggles, the house was eventually demolished due to controversial SUKE highway construction. It took 2 years for me to finished this short documentary project. Intentionally make it a short one and raw. I don't want to make it long and show a typical squat video of gig and stuff. Let other team and people make a long one. But I do hope you enjoy this video.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2WduJP0HX5tL9MIcdmYFq5OMzfX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MY","name":"Malaysia"}],"release_date":"2019-08-23","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rumah Api.
