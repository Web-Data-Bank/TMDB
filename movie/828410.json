This Behind the Music is a look at the accomplishments of a modern musician who used his extensive talents to create a new blend of rock, reggae, and blues that has topped the charts throughout the 1990's. Kravitz comments on not only how he has attempted to prove his critics wrong with the release of his new album \"5\", but also his childhood in Beverly Hills, growing up surrounded by celebrities, and his lifelong commitment to music. Kravitz also discusses his short and turbulent marriage to his one true love, actress Lisa Bonet, and the life changes that followed after the birth of their daughter, Zo√ò. Includes interviews with band members, Mark Seliger (photographer), Cynthia Garrett (VH1 VJ), Rick Rubin, Anthony DiCurtis (Rolling Stone review editor), and Cree Summer (actress).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4IckZZ3i1ClKecUkKZVg9ZilKxL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Behind the music Lenny Kravitz","title":"Behind the music Lenny Kravitz","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
