It explores the unanswered questions that arise in the face of tragedy and in the deaths of those who are far, far too young. It is a meditation on life, on death, and on purpose. The film imagines a final reckoning between Anne Frank (Aubrey Peeples) and God (Lorraine Toussaint). It is a reminder of the effect that just one person, even a young girl hidden away, can have on the world","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tORvuQiZwgm5UujiV7qFE0TAF1k.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":154105,"logo_path":null,"name":"Archer Back Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":154106,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anne Frank Meets God Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anne Frank Meets God","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
