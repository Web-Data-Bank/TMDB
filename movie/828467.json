The door closes, but jams. The station closes down for the night. They're stuck. Between the ages of 17 and 70, from different backgrounds and social classes, they have little in common, other than their gender. They try to work together to unlock the door, to get help. And fail. As a group, as individuals, as a conversation. But a long night is ahead of them, confined and bored, anxious and indifferent, submissive and aggressive, forgotten and found - to break free, to grow up, to discover what it is to be a man in the 21 century.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dFHciFc5nEYEogqYWfcuLxIEkVf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Man's Land","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
