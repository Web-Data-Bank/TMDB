I went to ask men and women of all ages and from all walks of life to pose for my camera, with their favorite object, with their Rosebud. By way of introduction I told them the following: Choose an object with which you have a special connection. A unique bond. Almost superstitious. An object that represents you. Who would be like your double. An object that participates in your identity. An object that talks about you like no one has ever talked about. An object when you are no longer there that will take the place of you. It doesn't matter what. Regardless of its price, its rating. It may or may not be a work of art. The main thing is the strength of the bond that unites you. Its truth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fpWTwLLLDL6Cft07OmLTjrLmiBg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Petites lumières humaines","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
