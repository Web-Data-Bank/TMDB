He is then caught up in three episodes by his past, represented by his ex-partners, Lucas and Caroline, as well as his mother and sister, who appear one after the other in his apartment. Étienne falls back into his old patterns, his relatives only wanting an image of the virile man they have made of him and whom he is trying to embody. He becomes aware of it the moment a young man appears and thus has the chance to drop his mask, to assume who he is, in an unexpected way but unique to himself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yZI7Lze6whd2Bqb6CYIRMFYIMIP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":166340,"logo_path":null,"name":"Split Screens Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2020-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Proper Man","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
