It's also a film about film, or more exactly, about the process of making a documentary film, in which the author and the protagonist fight for control over the story and content. It's not important who the winner of this battle is, because their joint effort to make a film represents a testimony about our differences and peculiarities. This film shows how the adventure of shooting a film can be utterly unpredictable, and also a great fun.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3nQkkFYdbZFOGkbpCBRldGfpdLz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":154151,"logo_path":null,"name":"Restart Laboratorij","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love Thy Neighbour","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
