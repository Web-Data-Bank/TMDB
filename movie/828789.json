Tadashi lives alone with his younger sister Kyoko, who has returned to Japan after a divorce. The older brother tries desperately to get rid of it, but in fact, the two siblings have an incestuous relationship, and Kyoko is possessed by Izuna, who is used by Kyoko's ex-husband who resents the relationship. The screen is black and white and eerie. Izuna smiles fearlessly at her. A brother and sister who cannot settle their warped love. With elaborate art reminiscent of Japanese houses and customs of the 1950s, the film brilliantly depicts a mature mystery world with a nostalgic flavour.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cEbbdhEoYepouZHiZ9VYUIXX4mr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Sister And Izuna","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
