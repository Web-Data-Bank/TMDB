There is almost no text, as there is not much more interesting to say.  Each one lives the autistic condition of their choice or is little away from it.  In reality, only an old man, sitting patiently at the side of the road, watching the crowds of people coming and going, arriving or leaving.  A voayer interested in that movement, which marks the actions of newcomers, but does not interfere with their destinies.  What is that place, what does it represent?  Will it be a dream, a ship, or ...... just ....... UTOPIA?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uh6jVYz7aGZybvAkAu64TKngQGS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-02","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"NENHURES - onde os sonhos s達o reais e a vida n達o","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
