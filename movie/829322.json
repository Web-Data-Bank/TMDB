For the past 5 summers, her family has performed her original stageplays for a small audience in their town of Iron River, Michigan. In this sixth season, we follow the creative process of writing, rehearsing, and performing the play. Family bonds between her brother, Chad, and her mother, Kate, are strengthened and put to the test by the mishaps and chaos of coordinating a production with limited resources. Along the way we see Jazmineâ€™s personal struggle for independence, her yearning for a romantic partner, and how a single spark of creativity can spread joy throughout a community.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/g4jNmy5EV2DS9zrVMXhY85Mhft2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Iron Family","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
