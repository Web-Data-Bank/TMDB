What sort of magic? It is the magic that every man in some degree experiences during his life at the sight of a young woman. The film talks about Achilles and the daughter of the Priest of Apollo but since then I read an 1841 account of how George Washington was smitten when unexpectedly he saw a young woman sitting under a tree in the wilds of what is now western Pennsylvania reading a poem. He was young, too, and if the story is true he must have forgotten Martha, to whom he was then engaged. But the story of the magic is true - through thousands of years it has been the same surprising story.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bolex","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
