Questions about creative survival and perseverance during lockdown, as well as the overwhelming effects of merciless gentrification, are actively raised and discussed by the community. Part documentary, part love letter to the scene, filmmaker and musician Danny Alexander explores the creative impulses that are driving musicians today while paying close attention to the endangered status of Toronto as an incubator for the arts. Featuring interviews with prominent contributors such as Sook-Yin Lee, Dan Burke, Luna Li, Vypers, Alaska B, and TRP.P, owners of historic venues like the Horseshoe Tavern, and local politicians who are championing the arts, No Tickets At The Door examines the importance of music communities in the modern age and what is at stake if a city is no longer hospitable towards them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/idS3DPm9PjPLuiIBAALBifMsiHD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Tickets at the Door","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
