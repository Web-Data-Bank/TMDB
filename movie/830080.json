The  main  character  reflects the events that skiers have to face in their quest for adventure, overcoming the  boundaries  and  stereotypes  set  in  society.  The  film  is  a  peculiar  mixture  of  genres,  which  allows  the  boundaries  of  reality  and  fiction  to  merge.  Storyline  is  dominated in two sides – a space where the main character lives and the other 50 locations over Latvia and Estonia. Movie surprises the viewer with breath-taking urban skiing action. The filming is done under challenging circumstances - pedestrians, police...., and the operators mostly have only one chance to capture the frame.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aoZ08fac7gRY1BmFbk4dQaTmrkA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2020-01-31","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ODA","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
