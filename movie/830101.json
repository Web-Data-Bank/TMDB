And to make things worse, her job is uneventful and unfulfilling. And even more disappointing, is the fact that her current relationship is lacking that excitement and raw passion that it once made her feel. Enter Dallas (Evan Stone) a convict on the run, who walks into Alex's life and overnight changes everything for her, but not for the better. Dallas convinces Alex to be his partner in crime and she does so willingly for the shear fact that Dallas is unlike anyone Alex has ever been with before...he is dangerous, bold and the adrenaline rush that she gets when she is with him to her makes all the danger worthwhile. What Alex soon realizes though, is that choices have consequences that aren't always what you expect. Sometimes on the quest for happiness, you get more than you bargain for.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/n5mKA0fl1KCVqdgBsikjD61pjDx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7840,"logo_path":"/pXHXO1qKuQEDv8NDvoNmSaV4gvi.png","name":"Wicked Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A desperate small town girl, a dangerous stranger with trouble on his mind…when their paths cross, it will leave you…","title":"Breathless","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
