In June, 1864, President Abraham Lincoln signed the Yosemite Grant, making it a California State Park. It became famous through  the writings of Horace Greeley and the efforts of John Muir. Cinematographer Dennis Burkhart captures in this video the magnificence of Yosemite Valley (El Capitan, Bridalveil Fall, Half Dome), the High Sierra (John Muir Trail, Tuolumne Meadows, Tioga Pass) and the Mariposa Grove of giant sequoias. The camera catches the wildlife that roams the 1,1170 square miles of Yosemite, i.e. the mule deer, mountain lion, black bear, coyotes, bighorn sheep, and the rare peregrine falcon. This video  reveals why 3.8 million visitors come each year and stand before awe-inspiring panoramas they will never forget.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gND46t0xdI5ldCErDzslgORcawZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":138405,"logo_path":null,"name":"Encounter Video inc","origin_country":""},{"id":72120,"logo_path":null,"name":"Questar Video","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Breathtaking valleys, gouged by glaciers.
