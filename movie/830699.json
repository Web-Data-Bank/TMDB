The film touches upon the importance of friendship, identity, and the generational differences between those born into different cultural contexts from their parents. This mercurial coming-of-age film includes the elements that most enjoy from the genre—the freewheeling spirit of youth and rebellion—but is interrupted by phantasmagorical reveries from the lead actor’s complex interior world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8Ol592y6pxDCi2Q7v3jDn0zJG17.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-02-10","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fardosa","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
