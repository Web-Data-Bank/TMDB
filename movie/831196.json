He showed the constant change of the dynamic and calm moments of walking and the alternation of light and dark in the rocky landscape.” (Simona Mehnert)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ce4lQZUqWvHQJLzg8UiEvuZ8RQS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ravine","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
