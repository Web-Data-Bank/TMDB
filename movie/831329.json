In a deeply personal meditation on the power of looking in his own life, he guides us through the riches of the visible world, a kaleidoscope of extraordinary imagery across cultures and eras. At a time when we are more assailed by images than ever, he reveals how looking makes us who we are, lying at the heart of the human experience, empathy, discovery and thought. He shares the pleasure and pain of seeing the world, in all its complexity and contradiction, with eyes wide open. As the COVID-19 pandemic brings another dramatic shift of perspective, he reaches out to the other lookers for their vision from lockdown, and he travels to the future to consider how his looking life will continue to develop until the very end.","popularity":0.89,"poster_path":"/1a9VheQ9a1xFQTLRPgvoGr0L033.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82299,"logo_path":null,"name":"BofA Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Story of Looking","video":false,"vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":5}
