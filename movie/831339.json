A story that has remained little known for half a century and which today - for the first time - brings the man who convinced Fellini to make a sort of mockumentary Federico Fellini’s Notebook, perhaps the first in the history of Italian cinema , using a scheme that the great author born in Rimini would have later reused with other films such as Intervista, Prova d'Orchestra and Roma.  A human and artistic journey that would then be repeated immediately after with The Clowns, destined to make Fellini a forerunner of modern television.","popularity":0.896,"poster_path":"/4QYXWKuzh3XqXUO0waXhiwHhDln.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-12-03","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fellini – Io sono un Clown","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
