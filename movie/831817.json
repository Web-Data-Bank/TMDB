Ian Lester (Jacob Sirof) is having a good week.  His part-time job as a filmmaker is starting to gain momentum while his day job offers an opportunity for love.  All of the pieces for success seem to be in place as Ian's agent Matthew Skinner (Nate Cohen) prepares a deal to set the box office ablaze.  With a little help from outlandish local film critic Jane Muir (Glorinda Marie), his offbeat friends John (Scott Hastings) and Sabine (Elena Gardella), and an unusual homeless man (Viktor Vaughn), Ian's destiny comes into sharp focus.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/f70WyY3XeqscR4pVqJmAtGGVhr8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":154589,"logo_path":null,"name":"Top of the Slide Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Less Miserable","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
