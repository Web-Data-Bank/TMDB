Since only police officers are allowed to carry firearms, Ma Shan is alarmed about the deadly possibilities of the theft, and he sets out to find his weapon; however, the memories of Ma Shan's friends are as hazy as his own regarding the wedding, and no one can tell who drove him home. The situation comes to a head when Ma Shan's former girlfriend arrives in town for a visit and is soon found shot dead with the bullets matching those used in his gun.","popularity":1.63,"poster_path":"/rG14eUFqiJUmKv5L1kdljPgVFkV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14714,"logo_path":"/dSHaVKtBCpMU5VP9wMbTkqov62i.png","name":"China Film Group Corporation","origin_country":"CN"},{"id":3393,"logo_path":"/5MLWHoeoDJ3MOH5KPQfVd7X1ASI.png","name":"Huayi Brothers Pictures","origin_country":"CN"},{"id":12363,"logo_path":null,"name":"Taihe Film Investment Co.
