Lara originally plans to sell the shop quickly, but switches course to fulfill her aunt's last wish - to have one of her teas awarded by the prestigious International Council of Tea Sommeliers. With the help of handsome local flower expert Matt, Lara sets out to recreate a long lost \"love potion\" tea. One problem - the tea's secret ingredient is the extinct Kissing Falls rose. As Lara and Matt work together, she finds herself not only falling for Matt but for the town itself.","popularity":3.409,"poster_path":"/nvG45HHVgqS0R9W3MAkj0Uv1qdn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2021-08-06","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Together Forever Tea","video":false,"vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":7}
