We often wonder if something is missing from our lives, or if the things we want are still attainable. In Mohit Jaswal’s NIGHT ON SIXTH, Yola (Yola Lu) has all of these thoughts, and more swirling around in her head. While out with her friends, she impulsively decides to ditch them and yearns to escape, if only for the evening. During her journey around Austin, she meets new and interesting people which leads her to question everything. A charming, funny, and sometimes poignant film, NIGHT ON SIXTH delivers a sweet and grounded story about connection.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ngluFOd9Z6hUCs2bY9R6YBhA0EX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Night on Sixth","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
