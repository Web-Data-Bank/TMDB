It does not require the audience to enter a specific display area, but actively enters the location of the audience, participates in everyone's immediate situation in a one-on-one form, bringing different perceptions in different locations. In a word, the \"guide\" is integrated with the viewer's environment and the screen he faces, like a ghost that can break in at any time. It allows the viewer to find the crack between the immediate surroundings of his sight, the cracks between others, and the cracks between himself, and then show the secrets in the depths of the cracks.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yKUQQsWT5O3qZ9mksM0wEjrJpXh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guide","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
