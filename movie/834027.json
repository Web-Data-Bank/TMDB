He has amassed thousands of hours of footage, from 16mm home movies made with his brothers, to time spent in iconic roles for blockbuster movies like Top Gun, The Doors, Tombstone, and Batman Forever. This raw, wildly original and unflinching documentary reveals a life lived to extremes and a heart-filled, sometimes hilarious look at what it means to be an artist and a complex man.","popularity":9.892,"poster_path":"/vWJKmfmjpkFeTbUGep6t7w5TexA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":41077,"logo_path":"/1ZXsGaFPgrgS6ZZGS37AqD5uU12.png","name":"A24","origin_country":"US"},{"id":85984,"logo_path":"/2CaCVxh0IbjIpLmqvLxyAHBVGaU.png","name":"Boardwalk Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":154936,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cartel Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":93105,"logo_path":"/asuzX794BM1gCettTxUoLxGNovd.png","name":"IAC Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":158724,"logo_path":null,"name":"ValArt Ltd","origin_country":""},{"id":160513,"logo_path":null,"name":"HelMel Studios","origin_country":""},{"id":157325,"logo_path":null,"name":"TwainMania","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The life you live is the story you tell.","title":"Val","video":false,"vote_average":7.085,"vote_count":117}
