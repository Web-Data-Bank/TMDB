First-time director Vincent D'Onofrio (Full Metal Jacket, \"Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent\") explores love, greed and ruthlessness in this twisted musical/horror hybrid, telling the story of a young band who heads to the woods to get away from their everyday lives in order to focus on writing new songs. Hoping to walk away from the trip with new tunes that will score them their big break, they instead find themselves in the middle of a nightmare beyond comprehension.","popularity":1.763,"poster_path":"/re1enuTSrNE4J83daXqmhS4eQ0V.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don't Go in the Woods","video":false,"vote_average":2.5,"vote_count":10}
