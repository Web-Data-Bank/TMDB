This gleefully sinister film is the fifth that Andy directed for Habito and the first produced by Hornet. In it, our redheaded hero dukes it out with a werewolfish cast of flesh-eating rival buyers who are all competing for our hero’s dream home. With morbidly transfixing animations and gory humor, Andy brilliantly delivers on Habito’s tagline: “Hell or Habito.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Habito ‘The Climb’","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
