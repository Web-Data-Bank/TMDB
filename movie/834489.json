When we see Reinaldo as an adult, his mother persists on having a straight son attend an upcoming wedding, which causes much of his distraction at work. That is until he interviews Claire, a candidate whose valuable professional experience goes unnoticed by Reinaldo until she strikes him as a great candidate to get things done in the office.
