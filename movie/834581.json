Waiting for the final party, several students pass the time at a city pool, as if anticipating the emotional whirlwind they are about to experience. The action takes place somewhere in Poland, where ‘LGBT free zones’ are a reality in 2020. It’s a story about young people, their problems and romantic endeavours in the era of the Internet and social apps, when creating genuine relationships is unnaturally difficult.","popularity":0.85,"poster_path":"/vMFTsZR1U0PSDiCIJa48tEzH9s0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82862,"logo_path":null,"name":"No Sugar Films","origin_country":"PL"},{"id":11240,"logo_path":"/i59ItaKFdxJ7Yi6w2s7CML0LBvI.png","name":"PISF","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2020-07-27","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love Tasting","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":10}
