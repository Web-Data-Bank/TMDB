The news-coverage in those days was aimed at strengthening the public opinion that Korea and Japan were indissolubly allied. This film, as many other films in those days, was meant to clearly propagate this pact. However, the director of this film, Shimizu Hiroshi, only shows streetscenes. He films without the ideology that was so common in this kind of films. He registers the people in the street in their daily occupations.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1CgCmQD2QTnpYsqsLyv2sdy4ti0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1940-07-19","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Keijo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
