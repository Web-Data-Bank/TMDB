The twins, who call their musical group \"Glassy Stares\", isolate themselves from life and spend their time writing lyrics and composing.  Glassy Stares; an ecstatic insight into the truth in the mists of schizophrenia; knotting the bond with reality with guitar strings; It is a story of brotherhood in which the subjects are mixed with praise and the transformation into music by going beyond making music.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u0vcShMr3WJFzkRvqMIVENITX4f.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":199705,"logo_path":"/hrTOCd52UdJfuLEKxJCZM3029OO.png","name":"Esrik Hakikat","origin_country":"TR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Glassy Stares","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
