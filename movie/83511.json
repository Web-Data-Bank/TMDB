Drawings its roots from punk rock, hardcore evolved into a dedicated, self-contained movement, unconcerned with success in the mainstream. The documentary follows seven bands in the summer of 1995, ranging from Bronx inner-city youth to Long Island suburbanites to Hare Krishna devotees. N.Y.H.C. is a surprisingly in-depth and non-exploitive look into a vital and often neglected music community.","popularity":1.096,"poster_path":"/upEP07FjOFtHpdiShROLbb4oZ7n.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7057,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aviator Films","origin_country":""},{"id":157640,"logo_path":null,"name":"Velebit Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"N.Y.H.C.","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":4}
