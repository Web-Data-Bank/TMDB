Fourteen-year-old Jane Blond thought getting through high school was difficult enough with her dad in prison and her mother dating. Throw in being bullied by the popular girl who has everything, and it's completely unbearable. But when terrorists kidnap a boy, she cares about him. She knows she is the only one who can save him. Jane must rely on her courage and cunning and on a computer genius, a teen with Asperger's, and a parrot with an attitude.  Why die another day when you're in the crosshairs of this luscious lady of international intrigue? That's What 1 am Doing. She Knows What She Wants.","popularity":0.875,"poster_path":"/gbpfq95nVTVrBsZxHK38XWLcy0i.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1891,"logo_path":"/8wZFrxv9YsWUeqdRa2k33xBABLQ.png","name":"Adam \u0026 Eve","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-01-02","revenue":15,"runtime":118,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jane Blonde DD7","video":true,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
