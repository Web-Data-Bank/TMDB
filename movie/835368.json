The topics: sexual (borderline) experiences, traditional role models and the current understanding of male sexuality. The result is that the interviewees themselves subsequently begin to speak openly and frankly about their own experiences. And to reflect on their sexuality. To which social ideals does the male sex see itself committed, and do \"typical male traditions\" still exist at all today?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xwrjcXzIaqASvwKoWcFeAGupZfB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88759,"logo_path":"/9qsw4Bwz8MpiHyoj3fOB7Encen3.png","name":"StickUp Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2022-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Strong Sex","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
