The singers -Keiko, Wakana, and Hikaru- visit their home towns and talk about their childhood and early experiences with singing and performing. They also talk about how their different singing styles work together to make a unique sound. They rehearse, select costumes, and plan the order of the setlist. They play several acoustic concerts following up to their big January anniversary concert. The concert is a success, and key parts of songs that they had planned and rehearsed obsessively turn out just the way they had intended and make a big impact.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dYCsNw7VljluGwRdlSSVl4LO3lD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2018-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kalafina 10th Anniversary Film: Yume ga Tsumugu Kagayaki no Harmony","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
