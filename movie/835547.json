Let's trace the history of Russian visual culture — from the appearance of the Cyrillic alphabet and folk crafts to constructivism, Soviet DIY and metamodern. Let's analyze the visual language of Russian icons, find the motifs of folk costume in modern fashion, look at the Baroque, classicism, Art Nouveau and other styles from the perspective of modern design. We will try to decode our culture and find something valuable in the forgotten together with well-known designers Anton Schneider, Regina Turbina, Alexey Ivanovsky, Tatiana Egoshina, design studios FYD, CLAN, ONY,Just Be Nice, White Russian Studio and more.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qTMhpAlyNZkx0rYuA3NgTRTiJtD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2021-06-16","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lepota","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
