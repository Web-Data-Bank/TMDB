The villagers, many of them in tears, cheered and clapped as the men of Grimethorpe Colliery marched back to work accompanied by the villageâ€™s world-famous brass band. The miners and their families had endured months of hardship. It had all been for nothing. The miners had lost the strike called on March 6th 1984. They would lose a lot more in the years to come. But was it a good thing for the country that the miners lost their last battle?","popularity":1.456,"poster_path":"/cWDFgBVGZEaeebklXUjAI54nrKX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":27856,"logo_path":"/jLMbth7gIW0UMxGqHB5zuHk1iJk.png","name":"Channel 5","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mrs Thatcher Vs The Miners","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
