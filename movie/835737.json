Agnes—the victims’ mother and grandmother—decided to contact him in the hope it would help her heal from this tragedy and give it meaning. As the law didn’t allow her to meet Leonard, she wrote to him instead. Their exchange led them to join in a mutual fight to promote restorative justice—an alternative stance on justice based on prevention and victim/offender dialog. Their struggle echoes those of others families, bringing us to examine what restorative justice means and the hopes it sparks.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9KZzHV7U1tDRmUeE2uLLNnEeBAf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97782,"logo_path":"/xPgTSHpGRJR2JCyMDvlE7XehTRw.png","name":"Talweg Production","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":127436,"logo_path":"/85hn0WZVj2wpm7scTkrQz76lKJ7.png","name":"LCP - Assemblée nationale","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2016-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Another Justice","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
