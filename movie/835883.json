But before that stand four years of work on a construction site of superlatives. The director Wolfgang Ettlich and his cameraman Hans-Albrecht Lusznat have followed the construction of the new Munich soccer arena since the first groundbreaking. They have recorded several phases of the construction and did thereby get to know the microcosmos of a large construction site from the inside: The logistics, with which hundreds of construction workers have to be coordinated, and the steady growth of the stadium all the way to the perfectly conceptualized illuminated structure, with VIP-boxes, mass restaurants, and Europe’s largest parking garage.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":162,"logo_path":"/pIK5tsFVxjoXTJGcd0nYhiL1kn1.png","name":"BR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":8677,"logo_path":null,"name":"MGS Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2004-05-29","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Observations by Wolfgang Ettlich","title":"Der Fussballtempel - Eine Arena Für München","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
