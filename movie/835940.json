The sophisticated score with a libretto by acclaimed theatre director Peter Sellars comes to life thanks to the Berliner Philharmoniker, whose intimate knowledge of Adams’s music stems from the composer himself: He attended the orchestra’s rehearsals. In the role of the Evangelist, Bubeck, Cummings and Medley lead through the narrative. A stunning highlight is Lazarus’s aria, sung by tenor Peter Hoare. But at the heart of the piece are Mary Magdalene and her sister Martha during the last days before Jesus’s death, impressively performed by mezzo-sopranos Kelley O’Connor and Tamara Mumford.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ebvLxXda3Si79RtjEOCIIRrmJHu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79887,"logo_path":null,"name":"Berliner Philharmoniker Recordings","origin_country":""},{"id":26290,"logo_path":"/o7QeTO6M5CLKZP7RYuIxoHbTqET.png","name":"Unitel","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2017-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":155,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"John Adams: The Gospel According to the Other Mary","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
