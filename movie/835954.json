Music in this city sounds without stopping: a cosmopolitan Venezuelan who settled in Moscow is preparing the presentation of the album of his band – an important event of the underground rock scene. A Chinese pianist from the Conservatory, who is in love with Rachmaninoff, is preparing for a serious exam. American and Kazakh are experimenting with formats and looking for a listener among the neighbors in the entrance, inviting them to an apartment party. The Cuban ensemble once again takes to the stage of the restaurant with national songs and dances. A Ghanaian drummer plays with a gospel choir at a Protestant service. Each of them exists in its own small worlds, accessible to the listener; and these worlds make up the musical landscape of Moscow.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Listening to Moscow","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
