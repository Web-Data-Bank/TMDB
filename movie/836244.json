Il lato oscuro.","overview":"Between the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, Cesare Lombroso was one of the most famous Italians in the world. He measured the shape and size of the skulls of many criminals, and drew the conclusion that their somatic features were reminiscent of the primitive man. He thus developed a new pseudoscience. Through some short docudrama reconstructions and the archive documents  by the “Lombroso” Museum of Criminal Anthropology in Turin, the film retraces some of the milestones in the life of the scientist who, to this day, still raises controversy and heated debates.","popularity":0.877,"poster_path":"/rQJ2wzbnzneM0NPvXJYQNw6TS3t.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cesare Lombroso.
