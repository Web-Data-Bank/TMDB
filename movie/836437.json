The film was screened worldwide in cinemas and on television. Lye superimposed the word for “peace” in many different languages over some of his kinetic sculptures, while a United Nations choir sang related music by Henry Brant that combined many national styles. Lye’s work was selected because the United Nations wanted to overcome language barriers, using visual images with a strong emotional impact and “universal appeal”. Lye was delighted to be associated with a message of world peace.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/d0lBjO36ZrHjcds5lXfD4sk70Mb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1959-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fountain of Hope/Peace","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
