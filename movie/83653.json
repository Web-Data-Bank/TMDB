Their collaborative work has resulted in great tasting food and an explosion of consumer awareness about the benefits of eating local.  Attention being paid to the local food movement comes at a time when the failings of our current industrialized food system are becoming all too clear. For the first time in history, our children's generation is expected to have a shorter lifespan than our own. The quality, taste and nutritional value of the food we eat has dropped sharply over the last fifty years. Shipped from ever-greater distances, we have literally lost sight of where our food comes from and in the process, we've lost a vital connection to our local community and to our health.","popularity":1.321,"poster_path":"/nYu0wIcIKCcXxghyTg1J42mKirU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14443,"logo_path":null,"name":"Optic Nerve Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2009-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The local food movement takes root.","title":"Ingredients","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":4}
