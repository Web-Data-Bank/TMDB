The film puts us face to face with a private world of picnics, birthday parties, and interior lives, worlds that been hidden and preserved in deteriorating and aged film, offering a meditation of fragmented and alternative view of India’s histories.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"enroute or “of a Thousand Moons”","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
