Again.  Three terrible things happen in a single day. Essun, a woman living an ordinary life in a small town, comes home to find that her husband has brutally murdered their son and kidnapped their daughter. Meanwhile, mighty Sanze -- the world-spanning empire whose innovations have been civilization's bedrock for a thousand years -- collapses as most of its citizens are murdered to serve a madman's vengeance. And worst of all, across the heart of the vast continent known as the Stillness, a great red rift has been torn into the heart of the earth, spewing ash enough to darken the sky for years. Or centuries.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":559,"logo_path":"/jqWioYeGSyTLuHth0141bTGvu6H.png","name":"TriStar Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fifth Season","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
