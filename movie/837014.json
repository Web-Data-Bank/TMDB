The poem featured in the film, created and narrated by artist Yasmin Nicholas, explains the artist’s desire to explore the diaspora through her own heritage. Three ancestral spirits visit the artist, and provide her with an understanding of the identity of an artist, by a process of validation, shown through the granting of gifts. Sequence to a Dream contrasts bright dresses with the dreariness of London’s urban scenes, showing how one can change oneself through knowledge and culture.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sequence To A Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
