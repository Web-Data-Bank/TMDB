The suspicions of the young inspector Samira Masson, whose first investigation this is, naturally lead her to an association for the defence of the animal condition which had been orchestrating a media hype against the company for some time. But the corpse turns out to be that of an undercover cop, belonging to a genuine and little-known division of the police, specialising in national veterinary surveillance. Etienne Barjac, commander of the IGPN, the police force, is sent to investigate.","popularity":0.986,"poster_path":"/kqACLeErtYA07aqctu1gMVY2GW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La mort est dans le pré","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":4}
