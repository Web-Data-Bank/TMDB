Streets, squares, zoos, houses, roofs, men, women, roads, but all of it seen as if that world was someone else's, as if it was lost in time. The world is there, but there is no place to settle. A film that speaks about everyday’s life, but with the voice of the sleepwalkers. Some sort of blind, nocturnal continuum that no one knows for sure what it is.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ecapdNEX0Ou1YMDNGp5mtUWU1We.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2017-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"El estanque","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
