Her father, Shaman Tetsushi, makes Kengo see Sayuri's spirit and begins living with Sayuri again.  Sayuri is cute. It's a ghost, but I'm not scared at all.  On the contrary, he enthusiastically teaches the recipe to Kengo, who cannot cook, until he can reproduce the same taste as Sayuri.  Even though I can see the dream of music and the spirit of my lover so clearly, I can't grasp it.  Even though he had such itchy days, he was still happy.  However, one day, a so-called love triangle incident occurred in which the prayer's daughter, Kaika, liked Kengo.  Umihana had a bad taste of exorcising anything, whether it was a demon or a kind-hearted spirit.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/nOX1rPIGoa9PvxQO5WScJ2dZmLk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2021-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shaman’s Daughter","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
