RPWL performed all of its hits in the studio, which should also please the band's fans. Mostly proven hits from early work sound, everything is filmed with camera raids on musicians to create the atmosphere of a live concert. In addition, the release includes two live recordings of Pink Floyd's interpretations in the studio in 2000, when the debut album was recorded.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oiD4dsy6LaJ2JUX53R1wHfFsK1r.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":176,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"RPWL - God Has Failed: Live & Personal","video":true,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
