If the front is reserved for White, when they have no more room, Black must give up theirs, to the rear. It's the law. But that day, the teenager refuses to give way to a White. Claudette Colvin says no. Arrested, she pleaded not guilty and sued the city, a first. However, we will not make an example of it. We will wait for Rosa Parks, a lighter-skinned seamstress, who, nine months after Claudette, will make the same gesture, soon supported by the young Martin Luther King. History is on the move. Claudette Colvin allowed everything, but she is the one we have forgotten.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6T9I4SUatjkOY6eqQqmNT8kXs7R.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/eLvjHPYZ12GR58lrDgg6MXZp2a3.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Noire","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
