This hour-long documentary is told through the point of view of those closest to victim Jennifer Dulos and husband Fotis Dulos. We dig into their marriage, the breakdown in their love for each other, and the carefully hidden instances of aggression and fear in the last years of their relationship. The story will culminate with police investigation, murder charges and Dulosâ€™ suicide.","popularity":0.871,"poster_path":"/dJrgIPmSZryBXdpQCjnzONYV8I3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beyond the Headlines: The Jennifer Dulos Story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
