In 1992, Mark and director Martin Bell returned to India to film many of the same performers. The resulting short, THE AMAZING PLASTIC LADY (1995), focuses on Pinky, a ten-year-old acrobat who, like the children in STREETWISE, lives on society’s margins. The film also continued Bell’s work with editor Nancy Baker.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oOjPxNbDEHHsaz6Wg8VZVQhdBkv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1995-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Amazing Plastic Lady","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
