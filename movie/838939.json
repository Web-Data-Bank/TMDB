These two strands expose the fallacies in the \"debate,\" manufactured by anti-science forces, that creationism is a valid scientific alternative to evolution.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Dinosaurs in Heaven","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
