We follow him on his tour with his band, Firewind, but also on his solo projects. With him and his colleagues, we travel into the magical world of hard rock, where many taboos, social and other issues are being analyzed, while at the same time a very special personality is revealed. This course of 20 years was not paved with rose petals. It was a hard road through persecution, sweat, hunger and immigration, until the final vindication of his close collaboration with Ozzy Osbourne.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jNZzJFAUlSzqKePX3mq0eN1h6dk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7255,"logo_path":"/aHu0SirjV9Mi0OrlnFWqZwy50wW.png","name":"EPT","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2018-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gus G.: Life Through Fire","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
