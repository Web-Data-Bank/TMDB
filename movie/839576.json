Marshall began his filming in 1951 and in the 1980s became an activist helping the Ju/’hoansi fight for their land and water rights. Marshall produced over 20 films on the Ju’/hoansi beginning with The Hunters (1957) and culminating with A Kalahari Family (2003).  The project began as an article Alice Apley and I wrote shortly after John’s death and then it evolved into a series of video interviews. Interviewees include: Elizabeth Marshall Thomas, Robert Gordon, Alexandra Eliot Marshall, Cynthia Close, Sandeep Ray, Karma Foley, Jayasinhji (Bapa) Jhala, and Rakhi Jhala.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Remembering John Marshall","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
