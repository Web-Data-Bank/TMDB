Led to one of the first optical printer films produced at The Florida Optical House, Miami, and shot by Albie Krieger. Combines Reg 8mm, 16mm and 35mm with most derived from 16mm. the sources and content are obvious, with the overall experience somewhat unresolved. tho the ending is explicit and direct. hence \"the quickie version\" title for a film that has been reworked in differing versions and number of projectors and screens.
