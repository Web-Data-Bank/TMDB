Unbeknownst to them, something far more sinister guides the cult, and plots the destruction of Annistiem. Warriors, miscreants, and opportunists venture forth into the wood to slay the degenerate creatures, each having their own reasons and rationale. Some for gold, some for purity, and some for the hunt. But deep in the forest, only the trust of an ally, and the cold steel of sword and axe can save oneself from the terrors that lurk within.","popularity":1.723,"poster_path":"/4fl28PoAXFTaIVcziwTh3ByRTWZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":138449,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmhub","origin_country":""},{"id":155771,"logo_path":null,"name":"Red Cloud Consort","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The flower withers.","title":"Spriggan","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
