One day, he and his friend (Kadhal Sugumar) come across a drug dealer which lands them in trouble. What was supposed to be a thriller then becomes a series of unengaging sequences, thanks to underdeveloped characters and low production values. The core plot surrounding astrology was left unexplored after a point. With an aimless screenplay, unnecessary songs, weak humour, ineffective twists and strictly okayish performances from the two lead characters, Thiruvalar Panchankam becomes a tedious affair.","popularity":0.87,"poster_path":"/f1mUIuF6rOwHnK2bUJ5WuVZTXGQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":155789,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alar studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2020-12-11","revenue":1,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thiruvalar Panchankam","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
