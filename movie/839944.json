Swan is a restless dreamer and sometimes she isn't sure where reality stops and fantasyland begins. She enlists her two best girlfriends, the Snow Queen and Pete Finch, to go on a strange and mysterious quest - a quest that ends with one of the most original twist endings ever. Along the way, they encounter political assassination plans, a journey through the Tunnel of Twat and a visit to the Land of Fidget Quim. For absurdist adventure spiced with trademark Jim Holiday sex scenes, Kylie Wilde is Absolutely Adorable.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cquQKy9kz62dzsjWv7x7NXDkpii.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5097,"logo_path":"/cjK2zkmtR2DxHcwqRCXr5SpsLSa.png","name":"VCA Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2003-12-09","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Absolutely Adorable","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
