Kathy, who is prone to paranoia, is especially finding it difficult mentally preparing for a new babysitter. Yet, David soothes her like usual, assuring her that everything will be fine. If she can't trust David, the father of her children and love of her life, who CAN she trust?  Vivian, who is seated alone at a dining table, looking very distracted and satisfied. Her step-son, Carter, joins her, not knowing that his step-sister and Vivan's step-daughter, Lucy, is under the table eating Vivian out. Carter jokes about him being Vivian's favorite step-child.
