EuroBasket 2015 was a unique situation for three post-soviet neighboring countries - the Baltic states, as they were drawn into the same group in the preliminary round and everyone could witness the unique unity between these friendly countries.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mhyCY4S2NFQIaIpcUI3Rv0VNLv8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112129,"logo_path":null,"name":"KULTFILMA","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2016-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"6th Player","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
