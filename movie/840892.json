No incarnation of the subjects exists inside, only the two's voices hovering over the dynamics like extraterrestrial creatures drifting away from the Earth. The atmosphere is dangerous. And the fluid exhibition of sceneries spans from Asia to North America with chaotic velocity, which may relive a spiritual diaspora after fragmentary experiences here and there. In this visual space, the past is unrelentingly flooded away in the fading memory.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ceDhxgHzHGZSsXfUTrR0TD39WL4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wander","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
