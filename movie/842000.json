Shirish moves on, hiding behind the invisible protections afforded to him by class structure, and the visible walls and locked gates of his home. In parallel, Geeta’s guilt drives her to surreptitiously employ Manoj, the victim’s younger brother, intertwining two lives otherwise separated by class and power. The small collision quickly turns into a dramatic suspense, spurred by greed, betrayal, guilt, as the nocuous effects of grave inequality threaten to unwind the very fabric of each of their lives.","popularity":1.197,"poster_path":"/A9PkUncOOvjXFKvajN1IvXtRd47.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2021-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Knot","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
