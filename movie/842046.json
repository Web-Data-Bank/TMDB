But it ended up entirely changing my life and that of my future family.  Which is why I decided to revisit the medicine in 2018, participating in three Ayahuasca ceremonies over the course of one week in Costa Rica, and document the process.  In the film, we tackle my personal story of trying to build London Real into a global media and transformation company while also struggling with my own disconnection from friends, family and my own species.  We also dive deep into the division and tribalism currently facing all of us around the world.","popularity":0.62,"poster_path":"/qPJT7Aye6PFJLULnbMVZ314yFr3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":156019,"logo_path":null,"name":"London Real","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CR","name":"Costa Rica"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2019-12-06","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reconnect: The Movie","video":false,"vote_average":8.2,"vote_count":2}
