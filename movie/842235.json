Unlike their loved ones, Hiroshi Hoshino, Michiko Kiyooka and Minoru Tsukiyama managed to emerge from the bombings. Now in their twilight years, they wish for nothing more than recognition and reparations for those who, like them, had been indelibly harmed by the war – but the Japanese government and even their fellow citizens seem disinclined to acknowledge the past.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/t13c27U21MmPljisKsDiZeYjiF9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":129058,"logo_path":null,"name":"Feather Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2021-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"One night. 100,000 dead.","title":"Paper City","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
