She tries to make them talk about themselves, some answer, others don't. In counterpoint: hunting, dancing, motorcycle riding.  \"I have always wanted to know more about men, to hear about their country, about \"what it's like to be a man\". Curiosity of a little girl, no doubt. But also a woman's desire, a desire to get closer and closer, until the impossible fusion. Juliette du côté des hommes is the film of this curiosity, of this desire. Men who please me tell me their story, tell me about their desires. And I, who listen to them and watch them, tell with these words and these images, my desire for them. Between a marathon and bikers, a hunting party and a card game, a waltz that sails and a tango that sways, there is masculinity that passes. There is - for me - the Other.\" (Claudine Bories)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1gxe7FaihHeT0VifJPk2JvLDsUi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Juliette du côté des hommes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
