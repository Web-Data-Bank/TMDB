At the airport they are received by their tour-guide, Ranga, who appears to be somewhat disturbed upon hearing Googly’s name. An incomprehensible sadness betrays Ranga’s cool demeanor. Googly is awestruck by the beauty of sunset amidst the snow-capped mountains and is inspired to go hiking.  Shorya, though initially reluctant, finally yields. They set out on their trek and the appalling beauty of the mountains overwhelms them. In a moment of romantic fervour, Shorya slips and falls off the cliff and gets stuck on a crest at the edge of a steep fall. Hereafter, the movie follows Googly and Ranga on their individual rescue missions-- Googly’s to save Shorya and Ranga’s to find Googly. And amidst all this, flitting on and off the screen, is a ghastly figure in the cave whom Shorya dismisses as a figment of his own imagination","popularity":0.905,"poster_path":"/8AEzFFyaWbjaN8Lcd1pId6KblKv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":156051,"logo_path":null,"name":"Enoxx Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2021-07-02","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The call for some fun and adventure brings a couple to Dharamshala, a small hill-station nestled in the Himalayas.
