Calixto Bieito, one of the most exciting directors of his generation, directs this dramatised oratorio. With the help of an excellent cast, the period orchestra Les Talens Lyriques and a group of amateur singers which form the chorus at the heart of the narrative, he leads us into dialogue with this work today to confront pain and death.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/AjqGE4tX9cb6s34YFeiBoo6ORe6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":47245,"logo_path":null,"name":"Théâtre Musical de Paris - Châtelet","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"St John Passion","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
