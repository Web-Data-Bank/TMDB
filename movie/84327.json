We open on the triumphant construction of the biggest house in America, a sprawling, 90,000-square-foot mansion inspired by Versailles. Since a booming time-share business built on the real-estate bubble is financing it, the economic crisis brings progress to a halt and seals the fate of its owners. We witness the impact of this turn of fortune over the next two years in a riveting film fraught with delusion, denial, and self-effacing humor.","popularity":6.377,"poster_path":"/9VxMIPT3nGusKhr8084m26vdeTj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1030,"logo_path":"/bus7KzJshT0VMXuKR7dwK5bqPSO.png","name":"Magnolia Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":47940,"logo_path":null,"name":"Evergreen Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":14909,"logo_path":"/8fLjVGiX8adkseQMCIBYt3UYFiO.png","name":"Impact Partners","origin_country":"US"},{"id":10029,"logo_path":"/dvWOehJOwxDSCHiHspvKEmaaWsO.png","name":"Candescent Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-07-06","revenue":714544,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Queen of Versailles","video":false,"vote_average":6.94,"vote_count":174}
