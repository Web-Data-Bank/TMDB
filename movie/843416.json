The cabbie, Clark, throws the vehicle into drive and the two head out into the night… striking up the most unexpected conversation. What begins as amusing chit chat quickly takes a turn towards mysterious and playful, then grows into viscerally honest revelations about relationships, sex and power dynamics, loss and vulnerability. This contained yet kinetic drama explores the complexities of human connection, and proves that a chance encounter with a total stranger can change a person’s life.","popularity":1.189,"poster_path":"/xQeBO3WCivAxG6n8RlyhiHXi45q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":148258,"logo_path":"/7jE6IT7EMkC7g6frJUZRLFrdgNe.png","name":"TeaTime Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Daddio","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
