Humans feed the animals and talk to them. Just a regular day at the zoo. If it were not for the giraffe that was shot dead by the Israeli military; or for the lions who were only allowed to be imported after being sterilised. Timidly, the workers at the zoo start talking about what it means to live and work under occupation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/llzuc2ETd4CTVanlXpc12OEWXSn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"PS","name":"Palestinian Territory"}],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zooland","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
