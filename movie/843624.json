A continuous, fast-paced slideshow of black and white images culled from Google searches of compound words beginning with “dark” form the background for vivid animations of the same words, in an attempt to undermine any viewers’ preconceptions. Wube stresses that while blackness is visible because of the presence of light, darkness, defined as the absence of light, cannot be seen or therefore described.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/b7yukZnFv3jpcqiEIK2kca3j7tT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Darkness","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
