Animation director Yevgeny Fadeev joked, and curator Nadezhda Svirskaya took up the organization: in social networks, the reception of 5-second cartoons was announced, which anyone could send, regardless of their professional level. The initiators expected that the entire program would consist of a couple of minutes, because the open call lasted only a week, but almost 150 films were sent, including from abroad.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shcha, 5 sec - 4","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
