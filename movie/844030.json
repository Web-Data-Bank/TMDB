After months of sleepless nights, a few local residents decided to investigate the source of the smell, forming the Environmental Protection Agency of Kuala Langat. In the documentary-short They Keep Quiet So We Make Noise, we follow two activists in the Environmental Protection Agency of Kuala Langat, Pua Lay Peng and CK Lee, during a night-drive searching for illegal recycling facilities while learning about their fight against the tide of plastic waste being sent to Malaysia from overseas.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"They Keep Quiet So We Make Noise","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
