The Pruitt-Igoe Myth explores the social, economic and legislative issues that led to the decline of conventional public housing in America, and the city centers in which they resided, while tracing the personal and poignant narratives of several of the project's residents. In the post-War years, the American city changed in ways that made it unrecognizable from a generation earlier, privileging some and leaving others in its wake. The next time the city changes, remember Pruitt-Igoe.","popularity":1.619,"poster_path":"/taY9fhUIEGyv9n16t3WJsTVBi8b.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Pruitt-Igoe Myth","video":false,"vote_average":6.675,"vote_count":20}
