He no longer attacks people for blood, and is no longer afraid of crosses. He spends his days with his friend, Helsing XVI, a descendant of vampire researchers. Acting as Helsing’s ghost writer, he writes a fantasy romance novel about the events he witnessed in his past. One day, Alucard is dressed as a “vampire” at a Halloween costume party celebrating the publication of his book. There, he meets Lucy, a university student who dreams of becoming a dentist. As he gradually becomes more attracted to Lucy, his desire to become human grows. For a vampire with the gift of immortality, it is the equivalent of suicide.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rSZixuiTmr3rPViqzKzqW50kKYQ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102631,"logo_path":null,"name":"Takarazuka Revue Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2016-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":137,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vampire Succession","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
