How is democracy created? Who decides a punishment? Where are the center and the periphery of the revolution? Where does it start and where does it end? A brief power vacuum turns into the moment of greatest potentiality, when the beliefs of the past and the strategies for the future are discussed. The film tries to look at the mundane spaces of the city, and to understand whether the historical and revolutionary uncertainty is still there.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/beU2LdwDXefC5vGUBqMQKqNGPJR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2015-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Varta 1, Lviv, Ukraine","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
