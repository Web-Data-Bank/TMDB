So much divides them and, at the same time, so much attracts them to each other. They know each other so well. They are so close to each other. What is the secret behind their bond? What can they learn from each other? Where are they heading pushed by ‘one more moment’ spent together? This ambiguous, surprising and subtle cinema is about halftones when it unfolds in a serene and lazy holiday rhythm touching us with its warmth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/adguqbtfWwIG75YVnF2ZQcmCPQo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-05-31","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Just for a While","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
