Most remarkable about this video is not its careful camera work (shot entirely from a moving vehicle), but the driving that allowed for it – a feat that brings to mind the complementary (and collaborative) relationship between the shooter and the driver. On Becoming a Man was also the title of Paul’s 1995 solo exhibition at the National Gallery of Canada.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1T2EEhYkFOuZ5v6rP3YoD4WI5dl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On Becoming a Man","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
