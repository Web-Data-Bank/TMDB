Diagnosed and treated in the artist’s late twenties, the film reflects an ongoing process of recovery from traumatic brain injury. Portraying drawing as both escape and embrace, a ‘shuttle between inner and outer worlds’, and video as its counterpart medium in time, the film speaks to the communicative power of art to connect, explore and heal trauma.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7Bhmanxes3gShlb9JO6ffYAy1us.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Of drawing and the brain.","title":"Locks & Keys, Water, Trees","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
