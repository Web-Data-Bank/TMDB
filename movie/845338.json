Up on Chicago's North Side, not far from Lake Michigan, is one of American's last great bath houses--Man's Country. Harkening back to those memorable palaces where the likes of Bette Midler could hold center stage one night only to be followed the next by the naughtiest and most outrageous celebrations of the downest and dirtiest sex imaginable, Man's Country is three floors of affirmation that post-Plague safe sex can bring people together for great nights of entertainment, play and, oh, yes, the very best that men can offer one another sexually--and that safe can be just the best there is.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vOMJUCz1OiiIygD4R9jvQyOvlq4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111582,"logo_path":"/lv7W9er923HNeSbVYwQBYtHjd6i.png","name":"Studio 2000","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Man's Country","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
