Featuring the extravagance of Led Zeppelin; the power of Deep Purple; the progressive indulgence of Hawkwind; the intensity of Black Sabbath and the band that defined 'excess all areas', Motley Crue. All the extremes of rock are here - the long hair, the air guitar, the leather, the cider and snakebite that were part of an age when rock pumped out an earth-quaking racket that blasted the dandruff from a thousand mullets.  Interviewees include Alice Cooper, Lemmy of Motorhead, Vic Reeves, Ozzy Osbourne, Nikki Sixx of Motley Crue, Bruce Dickinson of Iron Maiden, Slash of Guns n Roses, Rob Halford of Judas Priest, Rick Parfitt and Francis Rossi of Status Quo.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kGiQM2MoLmypxFTYQWsgQVCJ0PI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When Rock Ruled the World","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
