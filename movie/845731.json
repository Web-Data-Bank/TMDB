This film is concerned with the projected, not just light or the emulsion or the illusion or the projector or the camera, but all of them. The surface of the film, the grain, is remembered when a similar but illusionistic surface appears (just as magnified), crossing the frame. Other times the grain is left to itself. There are the idiosyncratic focusing qualities of shadows acting as diaphragms inside the image. The elusive background confounds itself with the foreground. The notions of appearances and disappearances transform themselves in notions of time. Made with a grant from the Canada Council.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4NIniiYHTEFgnkET0vp8ZIJ1N4z.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"While Revolved","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
