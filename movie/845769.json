Throughout history, rivers have shaped our landscapes and our journeys; flowed through our cultures and dreams. RIVER takes its audience on a journey through space and time; spanning six continents, and drawing on extraordinary contemporary cinematography, including satellite filming, the film shows rivers on scales and from perspectives never seen before. Its union of image, music and sparse, the poetic script will create a film that is both dream-like and powerful, honouring the wildness of rivers but also recognizes their vulnerability.","popularity":2.226,"poster_path":"/txvcYjqgOmVP79twhNz2niHekhI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":156552,"logo_path":null,"name":"River Production Pty Ltd","origin_country":""},{"id":140766,"logo_path":"/qShWBvzvA8rjNOssHbRX7bON0n.png","name":"Arrow Pictures","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":8191,"logo_path":"/bXYH4HA4GqN5mAIn2pRdlqnDRyI.png","name":"Dogwoof","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":86580,"logo_path":"/oqxkMo3DnBclCokJzymJZr7W4M4.png","name":"Stranger Than Fiction Films","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2021-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"River","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":9}
