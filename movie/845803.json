The second directorial work of Hữu Đức (who had by then appeared in a number of early Vietnamese animation project, often responsible for the art), Flying Dream marked ‘the maturity phase’ of Vietnamese animation in general and doll-based stop-motion works in particular.  Flying Dream also bears the spirit of 1970s Eastern European animation through hazy spaces and colours floating freely between reality and a dream-world (created by artist Mai Long), and a score that recalls the best of psychedelic pop music of the time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":139526,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vietnam Animation Studio","origin_country":"VN"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1976-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Vietnamese","iso_639_1":"vi","name":"Tiếng Việt"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Giấc Mơ Bay","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
