This high school election turns buddies into rivals. Youth is cruel. Even music seems to fail to bring liberation to these young souls. This heartfelt coming-of-age story depicts all the embarrassments and excitements, beauty and brutality of juvenescence. Instead of focusing on peer competition and teenage crush, the film sheds light to the importance of self-identity, the need to feel included, and the power of friendship.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rpHXYBXnUeOlAkiye25HqiaYr2h.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":34,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Steps of Youth","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
