Traversing through the highest peaks in Australia, Beau battles injury, fatigue and ultimately himself in his own personal Trial of Miles. Running long distance walking trails is a relatively new era of adventure to existential seekers today- no longer in search of new landscapes, but a new version of themselves, pitting themselves against distance and time. Beau comes to question how and why we drag ourselves and our families into such endeavours, and in the same breath knows that such experiences are the best place to conjure why we do anything.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/q2WlKMKzim3ZbFYlDW8TRSsh9yX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"It’s not about feeling great, it’s about feeling everything.","title":"Trials of Miles","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
