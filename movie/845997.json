As heads of palliative care at Prague’s General University Hospital they face the inevitability of the end on a daily basis. Yet what perhaps makes their job harder is the myriad options now open to them to prolong human life – and this at a time when death has become a social taboo. Betraying her special brand of empathy, documentarist Adéla Komrzý demonstrates that, while there’s no good or bad way to die, there’s always a means to improve patients’ quality of life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u02cUK9TCPedLtQS8t08FPa6mSx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20810,"logo_path":"/hBLCynl7e2l2w4Ro6SnS1a2FrME.png","name":"Nutprodukce","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":487,"logo_path":"/x3BUIowxU2skXOpnOeOkl7kIYDo.png","name":"Česká televize","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":32930,"logo_path":"/pk1mLuYxSmTWX0BdgzbHdUvRI5u.png","name":"FAMU","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":6104,"logo_path":"/dQTIRYC5DMz9N4lZpCOfJQzONlq.png","name":"Universal Production Partners","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2021-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Intensive Life Unit","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
