A thrilling, topical, and political documentary made to dispute the viewers’ need and wants for this type of true stories – a true Nordic noir, the first of its kind.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sOnWJHrDh5WABJsWvdLfnOdEnM2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2021-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Count","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
