The camera starts at a man eating caterpillars for the entire running time. The spectacle is so repulsive that the hand-held camera begins to shake wildly, Devensky himself admits that he had to look away during part of the filming. Thus the camera did the looking for him and for us. The experience is quintessentially voyeuristic, as even the filmmaker did not experience first hand what was going on.\" â€“Richard Koszarski, New York American","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1970-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Caterpillars and Ants","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
