The origin of many historical events can be traced back to repression, to loss, these events converge to form a catastrophe of such magnitude that the wounds never heal. A vicious circle is thus created, which contributes to the preservation of fear. The idea here is to construct a new context for the images; to imprint on the images a personal perspective by virtue of which they can be transposed to a subjective level. In this way, to raise the question of whether the events can be read from one's own perspective, from a different place.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2007-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Miedo/Fear","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
