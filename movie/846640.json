What makes people prone to irrational hate, and what steps can individuals and society take to eradicate it? In this program, psychology professors Susan Fiske, of Princeton University, and Mahzarin Banaji, of Harvard University; representatives of the Council on American-Islamic Relations and other pro-tolerance groups; and victims of prejudice share their insights and experiences. A pro-gay Baptist minister who formerly took a biblical stance against homosexuality and an exâ€“imperial wizard of the Ku Klux Klan who now speaks out for tolerance also offer their views. Contains inflammatory language and images.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5ZmasBC4hCJyN1q3Cr8HmvyxL8G.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Prejudice: More Than Black & White","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
