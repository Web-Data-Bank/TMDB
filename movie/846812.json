We look at things and the world differently than before, so that things don’t always repeat themselves, but get better instead: Two boys meet on a round trip with the Hamburg U3 line. Something evolves – not much but yet everything. The train runs through station after station. Lights changing on the outside and inside. Passengers and protagonists in the midst of noise & music. Glances, silence, a KitKat is broken, a Coke is being drunk. Outside: sunset & nightfall constantly interrupted by tunnels, platforms, posters & facades. The train passes the boarding station again. The timeline of love could be a circle. A common sensations music movie.","popularity":0.648,"poster_path":"/iOIm7ULcXxp1e3X9qK0i67D3kP8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2021-08-10","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"FIRST TIME [The Time for All but Sunset – VIOLET]","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
