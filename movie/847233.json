He visited Tunesia in 1914, together with August Macke. The light and colors there influenced him a lot. German documentary filmmaker Rüdiger Sünner travels through Egypt with Klee's diary in his luggage. This film essay shows Klee's paintings, sepia toned filmed sequences of early 1990s Egypt, and tells of old Egyptian myths (Osiris and his adventures in the underworld) from the Book of the Dead, stories that deeply inspired Paul Klee.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yiclXGGZwNCjhBKBK9VoaEbF8E7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31052,"logo_path":"/pJgQoO1PyJdhOP1UOrVsDeolYw7.png","name":"Deutsche Film- und Fernsehakademie Berlin (DFFB)","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1991-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die Legende vom Nil","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
