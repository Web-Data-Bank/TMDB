Until then her behaviour had been that of a typical macho male. This documentary shows her “transition” or gradual empowerment as a woman, a process that holds a certain promise of fulfilment. Alongside her friend, Fina, also a transsexual woman over 60 years old, they walk this path of light and shadow in their struggle to conquer the desired status of being a woman, as well as a degree of recognition on the part of society.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aNAKi2rm3wb9Np4V4g4CRddmpA6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Transition and Happiness","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":5}
