On the wall of the hut overlooking the valley, the words \"XX principle saves China\" have been obscured over the years. The director asks a girl what she thinks about the XX part, and the girl asks, \"Is there a need to save the country even though there is no war?\" An old man talks about his half-life for 85 years, while the girl continues to paint caricatures of old people in the village. The film records more than just the memories that disappear with the old people, the history and economic decline that remain as traces of the landscape. This small village is literally dyed in vibrant colors at the end of the harsh winter. \"Self-portrait: Born in 47KM\" (YIDFF 2017 NAC) directed by Zhang Mengqi.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zZ6rYBcHRcBtwqWQdnokltGCpDI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A small village in the mountains of China where the director continues to shoot for a long time.","title":"Self-Portrait: 47 KM's Window","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
