When Madge is expelled from boarding school for her practical jokes and pranks, she joins her mother and sister in Palm Beach, where they are wintering, in hopes of snaring a titled husband for Julia. Julia, fearful that her little sister will impair her success on the marriage market, forces Madge to dress as a child of ten. Julia has her sights set on the Earl of Larsdale, but after a series of misadventures, Madge elopes with the young man who turns out not to be an earl at all, but a prosperous young American who is holding her father's notes. Thus, she saves the day for the Flower family.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ohLb2jKAi0CL87JCVxFbAWUYNc6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":50574,"logo_path":null,"name":"New York Motion Picture","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1917-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Madcap Madge","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
