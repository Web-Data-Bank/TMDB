Hired to secure a declaration of marriage from South American millionaire Nicholas Fenwick, Corinne assumes the identity of a masked dancer to attract Fenwick's attention. Competing with Corinne for Fenwick's affections is Pansy Hartley, a woman who actually does have a shady past. After a series of misadventures, Fenwick falls in love with Corinne, whose parents, scandalized by their daughter's escapades, disown her. Reporting to her employers that Fenwick has proposed to her, Corinne discovers that the young man is not a millionaire, but rather the object of a publicity stunt, which is aborted when Corinne and Fenwick really do get married. Fenwick then approaches Corinne's parents and persuades them to forgive their daughter for her scandalous behavior.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4iCXXQ8uOvv4wczXvv8OdOI33lP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1307,"logo_path":"/z6FFp0gxKiB2KLS9n3fC8uX6ZcR.png","name":"Triangle Film Corporation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1917-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Indiscreet Corinne","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
