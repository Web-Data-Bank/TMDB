Thousands of people contribute to the success of the Badenfahrt in numerous clubs and pubs - a festival that unites the many volunteers for ten days and nights. Over a million people celebrated the last Badenfahrt. Some of the diverse people, whether asylum seekers or CEOs, who played an active role, are accompanied by this cinema documentary. Whether it's a handful of friends daringly building a pub on a steep slope, a young team turning night into day with a party club, or half a village aiming high with its rocket launching ramp: the countless helpers, who go their own ways in normal life, join forces to create something unique before, during and after the Badenfahrt. This feel-good movie is an emotional plea for diversity and for volunteerism in a country where associations are an important pillar of society.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/waV6OFnZXeOs8hJ6PFMyL87yXF8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":156855,"logo_path":null,"name":"REDSPACE","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"BADENFAHRT – FEST VEREINT","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
