The movie is based loosely on the life of Buster Keaton.","popularity":1.383,"poster_path":"/vjYGI1Ezf51Pq089setvW3Nr8gY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14959,"logo_path":null,"name":"Acre Enterprises","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1969-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A funny new motion picture that tells Hollywood like it was!","title":"The Comic","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":5}
