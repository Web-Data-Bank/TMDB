Interspersed with an amusing mockumentary, in which a kid tells the “history” of the Miraflores neighborhood, this short film is a tender and fresh portrayal of a potentially anonymous place in the suburbs, filling it with a beautiful and transformative affection. The first shots of an architecture with no personality show the contradictions of cities and their communities.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lEvtNU6xeNdTxtXd9ZHrGgih37j.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":85264,"logo_path":null,"name":"Curtas-Metragens, CRL","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2021-07-16","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Miraflores","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
