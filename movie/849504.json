Just as highly regarded in the theatre and in film, she's never been more captivating than in this live full-length concert DVD. She personalizes her memorable repertoire (from masters like Stephen Sondheim, Jacques Brel, Peter Allen, Andrew Lloyd Webber to newcomers whose names you'll want to remember) into remarkable mini-dramas of love and life... universal enough for all of us to relate to, yet individual enough to be hers alone.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/52WiFvSEj4WthtLPB03S7SasPkn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110098,"logo_path":"/t0IgZpMye1JEoJpp66KerBToqWt.png","name":"Maryland Public Television","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1987-04-22","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Karen Akers: On Stage at Wolf Trap","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
