Or is she merely a vessel into which the director can pour his idea of her?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xbhwwdXbsaxgOByjASg9xvk5KIO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thou’lt Look Back No More, Never, Never, Never, Never, Never","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
