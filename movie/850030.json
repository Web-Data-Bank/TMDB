The grammar of No Common Sentence is defiant, it is slow, it is repetitive, it is messy, and it ruptures conventions within cinematic language as it also retreats into a rhythmic tide pool of imagelessness.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fnqeMABfA8VfsgSzkNhfrdGZzRz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Common Sentence","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
