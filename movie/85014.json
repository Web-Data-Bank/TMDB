Even strange for him, this movie involves vampires, huge monster toads, and drunk monks. For some of the effects puppets were used, including a very creepy/realistic dummy version of the Drunk Monk. The fight scenes are very creative and show off Yuen Woo-ping's weird sense of style and choreography.","popularity":2.473,"poster_path":"/rOOuGV6yi7vsYp5IxhUNI3svW1s.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14104,"logo_path":null,"name":"First Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1983-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shaolin Drunkard","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":6}
