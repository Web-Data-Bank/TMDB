Those Left Waiting is a collaborative documentary that allows refugees in camps spread throughout distant corners of the world – from Africa and the Middle East to Asia and Europe – to take control of how their stories are told. Featuring footage of both the hardships and happiness in their daily lives, shot and streamed in real time, this one-of-a-kind project is as insightfully exploratory as it is expansive.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-08-20","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Those Left Waiting","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
