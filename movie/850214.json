Eye-catching, almost otherworldy and unashamedly provocative, this commentary on class, sexuality and urban stratification appropriates the pathologising label of ‘Other’ to shine a light on the explosion of ‘lifeforms’ in the Spanish capital today. Featuring the clever use of 8mm to create a surreal, pseudo-documentary look that draws in and distances simultaneously, Madrid, Bad Life is a sophisticated and thought-provoking high-concept work.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/y07JZSsvW3VPENhmdbyr8H4bLuA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Madrid, Bad Life","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
