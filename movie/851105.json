A distorted hearkening to the various 'lessons' of youth combines with inquiries surrounding learning, training and the mastery of a medium. The projectâ€™s length and pacing simulates that of a childhood music lesson: 40 minutes that feel like a lifetime.\r (The project title is a notation taken from banjo music tablature, denoting that a C chord is played with fingers on the 2nd, open, 1st and 3rd frets of the instrument).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"C2013","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
