Three stories intersect on a day of school in Pensacola, Florida. The film is a naturalistic portrayal of a class of teenagers in the slightly surreal Florida tourist town. It blends comedy with drama in a realistic manner. Shot on Super 16, the film feels like a memory of a hot summer day in Florida years ago.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xW2qpyFtL5ntcEVm7IJKiFJICao.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":157429,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dog Days Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wasted Hours","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
