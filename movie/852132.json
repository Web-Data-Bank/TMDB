A view of landscape is taken apart, to be reconstituted through memory. The grid, a reference to the “veil of threads” invented by Albrecht Dürer as an aid for perspective drawing – to transfer vision to a sheet of paper – is used for an opposite effect – to disperse a landscape across time. The viewer is asked to remember the space as it passes and reconstitute it from memory, actively connecting the image across space and time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lL36KPW4pvHVN2r9oZgoTs4Jqrf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tamalpais","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
