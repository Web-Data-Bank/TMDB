The very best from six theater programs will be collected and forged into a magnificent and classic theater evening. Includes intermission and show trap. It will be fun. For the gentlemen of Droog Brood – who have finally found a reason to perform precious scenes one more time (there is talk of itchy fingers) – but of course also for the audience, who will be presented with an evening of hilarious highlights and will be able to enjoy themselves immerse yourself in a warm atmosphere of sweet melancholy. In short: the ladyfingers have been bought, the Smurfs have been called and Soekeloekie has pulled his proverbial nose out of the grease to frequently put it around the corner.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fGPzPNSfn6amo4G0B9Z7yLVg4jJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Droog Brood: Toppers in de Mist","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
