Looking at her works, the programme uncovers the surprising stories behind how Julia's iconic characters were created and what they mean to a generation of readers. It also explores why Donaldson’s books appeal to both children and adults alike – tackling serious themes of love, loss, fear and bullying in a poignant but subtle way.","popularity":0.614,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A celebration of the life and work of Julia Donaldson and the remarkable cast of characters that have sprung from her imagination.","title":"The Gruffalo and Me: The Remarkable Julia Donaldson","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
