With the sun setting on the first full day, these Mancunian indie heroes are a magical choice.  Progressing from the sorrowful elegance of debut album Asleep In The Back to the life-affirming tunes of sixth release The Take Off and Landing of Everything, the Guy Garvey-led collective have picked up huge critical acclaim, including a Mercury Music Prize for The Seldom Seen Kid in 2008. They are regulars to Pilton, with Stuart Maconie describing their 2011 Pyramid stage set as 'career-defining.'  With the foot-stomping beats of Grounds For Divorce sitting harmoniously aside the heartbreaking My Sad Captains, you won't want to move a muscle throughout this spellbinding set.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Glastonbury 2014 Elbow","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
