In the 1980s an intrepid Australian pilot left behind a surfboard in the seaside village of Vanimo. Twenty years on, surfing is not only a pillar of village life but also a means to prestige. With no access to economic or educational advancement, let alone running water and power, village life is hermetic. A spot on the Papua New Guinea national surfing team is the way to see the wider world; the only way.","popularity":1.403,"poster_path":"/h1ARo5QMG3NfILj8Lb8OeKAWVpL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8507,"logo_path":null,"name":"In Effect Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2012-02-13","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Splinters","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
