Franklin Street in Richmond, Virginia home. The 6,500 square-foot warehouse was largely unoccupied by the small business, and over the years, it gained a following among musicians and artists seeking makeshift practice spaces to make noise and art.  In June 2016, the Garber Door Company relocated their business and sold the building on Franklin Street, displacing a large portion of the city's musicians and silencing a familiar Richmond sound forever.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/e16PxapFyGGNJix0YVtD6GKhGce.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Joyful Noise.","title":"Goodbye Garbers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
