The Warsaw guetto was first. Treblinka was created in a rural village near the Polish capital. 900.000 Jews and 500 Gypsies were murdered in 13 months. On August, 1943, the prisoners revolted and destroyed the camp. Only a few survived. Less than 10 worldwide remain today. Despite Treblinka tells the story of Mr. Rajchman, Mr. Wilenberg and Mr. Teigman. The movie follows the protagonists' paths in fairly chronological manner, from pre-war years, through Treblinka and the uprising, to the recent past and present, where a series of vignettes, often hilarious, show the possibility of living “despite” the horror.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3amU9f34SvyjxWlWsUGSOE0rDEl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":155231,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universidad ORT Uruguay","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2002-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Last Survivors","title":"Despite Treblinka","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
