He is famous for the novels starring the Jesus Kid, but his sales have been going from bad to worse for some time. The light at the end of the tunnel seems to be a film director's invitation: he wants Eugenio to write a film script. However, to write this script, Eugênio must spend three months isolated in a luxury hotel, without being able to go out or have contact with the world he knows. Based on this premise, Mutarelli builds a scathing critique of the publishing market and the film market — where he has been circulating for years. Bringing to Eugênio much of his own personality, the author shows how the commercial part of culture can be perverse to those who work in it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dc26J5BHKiDx4A8dQ5nzpQjZX0d.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":93196,"logo_path":"/jHeMJijdQAr64uwtvPqxEsT6KFV.png","name":"Grafo Audiovisual","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2022-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jesus Kid","video":false,"vote_average":2.5,"vote_count":1}
