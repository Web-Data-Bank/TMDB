Little do they know that amidst their tomfoolery, a bloodthirsty cult of territorial creatures has arisen from the shadows surrounding the cabin. It's up to Mike (Cole Stevenson) to save his girlfriend, Jamie (Laura Reinertson), his brother, Jeff (Nick Koscik), and his rag-tag team of friends from certain doom. The question is, can he rise to the challenge? It's a vacation straight from the depths of hell.
