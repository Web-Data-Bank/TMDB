Apparently also the Brandls, because now there is also from them a contribution to it. Whereby it concerns - as with the end time film typically - naturally not a world end per se. Our beautiful blue planet is preserved, only mankind is not. Except for a few exceptions. A deadly virus is the reason for the extinction of almost the entire world population. But not alone, because in the chaos of doom, to make matters worse, the machines also turn against their creators. Androids, which were actually created to support humanity and are used in almost all areas of society, now see Homo sapiens as a threat that must be destroyed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ivueDofQt2omsqLJTVgYC5s0YJh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21698,"logo_path":null,"name":"Brandl Pictures","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2020-07-27","revenue":0,"runtime":131,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Age of Genesis","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
