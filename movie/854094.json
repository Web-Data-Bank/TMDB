The screenwriter is unable to write an ending that is both compelling and fictitious - the happy ending that he had hoped for. Meanwhile, the director, who is insistent on upholding the truth, is as keen to end his film, as he is to help his friend, who is deeply affected by Sara's story. The film presents the different sides of Gaza, whose people are hurt by everyday issues as much as by death.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rEjTauxDx8akMoNTf4sms1gkWmA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-07-25","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sara","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
