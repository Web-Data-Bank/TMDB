Life goes on as the information code is stored in the gene chain. Every living being tries to indulge and laze. Unfortunately, development doesn't happen this way. The gene chain only rusts. Progress will only be made if there is an urgent need for it. The protagonist's rusty gene chain only starts working when the fear of death arises. What code is hidden in the human gene chain becomes clear during development. Mankind has debated the meaning of life for a long time, not knowing that it has long been found. What everyone is striving for is collectively creating strange patterns. After that, we become the starting point of a new gene chain again.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tmTQwyEUHQGO5JRDI9cn3u5Cuzi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":50470,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rao Heidmetsa Filmistuudio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"EE","name":"Estonia"}],"release_date":"2021-08-02","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Code","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
