We follow Jorge through a journey full of omens, where reality and magical thinking blend together, as he discovers that the myth of wealth is built on sacrifices that become ever more tangible – while the boundaries between victims and oppressors get progressively vague and blurred. Mother Lode is a fable about the banality of the descent to hell in times of neoliberalism; it is a paradigm of a relentless world in which everything can be sacrificed in the name of profit.","popularity":0.999,"poster_path":"/lgT8MyLblqZSDvGDV9MD4Qg13C4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":137482,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wendigo Films","origin_country":""},{"id":150784,"logo_path":null,"name":"Malfè film","origin_country":""},{"id":110043,"logo_path":null,"name":"C-Side Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2023-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mother Lode","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
