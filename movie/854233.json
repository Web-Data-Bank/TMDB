The entire spatial field of the film is activated by a technological nervous twitch, a bizarrely beautiful and hypnotic pulsing. The image shrinks, flows, collapses, seeming to follow some strange and hidden agenda. There is a text about speech on screen, visible through the pulse. In the background, extreme forms of vocalization, yodeling and macabre laughter punctuate the visual space. As the image flutters, a robotic voice speaks about various conditions of speech. Language is dislocated.It is unclear whether the voice mimics or generates the text.\" (Thomas Zummer)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5pAFxB4vEnPS9R54KZQnnWgartF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Have A Nice Day Alone","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
