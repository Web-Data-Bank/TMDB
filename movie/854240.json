Barely making a living as a nighttime security guard in Chicago, TJ wiles away his nights betting on football games, playing practical jokes, and smoking pot. Nothing seems to kickstart TJ’s life. That is until one night during a bitter winter storm. Trapped in a cold, desolate warehouse with an escaped serial killer known for mentally torturing his victims before decapitating them, TJ must do whatever it takes to survive.  A typical work night at the warehouse  abruptly turns into a bizarre game of cat and mouse. Suddenly TJ’s run-of-the-mill life careens off its track. Nothing is as it seems, and he finds himself trying to match wits with one of the wittiest serial killers around.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8bZtYZdo0BiChBJpTTt1CQVbrWk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"What Goes Around Comes Around","title":"Head Hunter","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
