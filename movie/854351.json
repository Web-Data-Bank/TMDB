So many images come to mind at the mere mention of this terrible virus, but one, above all, mercilessly describes those moments, symptomatic of a wound that will indelibly remain sealed in our collective consciousness—the coffins squeezed to capacity into military trucks in Bergamo. The whole area around the city of Bergamo was truly put to the test, there isn’t one family that wasn’t struck by the virus, the sound of ambulance sirens blared more than in any other city and the fear was so tangible that you could see it in the eyes of the inhabitants. However, this story is not about the hospital itself but about the people who promised, working day and night, that this miracle would come to pass. 7 days and, thanks to the Alpini, Bergamo can finally breathe again.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dvaQ0ZKI4Vp50eth7qSIq6P9N23.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":161204,"logo_path":null,"name":"Addictive Ideas","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":161205,"logo_path":null,"name":"Proger Smart Communication","origin_country":""},{"id":161206,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sive","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The 7 Days of Bergamo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
