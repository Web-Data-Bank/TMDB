His only difference is his wheelchair. He grew up with his mother, Nina. The arrival of Vincent, a new kid in school, will change a lot of things for Sam. He will make Sam realize the injustice surrounding him and his group of friends: Lila (with Asperger syndrome) and Tom (death). Together, they 'll create a gang to denounce the lack of consideration they endure every day. Far from feeling like victims, they hope to raise awareness by striking hard.","popularity":0.996,"poster_path":"/zfXso1T88eBtKOnB14ZchSLVoyv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Handigang","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":6}
