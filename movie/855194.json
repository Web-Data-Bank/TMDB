The reason why I chose a housing project as my subject is because I used to live in one and, even now, am strangely drawn to them. I also suspect that regardless of oneâ€™s nationality, the housing project is an archetypal environment universally recognizable to those of my generation. Without using spoken words, this film is a dedication to the housing project and those people of my generation all over the world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sONGpwR9P2E4m0O0yafg1z2M3It.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2003-06-04","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Frontier","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
