This is a question that has been puzzling mankind ever since Erich von Daniken popularized the Ancient Astronaut theory. Undeniably showing proof of aliens and high technology in ancient times von Daniken has shifted the perception of the God described in scripture to an extraterrestrial being. But is that really the case? Is “God” the creator of the universe or just an alien pretender using high technology to confuse mankind? Is there ancient scripture that would settle this argument and once and for all reveal not only the true identity of God but of the alien beings as well? And is von Daniken’s concept his own or are there dark powers at work?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qoWk7yAItE5K9gI2Y8bsvB3HWML.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"This movie reveals all the facts that von Daniken omitted.","title":"Ancient Aliens and Jesuits","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
