The Golden Angel, a Mexican masked wrestler, was recruited by the Americans in order to flush out the spies of the Third Reich and put a stop to their nefarious schemes. The Golden Angel’s assignments, still classified Top Secret and therefore absent from the history books, even brought him to a pivotal confrontation with Hitler himself.  Inspired by the spirit of classic mockumentaries such as Woody Allen’s ZELIG and Peter Jackson’s FORGOTTEN SILVER, the film takes viewers on a unique version of the fight against the Third Reich, joyfully erasing the border between fiction and reality for the viewers who, taken on this unique ride, can’t help but ask: did this really happen?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wrvRCcU0ECp7XyWM4VDnlmMtAhS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39676,"logo_path":"/iYkcRlXcDPzrO5xLTWFYxO2D2jU.png","name":"Forge Films","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":121393,"logo_path":null,"name":"Merlin Films","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2021-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Operation Luchador","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
