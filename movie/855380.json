Recreating Elder Pingree’s world from the late 1970s and early 1980s, the documentary moves from jungle village to coastal town to national capital, recounting the dramatic events, emotional highs and lows, and strict behavioral boundaries that defined his missionary experience. Elder Pingree walked hundreds of miles, visited scores of families, and eventually baptized into the Church roughly a hundred Guatemalans.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GT","name":"Guatemala"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Return of Elder Pingree - Memoir of a Departed Mormon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
