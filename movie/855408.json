Our protagonists were taken in as children by the plains, which – they say – once captivates you, keeps you forever. Through the intimate, honest interviews we get a glimpse of the part of their lives which usually remains hidden – as if peeping through the keyhole.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bIJPztXn25aaUVMuaKD3emjfDD1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hajszra és cselőre","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
