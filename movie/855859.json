Laila is an Afghan girl. They've met for a brief second and from that moment their destinies became intertwined. This film, finding itself on the border between documentary and fiction, tells the stories of a soldier marked by the brutality of war and that of a young girl who had been in the wrong place, in the wrong time. The director combines archival footage from the war in Afghanistan with beautifully shot personal images, in a film about the cruelty of war, from the perspective of both the invaders and of the civilians trapped within.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nx4KCaFCiP6IKvVh0Z2g9TW3Ue5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2021-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Same Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
