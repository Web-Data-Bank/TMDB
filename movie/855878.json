Juxtaposed alongside this footage is an audio voiceover read by a survivor of the 1992 – 1995 Sarajevo siege in Bosnia. They describe their city in lockdown, day to day life, their challenges, thoughts, fears and their hopes. The voiceover could easily be that of a Glaswegian in Spring 2020.   There are striking similarities between this wartime siege and the lockdown experienced in Glasgow. Just as in Sarajevo, our freedom of movement was very limited – we couldn't travel, go to pubs and restaurants, children couldn't go to school.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zatvaranje","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
