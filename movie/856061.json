Moni's StageOrchestra is inspired by that music, by its constant change of tones and by the spirit which pervades it, from the sorrowful, monochord which revives the spirit of a synagogue prayer to the explosive joy of songs and dance music created for happier occasions. It is not a faithful reprise of klezmer music or a philological revisitation we propose here, but rather a free use, which maintains the climate and the imprint of several centuries of musical practice, born and developed in close proximity with the Polish, Czech and Byelorussian civilizations and enriched by a fertile exchange with the musical culture of that other diasporic population of Europe, the Gypsy people.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Yiddish","iso_639_1":"yi","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oylem Goylem","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
