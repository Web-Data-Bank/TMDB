What emerges is how diverse the Uruguayan left was in thought and action in fields like attitudes to armed struggle, the place of women and children, the historical significance of the Frente Amplio Party and the ways in which the old ideals have found expression - or not, as the case may be - under the first left wing national government in the history of the country. The documentary was made for Casa Bertolt Brecht, and is geared to stimulating debate and training new generations of activists.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wExWa2vR7hL8s5kkxI90i9nfghZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":158298,"logo_path":null,"name":"Casa Bertolt Brecht","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stories of Activists","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
