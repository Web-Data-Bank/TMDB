Its style is very power metal-focused, but the band's music is also influenced by more traditional heavy metal and hard rock. In Finland and other Nordic countries, the band's record company is Helsinki Music Company and elsewhere in Europe the German GUN Records. The band has received attention thanks to their young age: when the first album was released, Sturm und Drang's members Alexander Ivars, Henkka Kurkiala, Andre Linman, Calle Fahllund and Jeppe Welroos were 15-16 years old.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sXf8srohXbf7bilshmywcr7r1kI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":127147,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sveng.com Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Making Sturm und Drang","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
