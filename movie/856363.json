The Mizrahim, as their are called, were denied their right to a better life and forced to move to development towns in the Negev Desert. Today, the new generations of Mizrahim still suffer from this policy conducted 70 years ago. Michale Boganim follows the footsteps of her father, who came from Morocco and quickly became a leader of the local Israeli Black Panthers to stand against this discrimination. She embarks on a road trip through Israël's history to meet with three generation of Mizrahims.","popularity":0.704,"poster_path":"/tSgm3slTv0ciE5Gtf6UcHunzRWD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":207,"logo_path":"/uskenzq65wJe0cT0D8StQI3hJnO.png","name":"Agat Films \u0026 Cie / Ex Nihilo","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":152655,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reservoir Docs","origin_country":""},{"id":15,"logo_path":"/2GukAxjXAF3Qf4GosI6WzIgljL3.png","name":"Lama Films","origin_country":"PS"},{"id":160367,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bonne Nouvelle Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":49104,"logo_path":"/ltAXIxwQQcAY5uc864bxPN14oph.png","name":"Studio Orlando","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":310,"logo_path":"/4Gp5A4YdjPBfsHT47ngHMaXWmb9.png","name":"CNC","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2022-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"From the Promised Land to Oblivion","title":"The Forgotten Ones","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
