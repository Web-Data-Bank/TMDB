One day she finds herself homeless and begins, in her own crazy way, to seek shelter and her own place in the world. Between an illusory desire for motherhood and ways to make ends meet, she spends the hottest days of a torrid Roman summer surrounded by elusive characters with empty lives, yet pure and wonderful like her. In a limbo made up of nothing (and everything), Giulia understands that it is up to her to decide how to live, or not to live, her own life.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/kxs0Stf3q22W18FkJ2ezC5NasnD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121146,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fondazione Fare Cinema","origin_country":""},{"id":160716,"logo_path":null,"name":"Coccinelle Film Sales","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2022-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Giulia","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":9}
