Two different approaches, two characters, two views that only seem antithetical meet and then open up in front of a camera. Or, more precisely, in front of the cameras. On the one hand, the eye of Daniele Segre. On the other hand, Tonino's, which almost taints the film's aesthetics. The film's development conveys a sense of immediacy, which is a fundamental principle for both directors. Daniele films Tonino and Tonino films Daniele, and this takes place in a play of associations, and in the space of an encounter. The two directors have seized this opportunity to swap views and experiences.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vrc5YIUXM5msZB4uov53ibXnjr5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160840,"logo_path":null,"name":"I Cammelli","origin_country":""},{"id":26261,"logo_path":"/thn5VXJ5JegdrtiJn7mFuV2NWB6.png","name":"Film Commission Torino Piemonte","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2021-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tonino De Bernardi: One Time, One Encounter","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
