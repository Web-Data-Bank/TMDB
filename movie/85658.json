He's a California importer who, as a youth, lived in Asia for years and took tea with the Dali Lama. Hoffman's mission is to find and bring to the U.S. the best hand picked and hand processed tea. This search takes him directly to farms and engages him with Chinese scientists, business people, and government officials: Hoffman wants tea grown organically without a factory, high-yield mentality. By 2004, Hoffman has seen success: there are farmer's collectives selling tea, ways to export \"boutique tea\" from China, and a growing Chinese appreciation for organic farming's best friend, the earthworm.","popularity":0.872,"poster_path":"/yYdoAXmDiI5hrgLXwOFhC7U2U40.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All In This Tea","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
