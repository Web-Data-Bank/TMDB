Calling themselves ‘ghosts’, they left their homeland for a foreign country whose language they cannot speak, work towards an uncertain future, and hide like phantoms to evade the authorities. The film observes the situation of these workers, as well as visits the other generation of Thai migrant worker in South Korea, an 80 year-old Thai veteran who once fought a Korean war.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/AuPUUNOe0CHs5l4qOgyDbkyspeX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"},{"iso_3166_1":"TH","name":"Thailand"}],"release_date":"2017-07-05","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Thai","iso_639_1":"th","name":"ภาษาไทย"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wandering Ghosts","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
