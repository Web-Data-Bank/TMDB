It sits on the border between Uruguay and Brazil, but it is on an imaginary line as this is a dry border as there is no river or stream to mark the boundary. We meet the characters, we watch their activities and we are introduced to their customs.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/DUQJJm8cG58FX2CfE8deUX44Mn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Imaginary Line","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
