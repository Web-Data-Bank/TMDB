With archive images and music from the period, this documentary pays homage to those years and to a time gone by. There is testimony from Batlle's personal hairdresser, his master of arms, his children and travelling companions in politics, and his adversaries. We witness his meeting with General Juan Domingo Perón, and we see the Graf Zeppelin with its swastika in the sky above Montevideo.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xDJrhkD1vIR9glgBLrGRniX8DJE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":158281,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinemateca Uruguaya","origin_country":""},{"id":158478,"logo_path":null,"name":"Presidencia de la República (Uy)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"1999-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Luis Batlle Berres","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
