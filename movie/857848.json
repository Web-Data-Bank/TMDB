In 1986 the train station was closed down and the community was in danger of disappearing altogether, but today it is still there and in fact it is growing. The local samba “schools”, which are similar to these organizations in Brazil except that they speak Spanish, tell the story of the town and its outstanding figures against a background of local and more universal events. The documentary shows how carnival is celebrated in this Uruguayan border town.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A5vrCuRi4sVnI0tS7IBy6bMfAIX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":143782,"logo_path":null,"name":"L'Avventura Cine","origin_country":""},{"id":2358,"logo_path":null,"name":"Laroux-Ciné","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Carnaval in Baltasar Brum","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
