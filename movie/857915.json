Its happenings won't splash across the front page of your morning newspaper, but the daily affairs of this little neighborhood are the main headlines to the people that live here. Their source for these stories is Bill, a wheelchair bound man with paraplegia who devotes his time and ambition to seek out those local chronicles that his neighbors so desire. But with Bill's responsibility to entertain comes certain jealousy from Igor, who thinks he's better suited for the job. And from Doug, who just craves the respect it brings. Today, dressed with a shirt he found in the free-box, and with hope in his heart, Doug sets out to gain that respect.","popularity":0.886,"poster_path":"/k817hWdWfVsxCgWJ754ZIqGHW3Y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":41981,"logo_path":null,"name":"Awkward Moment Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":73162,"logo_path":null,"name":"Greendale Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":158494,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sweet Remembrance Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Their lives are an open book... but who gets to be the author?","title":"False Creek Stories","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
