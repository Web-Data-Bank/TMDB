She pays for her strivings with a loss of faith in values. With nothing to lose, Ania invents a daredevil game, supposed to provoke the group and especially its leader-Czarny, to think. The surprising end of the film gives a new chance to return to normality for its characters. The film is based on the short story 'Moc słowa' [The Power of Word] by Anna Czajka and corresponds to the second Commandment: 'You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain'.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/czvB15qmLAOWEpplHmFc4UyHypZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71131,"logo_path":null,"name":"Absolut Media","origin_country":""},{"id":158501,"logo_path":null,"name":"Harpoon Films","origin_country":""},{"id":6480,"logo_path":"/qJUUNzFYXNUDaisssBTV3Zdki9R.png","name":"TVP","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2009-09-14","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Newbie","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
