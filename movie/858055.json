Mandiyú is a group of small milk producers who are landless. In 2007 they finally ran out of patience waiting for an official ruling about a plot of land, and as there was no response from the Institute of Colonisation they occupied an unproductive space belonging to the Uruguayan state. This documentary tells the story of these workers and their families.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qzsNW0hrQl9XKL4wmL5CjsDKP8L.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":158523,"logo_path":null,"name":"Siete Pueblos","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mandiyú","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
