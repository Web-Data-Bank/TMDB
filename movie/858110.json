Take a clear plastic body-length lightweight bag for instance: it can be worn to maintain body warmth (staving off hypothermia), strung between two trees to create a tube tent shelter, or wrapped around the branch of a deciduous tree to produce water. Ward teaches viewers how to build a fire (even one-handed), set up various shelters, make a slingshot with medical tubing (also handy for a tourniquet), and signal for help.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dbNCPAreZ7lsIkZ0cPYtnn8DEyk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Survival Beyond The 10 Essentials","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
