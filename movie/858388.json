When tragedy strikes, the couple find themselves trapped in a near-ghost town whose past secrets begin to bubble back up to the surface. A spine-tingling thriller set way, way out of the city, Fortin’s splendidly crafted first feature, anchored in the Innu community of Matimekush, ventures into an isolated region to set the stage for an authentic encounter between the quintessential city slicker and nature.","popularity":0.915,"poster_path":"/nCLEjBYM7QthDl7n5fmsiAiXpVZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88623,"logo_path":"/yuGgqKQz3mVgqLn4nokSGcmeAUA.png","name":"Voyelles Films","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2022-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nouveau-Québec","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
