Before the Cubans were thrown out of Cuba, so town still cracker white for the most part. And the UM campus art buildings play some role. Also Miami Beach, Coral Gables, South Miami, Homestead, and the Everglades too. The inspiration was seeing the incredible Super8mm 8-screen diary cinema made by German-American photographer Will McBride, who several years earlier had visited the Wilson Hicks Communications Conference at UM. He somehow got Leica to donate the cameras and projectors and filmed everything at his hippie-artists-commune in Italy. Music track by a variety of persons; last performed and edited by Joel Haertling of Architect’s Office from several live performances in Boulder. He worked on most of Brakhage’s later sound films in the 80s-90s period.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-08-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"AO804.1","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
