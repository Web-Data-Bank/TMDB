One morning, she stumbles upon a show called \"Living the perfect life\". The ideal pitched by the TV host is far away from Anna's own existence and it makes her feel like an outsider. To escape her frustration, she dives into her imaginary world, until a call from her funny and intellectual friend Jean, distracts her from her thoughts. Jean challenges her to face the real world and observe things from a different perspective. The dialogue between them brings back Anna's memories from the past and makes her relive all the feelings that have shaped her journey.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wMXjRfEaGfzBcLu9VpV2Xwm9odm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":158622,"logo_path":null,"name":"Coxy Agency","origin_country":""},{"id":158623,"logo_path":null,"name":"Omada Cinema","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Imperfect Picture","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
