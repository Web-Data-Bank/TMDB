Unsurprisingly for them, there is more that divides them than unites them. The old friends represent different world views, social, religious and civilizational attitudes of the modern world. The culture war going on in the world today has also reached them. Just when there finally seems to be a chance for common language across the divide, something happens that further exacerbates the conflict.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hB8zvzCwZUrBnCGPka8GiZQgPMO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2021-08-06","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Head Shot","video":false,"vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":4}
