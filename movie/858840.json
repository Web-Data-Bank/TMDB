The most revealing documentary ever produced about the 10 year hunt for Osama Bin Laden by the Central Intelligence Agency. We interview former Directors, CIA case officers, military leaders, members of European intelligence services, and US Congressman who played direct roles in the hunt and elimination of the world's #1 terrorist. Many of the people most deeply involved with the hunt and killing of Bin Laden have been reluctant to share their stories until now. There was simply no benefit for these quiet professionals, their families, or the agencies they served to be in the public eye. But they have collectively decided that now is the time - to go on record and tell their stories before it's too late. As far as possible, we will permit testimonies of those who dealt directly with the ex-Al Qaeda leader. His family, his lieutenants, his fighters.","popularity":0.661,"poster_path":"/y5qSG8QklHeXLkENM4UtjvyxVIF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"CIA vs. Bin Laden: First In","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
