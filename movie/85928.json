The stables are located right in an airfield, and the sound of airplanes droning around only fuels his lust to fly. \"I want to fly like the birds!\" declares the woodpecker. But the only thing the bulldog sergeant on the airfield feels Woody is competent for is clipping the horses with an electric clipper. And considering that Woody accidentally allows the clipper to clip off the sarge's shirt buttons and a long strip of hair off his chin, he may be giving Woody too much credit. Nevertheless, Woody spends his time reading \"How to Fly a Plane from the Ground Up.\" And eventually, he sneaks onto a PU-2.","popularity":1.041,"poster_path":"/96AGlqi5IUcf12fHxfVNReEVXyU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8520,"logo_path":null,"name":"Walter Lantz Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":33,"logo_path":"/8lvHyhjr8oUKOOy2dKXoALWKdp0.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1942-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ace in the Hole","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":11}
