Richard Sammut Petri, a young father, is inducted into a shady organisation by his friend Roger Tabone and convinced to assassinate the Prime Minister of Malta.  2012, Noel Sammut Petri returns to Malta for his mother’s funeral, still haunted by the memories of his father Richard, who abandoned his family back in 1984. Slowly, Noel is pulled in by the old family friend Roger and his family, but the closer he gets, the more history starts to haunt his life and he becomes destined to fall in the same pit of snakes that took down his father.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3dR4TqsVcfeguTL5YIdfpVLWvEP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Maltese","iso_639_1":"mt","name":"Malti"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The truth cuts both ways.","title":"A Vipers' Pit","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
