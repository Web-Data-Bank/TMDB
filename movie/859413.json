I ended up with a sort of travelogue consisting of ten sections edited in the order in which they were shot, beginning in spring and ending in winter. Some of the footage documents my travels over that time period, some documents travelers visiting places I called home at the time of filming. Additionally, some of the footage is made with actors playing travelers for the camera. Towards the end of the edit I decided to throw in some older footage I had in order to round out the picture. Originally a silent film, I have added a soundtrack mix by Sean Byrne of Bugskull.\" -SD","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fsET3rI1yYNn3XYY6pIPSgZIvBQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Circuit","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
