They seek to build a shelter where they can escape from family abandonment, neighbor´s cruelty, and the constant stalking by the police. In a seemingly desolate neighborhood, with factory sounds and rusty walls, the four teenagers are constantly observed by people around them. Inhabit narrates the transitory, the impossibility of building and creating a sense of belonging in a hostile place with a marginalizing environment.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xlta4nXot8uiKMpTEyzaSzgcBdQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"},{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2021-08-18","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lo habitado","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
