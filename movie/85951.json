Jesse is a 16-year-old who is trying to put his life back together after the death of his father, who died while trying to rescue him in the wilderness. Jesse goes to live with his Uncle Roy, who lives in the rugged mountains of Washington State. While exploring, Jesse finds and rescues a wolf who has been seriously wounded; Jesse bonds with the animal, and while Roy understands the dangers of trying to tend to a wild animal, reluctantly allows Jesse to keep him. Jesse, who is fond of snowboarding, teaches the wolf to be his partner in skijoring, a sport in which a dog is used to haul a man on skis. John Rockwell the owner of a ranch, has different plans for the animal; he sees the wolf as a threat to his stock and is determined to see that the animal is put down.","popularity":3.53,"poster_path":"/zSDT6UzAHLbmJe5VErvyfaERFJs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":148731,"logo_path":null,"name":"A Boy and His Wolf Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":148732,"logo_path":null,"name":"Silver Wolf Films","origin_country":""},{"id":4369,"logo_path":"/9IOys9AslGUqSDk7SJhWkdEgTlX.png","name":"Legacy Filmworks","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Wolf and a Snowboarder team up for the ride of theirs lives.","title":"Silver Wolf","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":11}
