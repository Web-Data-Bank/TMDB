A box office hit in \"orphan island\" Shanghai, occupied Nanking, and colonial Singapore, the film was literally burned in the streets of Chungking (Chongqing) by agitators who considered the filmmakers to be traitors--notwithstanding the film's allegory of resistance against invaders. The commercial success of this film helped to usher in the age of the wartime costume drama.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hua Mu Lan 木蘭從軍","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
