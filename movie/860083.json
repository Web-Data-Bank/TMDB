In the finale, replicating the Stalinist show trials of the 1950s, the audience applauds the death sentences for two defendants, and long prison terms for the other two who absurdly also lose their voting rights. The ice cold Poshnja is a rarely-screened, forbidden film (it is not even listed on the Albanian archive website) and the sole directing effort of Albania’s leading film scholar, Abaz Hoxha.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oSTfAZC6BpnX5xW7KfirUECtPaG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AL","name":"Albania"}],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Albanian","iso_639_1":"sq","name":"shqip"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trial Against the Declassed from Poshnja, Berat January 6-7, 1978","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
