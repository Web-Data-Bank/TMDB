Time and motion has been sculpted in graphic black and white on the two-dimensional screen. Time and motion are fundamental dimensions for film as an art form. A pendulum movement, subjectively illustrating a measured length of time. Shadows, contrasts and abstracted light sources, further elaborated. Metro is based on impressions of Chatelet Metro station in Paris. It is individualistic and subtle portrayal of an atmosphere and setting as seen through the linguistic syntax of the film strip.
