Through the series of informal interviews and the personal narration, which are recorded either in Alica’s apartment or in assorted nearby locations, we feel ever closer to Alica, as if we were sitting with her at the same table and listening to her opinion on a variety of issues relating to the Roma minority in the Czech Republic, including segregation at primary school, negative prejudices and even racist preconceptions towards Romani people in everyday life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":158869,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mediálny Hlas","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alica","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
