Just like rivers that move water around on the land, atmospheric rivers—never visible to the naked eye—were a vital force in shaping the colonization of the American West. Today, the evolving scientific and cultural understandings of atmospheric rivers exemplify the complexity and importance of the stories we tell ourselves about science, climate, and the natural world. This film was created at the Days and Nights Festival held at the Philip Glass Center for the Arts, Science, and the Environment.","popularity":0.654,"poster_path":"/jjWjTeh26cQ5AwyTIxFiXl7pO0v.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107610,"logo_path":"/qAKVsJbX6PUcmpJeqUZYT9lwRQV.png","name":"Honest Engine Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-08-11","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An experimental history of atmospheric rivers","title":"War and the Weather","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
