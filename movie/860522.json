Not quite. Something in her was reluctant to accept and suffer in silence. Why did the sign of what all societies consider a blessing -- women's ability to give birth -- happen to be described with names and expressions like \"the curse\" (in England), the \"English war debarquement\" (in France), and \"to be on the rags\" (in the U.S.)?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Menstruation, Culture & the Politics of Gender","title":"Red Moon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
