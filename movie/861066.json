She took her two children with her to California to meet a stranger, a man who would soon become her husband and father to her children. The film brings together the audition process, behind- the-scenes footage, archival home movies, scripted scenes, and an interview with the director's mother, Svetlana. This project is an immersive form of visual storytelling that employs memory and performance in equal measure to show the journey of immigrating to America.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fWSMjrZBX3x3Y9gUVjz2vErkynI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Santa Barbara","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
