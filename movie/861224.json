The piece and lyrics itself have become a starting point for the final artwork: a study of borderlines between the mechanisms of recognition and non-recognition where abstractions are being intertwined with concrete images, and personal memories are being blended with the thoughts of the global. The film contains footages from the director's personal family archive, as well as sequences created with some experimental video and animation techniques. Thus, the \"private\" forms the \"poetic\", weaving the fabric of the film's narrative.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Revolution 0","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
