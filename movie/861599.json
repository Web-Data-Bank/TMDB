George Armstrong Custer and over 200 of his soldiers were wiped out by Plains Indians on June 25, 1876, but is it possible that one man, alone, lived to tell the tale? How did he survive? Why did he never come forward? And most important of all, is it true? The amazing tale of Frank Finkel is an epic story of struggle, perseverance, and survival and will shed new light on this historic moment.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ef87MESqBqsaXvgi4V3LrqvbaWv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Custer's Last Man: I Survived Little Big Horn","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
