In a conversation both intimate and sweeping in scope, Hall describes his migration from Jamaica to England, his immersion in left-wing politics in London, the influence of Raymond Williams and E.P. Thompson on the evolution of his thought, and the context within which the early classic texts of cultural studies were written. Hall also shares his pessimism about the economic recession and his optimism about Barack Obama's victory. Future analysis of Hall's work, and of cultural studies in general, will need to take account of this fascinating and indispensable first-person account of his life and ideas.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hJGgIlaVjlb2hsnFuXpFntip6il.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":258,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Personally Speaking: A Long Conversation with Stuart Hall","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
