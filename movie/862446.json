The main line gives but a small idea of the film, of its erotic style, its choreographic dimension, its strange fragmentation. The film drifts along an ever-renewed invention, intertwining lavish dances, mask games, musical comedy, parodies, permanent repression of the body offering itself as an object of desire to the viewer who is literally seduced.â€™","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/e7CCF6hjjvGnKE83vZ0q1w1hItB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Further and Particular","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
