Many patients thus became isolated, unable to receive any medical care. A native of the Orchid Island (Lanyu) where she worked as a nurse, the filmmaker initiated a program in 1997, recruiting some 40 volunteers to visit and care for homebound elderly patients against considerable social pressure. This documentary captures the powerful dilemma when traditional values clash with compassion.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/h9DC74NF58xFyeVs14xOIsGr8hq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"And Deliver Us from Evil","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
