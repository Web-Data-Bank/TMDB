Sometimes the images appear in an abstracted version of color negative film, a mix of pale pinks and blacks, but more often her colors are relatively natural. Her superimpositions do not take the form of multiple exposures like Lebrat's, in which the light of each layer adds to the others and overall the image grow brighter. Instead she runs her film through the last so that dark areas in another : light is lost rather than gained.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1977-05-09","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bruine Squamma 2ème partie : Séries Brutes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
