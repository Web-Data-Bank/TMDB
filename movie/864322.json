However, when the human settlements rolled in, what awaited them was neither discovery nor pioneering but colonization and war against the planet's original inhabitants. With an increasingly militaristic government that demands the settlers' sacrifice for the good of all, one family is torn apart when the eldest daughter, Ara, questions who the real bad guys are. At a time where mass think seems to be the safest option, Ripple Effect asks us if we're brave enough to go against the grain, and at what cost?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iZIukqdaB7rZc7EC6LAAlvTOkYY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ripple Effect","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
