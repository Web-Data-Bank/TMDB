Huck is a resourceful and spirited lad who knows how to survive on his own. He flees his father, and travels with Jim, a runaway, from whom he learns about life.  Tom Sawyer is a mischievous, adventure-hungry boy who has a zest for life. He is a true romantic at heart, but not above a little trickery to get his way... or to get out of work.  Tom's life really becomes interesting when he meets Huck. Together with Jim, they begin a series of adventures. Based on the novels by Mark Twain, \"Huck and Tom's Mississippi Adventures\" stands as a timeless story filled with excitement, action, and universal lessons that appeal to all ages.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yK9tEmQBfd3M34PPVbEmk1L2Rao.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":45723,"logo_path":"/4kkwgMhlfhxb9HigINcHFcT49Ny.png","name":"Enoki Films","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":54157,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aubec","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Huck & Tom's Mississippi Adventure","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
