Picking the viewer from the beginning to get introduced to the background story by evolving a continuous raising tension. Ariane's visa gets declined, and even with a 90-day permit to stay, she gets refused to enter New Zealand. Tin is at that time already in Christchurch with a bought camper. They figure the only possible solution is to change the entire plan to South America. After a two-year long-distance relationship, the couple is facing again incredibly difficult situations. Several local confrontations and a broken car strengthens their bond and accelerates the year in the wild into an immersive experience. Passing the small ridge between a nature-travel documentary and a story which lets your blood run cold, White Spot makes you wanna break out of the system and travel the world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rbAjTjl5sVYvrgJO7K7Tt2iSYWz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":122,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"White Spot","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
