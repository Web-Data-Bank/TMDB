With traffic on the road functioning as the drone, \"On the Road Going Through\" creates a meditative, impressionistic view of a composite small town in Iowa. While actually shot in many towns, the tape implies a unified single town that is, after all, consistent with the subjects shared concerns. The people talk about kids, dogs, traffic and storms as traffic repeatedly passes by in the background.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On the Road Going Through","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
