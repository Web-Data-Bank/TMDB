He harbors a secret love for one of his young students, Fran, whom he loses touch with after her graduation. Some time later, Miereveld has to attend an autopsy, and the shock of the experience deeply affects his mental balance. He finds out - or he believes so - that Fran has become a popular singer. He arranges to meet her to finally reveal his feelings. An ambiguous but perhaps tragic denouement follows which might be a figment of the protagonist's disturbed mind.","popularity":2.422,"poster_path":"/4qMYOTz9aKfC0EQgSMKN963MSf2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11619,"logo_path":"/lpjHtqZkBZflKjCe33nHXKF7YNV.png","name":"Belgische Radio en Televisie","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":11621,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ministerie van Nationale Opvoeding en Kultuur","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"1966-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Man Who Had His Hair Cut Short","video":false,"vote_average":6.833,"vote_count":27}
