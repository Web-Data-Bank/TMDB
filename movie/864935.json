In the enchanting atmosphere of the backstage, it is highlighted: what roles were played on the stage, and what in life, who is to blame for this and how to forgive? After all, life is the same theater, only without rehearsals and repetitions. But the sworn diva girlfriends have yet to face the trials of the new reality. Legends of the theater, artists of a wonderful, but passing century, will meet contemporary art “not for everyone” and will try to figure out what to do for all of us, the rest. Who will win: loyalty to the old theater or the modern \"version of the theater\" - formalism from a young shocking amateur director, on whose side his father is an official.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lYaPbP0olWJxa2QOOIeakv4Z74Y.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":159608,"logo_path":null,"name":"Andrey Noskov Creative Center","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2021-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Am a Clown","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
