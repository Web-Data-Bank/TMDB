That man, Franklin Page, has long since moved on - to a wife, two children, and a reliable job in a reliably safe and quiet rural town. The stability Franklin worked so hard to establish is soon threatened, and the violence he believed he'd left behind in the war begins to re-emerge and cloud over both the household and the town itself.","popularity":1.734,"poster_path":"/rSoM0cGoo4rbcJYNXBMJ0kwndLr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11065,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Film Works","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2011-02-04","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oliver Sherman","video":false,"vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":6}
