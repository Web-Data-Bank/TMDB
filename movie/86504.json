BRUTES AND SAVAGES is the filmed document of his death-defying adventures. Shocking, brutal and repulsive, this film mixes bizarre authentic footage with incredibly exploitive (and often hilarious) \"re-enactments\" of his findings. Animal sacrifices, bizarre tribal ceremonies, mating rituals and even brain surgery.","popularity":0.782,"poster_path":"/eoVLw5txhhBJXoZnrCuWISBlwse.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1978-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In Fantastic Brute Sound!!","title":"Brutes and Savages","video":false,"vote_average":3.8,"vote_count":6}
