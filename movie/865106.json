I was inspired to make this film against the backdrop of the pandemic and the growing criticisms of Canada’s response to keeping the elderly safe during this time. With an ageing population in various states of mental deterioration, many tragically didn’t fully grasp why family had stopped visiting during the pandemic. Drawn using traditional and digital media, Forgotten presents and explores one person’s loneliness, sorrow, and deteriorating grip on reality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7WFVBt4hg64gj94GOAlveUT4Cze.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2021-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Forgotten","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
