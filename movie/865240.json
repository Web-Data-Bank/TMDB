For the first half hour or so it's all heavy melodrama about a guy seeking revenge for his dead father and his mom's disappointment with him for not getting it and generally for being such a loser. When we finally get to some fighting there are some weird choices including one of the end fight scenes being just a series of stills shown over some music.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/tX1Jcfqcyu6fziGqI2pmihMwMuK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1977-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A righteous sad story full of actions","title":"Triumph Of Two Kung-Fu Arts","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
