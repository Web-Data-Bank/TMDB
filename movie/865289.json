This album contains tracks spanning across the Pop, Hip Hop and Jazz genres, including the lead single 'I'm All Over It', an outstanding take on Rihanna's 'Don't Stop The Music' and the spectacular ballad 'Love Ain't Gonna Let You Down' as well as many more. Cullum mixes Jazz with melodic Pop and Rock into a crossover style that calls to mind such artists as Harry Connick, Jr., and Norah Jones. In that vein, Cullum will just as often cover a swinging Jazz standard as a modern Rock song, and his original compositions deftly move from earnest ballads to songs of sardonic wit.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vadWBoQUDfmCmMO1ZrB5BMzb44.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jamie Cullum - The Pursuit","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
