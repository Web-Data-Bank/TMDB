The dramatic real story of a Italian princess, born and raised in the comforts of a golden court, who will be forced by war to share the fate of ordinary people in a concentration camp. Mafalda di Savoia was chosen to represent the decline of nobility and the errors of war, which separate and destroy even noble families. Mafalda is a victim of political strategies that overlook her, and her tragic death shows the levelling power of war, that forces poor and rich alike to share the same destiny.","popularity":1.989,"poster_path":"/qp5BWgcfYPqRZJlk2Hi44vMvtFo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-11-28","revenue":0,"runtime":180,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mafalda of Savoy","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
