Bears and wolves still roam its inaccessible forests, in its remote villages people still live in harmony with nature - many things appear as in times long past for us. Romania is still home to animals and traditions that have long been lost in other regions: marmots inhabit the high meadows of the Carpathian Mountains, where shepherds graze their sheep in summer. Colorful bee-eaters live in Transylvania and pelicans fish in the Black Sea. With impressive images, this high-quality nature documentation takes you to surprisingly unknown, wild Romania.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kRvGGcIjMW3YUKMEpjD1rbcRKBm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18407,"logo_path":"/cI9BOAZbURxD8hrbtbB4ncwZzox.png","name":"NDR Naturfilm","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2009-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wild Romania - Land of Bears and Wolves","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
