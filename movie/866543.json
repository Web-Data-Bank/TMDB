By knocking on strangers doors and asking them this question: 'If you had a magic goldfish that granted you three wishes, what of this goldfish would you wish?' Yoni thinks he will discover the hopes, dreams and greatest wishes his fellow citizens. But Yoni is not prepared when he meets an elderly immigrant named Sergei who we learn has been wrestling with the exact same question for years and is desperate not to lose his old friend-- a beautiful talking goldfish (Lucy Punch).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/l32Fg1J1CR3S3Smb3yHBKtsvUKE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Goldfish","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
