Their goal was to make a movie about a young actress struggling to make her dreams come true. . For eleven days, these filmmakers roamed across deserts, canyons, salt flats and snowy mountains. Their script was little more than a rough outline, so they carried on down the road, stopping to shoot a scene whenever they felt the magic of a particular location. Road to Sundance is a surreal and imperfect film, a project born of passion and instinct that celebrates the power of following our dreams.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Road to Sundance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
