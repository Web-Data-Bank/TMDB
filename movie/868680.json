Even now it is a vibrant city there is a shopping complex where the Nishinomiya baseball park once stood, and the Hyogo Arts and Culture Center was established which even holds live performances of opera. The Kitaguchi Market which stood on the North East side of Nishinomiya KItaguchi Station was disrupted in the Kobe Earthquake and has all but changed. The development of the city continues and the landscape has changed but the city lives on in the hearts of the people who hold it dear. This story aims to give hope to hard working honest people, and ask how we should live by showing the lives of people after the disaster such as the rough looking Daruma, a former high school music teacher and current owner of a piano bar, or his former student, a young pianist who later develops dystonia and must learn to play with his left hand.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/f3t4fknJqZrDgCSSYKEsq8afxTn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Left of Chopin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
