Inspired by her time living and working in the city in the 1990s, Zausner created a series of three outsized figures made from rubber silicon and knitted material. This film features Zausner interacting with these figures in a sequence filmed at key landmarks in the city, including the Potsdamer Platz, Neue Nationalgalerie, Spree River, and the now-demolished Palast der Republik. In every scene, we see the heft of the figures counteracting her manoeuvres of them, turning the idea of the body as a metaphor  for the weight of history from abstraction to physical reality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Second Breath","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
