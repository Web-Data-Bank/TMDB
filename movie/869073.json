On the other side of the screen.\r The voice then asks us to project ourselves into a scenario, into the film of that inevitable eventuality we all prefer not to think about: the passage from one side of the screen to the other, from being “there” to “no longer being there,” from “here” to “there.”\r And what better place to do this than in a cinema?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/q0wDq20yt4OntReCRskZCYM2RT9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-02-19","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Screen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
