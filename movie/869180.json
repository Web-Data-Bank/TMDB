Brilliant American composer Matthew Aucoin now carries that tradition into the 21st century with a captivating new take on the story—a product of the Met’s commissioning program. With a libretto by Sarah Ruhl, adapted from her acclaimed 2003 play, the opera reimagines the familiar tale from Eurydice’s point of view. Yannick Nézet-Séguin oversees the December 4 transmission, leading Aucoin’s evocative music and an immersive new staging by Mary Zimmerman. Soprano Erin Morley sings the title role, opposite baritone Joshua Hopkins as Orpheus and countertenor Jakub Józef Orliński as his otherworldly alter-ego.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dDVy0gaTAVAXwf4j6IHPLKH5aIv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":183,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Metropolitan Opera: Eurydice","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
