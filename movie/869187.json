This rich and fascinating special presentation includes a range of remarkable and rarely seen footage from the vaults of Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision. From the first filmed encounter between Māori and British Royals to footage of the 1975 Land March, these recordings evoke a strong sense of the shared stories and rich dual histories of Aotearoa New Zealand.  These special recordings come from Ngā Taonga Sound & Vision – Aotearoa New Zealand’s Archive of Film, Television and Sound. NTSV collects, preserves, cares for and shares the audio-visual taonga of Aotearoa, so that our nation’s stories are never lost.  Part of the remit of today’s cultural institutions is to draw attention to how our narratives have formed, and to gently nudge us toward asking ourselves to examine how we feel about what is being shown to us.  – Sharon Taylor-Offord","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"release_date":"2020-08-06","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Maori","iso_639_1":"mi","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ngā Wai E Rua: Stories Of Us","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
