For his grieving widow Beth, navigating life without Sproutman isn't easy, especially because her fitness freak neighbors can’t stop imitating him.  Inspired by true events, Sproutland follows Beth as she navigates the constant reminders of her deceased husband — in the local juice bar, in the yoga studio, and at home with her son. As Beth forges a path she neither expected nor wanted, she learns that life can hold despair and joy at the same time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":160059,"logo_path":null,"name":"Honor Society","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The widow of a healthy-living guru explores her new single existence but faces indignation from the community and her own son, who still see her in her husband's shadow.","title":"Sproutland","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
