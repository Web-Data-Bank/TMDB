In 2011, Craig Baldwin drew me a map of the city of San Francisco. Over the years, the city became my spiritual home, and Craig became my mentor. In 2015 I rediscovered the map and decided to literalize it. For six months I walked the streets of San Francisco with a Bolex, clicking off frames, simulating the map, enacting every single circle, mark, straight line, etcâ€¦ Part performance, part love letter, the film is a celebration of the City of my dreams. For Craig Baldwin.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kFqrh81VO2ur9i0PZj6SeQHMTsZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pilgrimage","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
