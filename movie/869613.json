It questions the contemporary condition in which the computer mediates our experience, and parallels Sugimoto’s observation that media has transformed the way we see the world. In this film, the shift from the horizon line to the world of the onlooker is underlined by the sudden entrance of everyday sounds. The soundtrack is made from field recordings taken every morning at the same time and location for thirty consecutive days.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nGf1tzFVu3FLVsraCExsAEOnaUL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-09-22","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"SEA 404","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
