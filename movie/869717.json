Not long after reaching the planned place, the controversy arises over the Quispe sisters, belonging to the Kolla ethnic group, and their mysterious tragedy, as the place is a few meters from the rock where they were found hanging without life in December 1974. The Pirquineros arrive at their destination with rarefied spirits. They set up the base camp in the middle of an atmosphere charged with disturbing mystery. There, around the fire, they begin to tell some ghost stories, until Pascual resumes the theme about the triple crime, providing a testimony about his experience of having witnessed the macabre discovery. Paicha, who listens silently and attentively, has a traumatic memory of when he was a child: hidden behind a rock, he observes a violent episode of repression and mistreatment of indigenous shepherds.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/geu9ppm5bBA7gCbZCHSu8Zikr19.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"2020-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tres Almas","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
