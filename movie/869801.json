This project is about the poetic instant. Just as a Haiku, it cannot be defined as such only by its metric; an instant cannot be defined according to its duration. The duration of an instant is similar to the vibration of a note, it passes through our body and leaves a resonance; we don't know when it starts or when it ends. The moment dissolves and makes way, but leaves a trail in its path. The instant is poetic because it is situated between what we don't have and what is escaping from us.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oClPsnCjd8FNOfIRm5LpLXeOCDL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2021-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The thaw","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
