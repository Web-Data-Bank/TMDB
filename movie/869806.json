The campus' student union elections have been skullduggerous affairs contested by groups including Young Labor and Liberals, the More Beer Club, as well as a strong contingent of revolutionary socialists. In 2003, the Melbourne University Student Union (MUSU) was on the verge of financial collapse. Allegations of corruption against the union's right-wing student leaders featured in the foremost pages of both The Australian and The Age. Having spent two years in the political wilderness, the campus' left wing factions united in a desperate bid to wrest back control and save the union. The State of the Union is a documentary capturing the bloodiest election in the history of student unionism, providing an illuminating and often humorous insight into the microcosm that is university politics, and perhaps politics in general.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/78fKn2ldHpkqymGI2dOuBvU22K2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The bloodiest election in the history of student unionism.","title":"The State of the Union","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
