It uses the tropes of scholarly presentation and personal confession alongside extracts from the artistâ€™s work, guest interventions, martial arts and meditation exercises and evidentiary found material.  The film tests the limits of access that working-class artists have to cultural production and to the relevant institutions circulating these outcomes. Alternately playful and provocative, serious and satirical, Art Class favors wit over weaponizing and reflection over rhetoric but does not pull its punches when it comes to the real obstructions to working class creative progress, or to the strategies necessary to overcome such outmoded hindrances.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kNyUrN19Om2NYZEDWKGvfyife6v.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Art Class","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
