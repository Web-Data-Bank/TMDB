He pulls over and offers the out-of-work stud a meal and a ride. He agrees and the two drive off to Cole's work ranch.\r Once at the ranch Cole notices his sexy young son Cameron Marshall intimately speaking to one of his black workers (Jason Tiya). Alarmed by how friendly they look together Cole violently scolds his son for fraternizing with the help and reminds him of the class distinction between them and their workers. Upset by his father's racist words, Cameron runs out into the fields and thinks about how unfair it all seems. In the meantime, Cole asks his foreman, Aron Ridge, to watch over the house while he's out doing errands. But before he leaves he threatens the muscular black hunk to keep his mouth shut about what they've been doing after hours or he'll have no other choice but to have him sent back to prison.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gGC3Fda1sh3T6CO29URLHexHV4i.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6473,"logo_path":"/jcTK9eIgnwOo9JTRGUrbexBZJrF.png","name":"Channel 1 Releasing","origin_country":"US"},{"id":153980,"logo_path":null,"name":"10/9 Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":108,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black Meat White Heat","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
