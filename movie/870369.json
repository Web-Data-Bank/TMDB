In the Bataclan club, 90 terror victims died. ARTE once again documents the international police investigations on the occasion of the beginning of the trial against the only surviving terrorist Salah Abdeslam and 19 other suspects. The Islamist attacks of November 13, 2015 shook Paris and the rest of the world. The system's weak points that effectively enabled the attacks were investigated in 2016 by a parliamentary study group, finally summarizing its finds in a dossier. Francis Gillery's documentary \"Les ombres du Bataclan\" is based on this dossier. It details the investigations and the course of events.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6Llf8MPkJahg09LgAa3z04U30VR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90430,"logo_path":null,"name":"Day For Night Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-08-27","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les ombres du Bataclan","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2}
