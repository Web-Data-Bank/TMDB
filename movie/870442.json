Passers-by who gravitate around avoid it, ignore it or come to its aid.  The sudden interest of journalists in this man will lead us into a grotesque and absurd media vortex questioning our relationship to society and the media.

It becomes an experience of the absence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uFHrtSgpPNy2RD8YJQlGQ9y5ent.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12434,"logo_path":"/9rfMaAC5f84cCmmVmYv29nGkdY1.png","name":"Autour de Minuit","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-09-08","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Absence","video":false,"vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":2}
