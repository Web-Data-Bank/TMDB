A sequel to the police story Girl Detective 001 (1966), director Chor Yuen and scriptwriter Szeto On retain the undercover plot but turn the film into more of an atmospheric mystery, in which a series of murders are committed after the victims are served with a provocative Death Pass. Connie Chan Po-chu stays truth to the ‘Jane Bond' persona of a virginal action woman, exuding tender charm and steely professionalism all at once. Under Chor's able direction, Szeto's complicated story is executed with style and vigour, culminating in a climatic dramatic plot twist, realised beautifully by the performance of veteran actor Leung Sing-por.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":157676,"logo_path":null,"name":"Golden Orchid Movie Enterprises Co.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1967-08-09","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Death Pass","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
