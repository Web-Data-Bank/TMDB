We start at Paddington for a run along the Greenford branch taking us over the Great Western main line via Ealing Broadway, the line terminating at Greenford sandwiched between the tracks of LUL’s Central Line.  We then travel over the Windsor branch from Slough into the one-time showpiece Royal station facing Windsor Castle. Unusually we return part of the way to show the junction arrangement at Slough.  The Marlow branch is the fascinating legacy of the one-time through route to High Wycombe requiring a reversal at the constricted junction at Bourne End.  Finally, we travel over the line to Henley on Thames. All trains on the four branch lines consist of 2-car class 165 Turbo DMUs.
