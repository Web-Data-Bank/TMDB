Originally consisting of 468 apartments, the White Building (like the whole city that surrounds it) was abandoned during the Khmer Rouge regime rule in the 1970s. After their fall in 1979, the building fell into disrepair but was still a home for its original residents, artists, community educators and others who built a vibrant community there. Tith’s film is a patient walkthrough of the “boding” (as it is popularly called by locals) that allows the viewer an unhurried look at its corridors, surfaces and the manifestations of life inside and around it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8YvuOswo7v2KgC5sTnqFaAnBJoj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KH","name":"Cambodia"}],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boding","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
