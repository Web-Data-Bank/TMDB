My father-in-law passed away one day in January 2021 when it was snowing. I looked up photos and videos of him with my wife and fixed my gaze at the record of the trip two years ago. His body was with us, but often his mind was beyond our reach. What was he looking at, how was his time going?  The time of this work moves forward as a whole, but continues to reverse in frame units. The cinematic time of eight, eleven, and fourteen frames, which is going backward, is in line with the way he experiences time with dementia. Like the scenery of a train rushing in front of him, his time runes forward, but his memory continues to backtrack.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2021-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Time Reversed Time","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
