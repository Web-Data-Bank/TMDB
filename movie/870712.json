She falls in love with Armando, aka Amanda, a young transvestite who is attracted to the young girl's innocence and begins an unhealthy relationship of mutual dependence with her. Amanda runs a carousel at the fair across the street from Benedetta's house, and the girl is magnetically drawn to this colorful and exciting world. But Amanda not only runs the carousel, she's also a call boy and sells drugs. Between intoxication and family rebellion and the discovery of sex - a great disappointment - she completes her rite of passage into adulthood.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/sWKNhW8R6TzBKpgtKNF9pCJHvzR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76129,"logo_path":"/wadqq2xlU1fWkRT2BSOb2VDyDVZ.png","name":"Tempesta","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":34086,"logo_path":"/aBKkhycyubHlCsszV8KibiKZGg0.png","name":"tellfilm","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":155990,"logo_path":"/py9VaywwK6KVi94YwrxSKVg1gkh.png","name":"RAI Cinema","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":317,"logo_path":"/HJj0J9Tk6AGcLpL4O7mI3bsccM.png","name":"Istituto Luce Cinecitt√†","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2022-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Swing Ride","video":false,"vote_average":5.417,"vote_count":6}
