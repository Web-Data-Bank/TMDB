Due to the lack of maintenance and altered ideas about design in public space, the city hall – once a showpiece – is no longer beloved and is threatened by demolition. The film ends with a number of slides that were made by the architect during the opening in 1974: visitors gaze with admiration at an unknown modernity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aBUU10idlcTeKt6qDWk0njJGUnU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"City Hall Ahlen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
