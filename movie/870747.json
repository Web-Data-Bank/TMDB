But his life of a being without shade soon becomes unbearable; he is stigmatized as a being apart and is the laughing stock of everyone he crosses. Strange story of a being become strange. So he decides to re buy it back but for that will have to sell his soul to the devil. The shadow (black) is a double that never leaves the Being. The white shadow, negative of the previous one, is obtained by means of a china plate with bas-relief motifs and lit by the back. The expression \"White Shadow\" thanks to its poetic power became the title of a film by Flaherty, then the name of a bookstore, which was so flourishing that by consulting google today I could not find the origin of the word.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ombre blanche de l'homme qui marche","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
