The party lasts 24 hours without interruption. The most reckless among the public, often under the influence of alcohol, must raise the animal and move it forward on its two hind legs as long as possible. The musical motif is constantly repeated and becomes a haunting, obsessive tune. The images were captured with what I had on hand: a mobile phone that forced me to record very short sequences. The montage highlights the power of enchantment by repeating situations, gestures and musical motifs.
