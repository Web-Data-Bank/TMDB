They are confined, deconfined, reconfined. Together they play Phèdre by Jean Racine. This film is a real immersion in a theatrical troupe that wants to be, despite everything. Through Phèdre and her people, it is also the history of the place of Art that is questioned: what is the point of creating if it is to do so against one's artistic requirements? Out of resistance, no doubt.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eX9nGOKLfaI0mYyhBXOVSE36kJA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":207,"logo_path":"/uskenzq65wJe0cT0D8StQI3hJnO.png","name":"Agat Films \u0026 Cie / Ex Nihilo","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":53509,"logo_path":"/xmJMAss7BDsQPvODjYkDQKiNhUX.png","name":"Wrong Men","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Phèdre against Covid","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
