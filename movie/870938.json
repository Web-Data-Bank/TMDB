Then the jokes would flow, the tricks fall flat and an open-mouthed Cooper would reduce them once more to helplessness. And so, for 30 years, this burly, gangly, seemingly incompetent magician dominated light entertainment television.  This compilation features Tommy Cooper at his best: from his early TV show It's Magic to his Variety Show turns, and from his famous chat show appearances to his performances on his own TV shows in the 1970s.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/f2LitSYqTzTQPyED0KlnqD12pQl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-05-17","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A celebration of a unique talent - the greatest comic magician ever","title":"The Best of Tommy Cooper","video":true,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2}
