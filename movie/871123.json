The one between Pablo Picasso and Jean Cocteau explores forty-eight years of a complex and tormented artistic friendship. Through their letters, the film unfolds the story of a talent and a genius, a unique story that sweeps across the artistic and political spectrum of fifty years of the twentieth century: cubism, Russian ballets, Guernica, the Occupation and the purge, Dora Maar, Jean Marais, Cocteau's film poetry, Picasso's ceramics and the Mediterranean sky.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/urSVTRqU8jsw4fgAoOB10IwRhBk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":86738,"logo_path":null,"name":"Schuch Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":22642,"logo_path":"/gqFSMOsv68FkYalHrKbUvq3pGwh.png","name":"Ina","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":134047,"logo_path":"/eACqHIgivbwjN9sjAc7e3fKRrXd.png","name":"Bibliothèque nationale de France","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Correspondances : Jean Cocteau - Pablo Picasso","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
