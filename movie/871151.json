It was not the grotesque beings nor the monsters, but it was he who “was here, but wasn't here”. He was the phantom. Buried under memories full of inhibition and promises that never kept – words washed up on the shore – time keeps him at a distance from the “place”. And he hears poems coming on the waves from the other side rhyming and lapping against the shore. A 360° scope video Installation commissioned by Nagano Art Museum.","popularity":0.614,"poster_path":"/fLdKXFlyjS8ninqAYj8NchTuhi0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2021-04-10","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Iizuna Fair","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
