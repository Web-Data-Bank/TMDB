For several years the two colleagues Stefan and Niki, together with their families, have attempted to find a dignified life and a bit of happiness in Ghent, Belgium. In the industrial periphery of the city, they take shelter in a rotten, collapsed barrack on the immense domain of the public transport company De Lijn, hoping for a job, social support or a home that will never come. On The Edge Of Happiness is a social surreal, observational, existential film that penetrates and respectfully portrays the life in the barracks. It's a story about friendship, dreams, perseverance, social justice, poverty, inter-European migration, human rights, tolerance, loyalty and ultimately fate. A contemporary Beckett's 'Waiting for Godot' in our fragmented European backyard, in the shadow of the current migration & homeless crisis.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On the Edge of Happiness","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
