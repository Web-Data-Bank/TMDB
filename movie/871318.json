My dog Hun and I used to play hide and seek together when I was a kid. Every time we played hide and seek, I always hid behind the door, under the bed, or in the wardrobe. When I was 22, Hun died in an accident. After a year, a new dog named Bom became part of my family. At first I did not accept her as family because I thought she could never replace Hun. So I tried to keep her at arm's length. But one day Bom licked my empty heart and my defenses melted away. In my film, all the characters are expressed simply: circular, square-shaped, and flower-like. They can be anything corresponding to your experience. For me, this film is a story of my dog, however, it can be a story of your childhood or a story of your family.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cache-Cache","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
