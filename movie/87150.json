Lucia, his wife, tired of his fiction, starts an affair. But not even the confession of infidelity touches Gross, who is caught up in the story of a script that is writing, whose idea is so powerful that dominates it completely. Lucia, after seeing that Gross is unshakable, decides to leave. But Gross wastes no time: the same day replaces Lucía by Laura. From day one, Gross confuses the names of women. Thus Laura is transformed into a second copy of the true love of Gross.","popularity":1.576,"poster_path":"/A2HdW03LclMe5T8gHvCT2aDn6aw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2011-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Together Forever","video":false,"vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":26}
