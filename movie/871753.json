The body of the earth is burned by shells, torn apart by mines - and we are its Parts. The heroes of the film are young Caucasian guys-children of the war that destroyed their childhood and youth. In this black-and-white movie, the past, present and future alike merge into the color of the tragedy of all times and peoples – the color of war.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Body Parts","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
