Carmen is a teenager who lives with her father in an old house of the poor area. The Father, due to an accident, can no longer walk, which he tries to conceal from the rest of the people, as he thinks that, if it became known, everybody would regard his daughter as unprotected. It is therefore Carmen who leaves home every day to find work and/or something to eat.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gBj8fk7bFfhhJwhrPxR5na3DQbu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2020-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Father, Daughter and Old Woman","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
