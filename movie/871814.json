At the end of the day, the dream is not always the cookie cutter house, the nine to five workday, the fancy car, and the repetition of the daily routine. A hidden number of people have decided to take a step back and reside alternatively, giving up the ideal of having the typical “American Dream” lifestyle. ​Connected Off the Grid​ follows three distinct individuals who have found the perfect balance between staying connected and disconnected at the right times in our world today. From Garth, a desert dweller who lives in a cement tipi to Stan, a tree-sitter fighting to save the Redwood forest, and to a family of four who live on a boat moored out on the water in preparation to sail around the world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sPQsSCGWeEPP8JhfJouauxr6bFs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-02-24","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Connected Off the Grid","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
