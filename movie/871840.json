We follow the moonwolves on their adventurous attempts to get to the moon; a sad circus princess who succeeds in catching and closing in the night;  and we meet a robot, even though it's just a machine yet it cares about everything that lives, and therefore put its life to danger to save a stranded whale.  Sagoland is a warm, fun and thoughtful experience for children.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rWarre8DWv9wvjETfCJtLgKBNhj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":122594,"logo_path":"/w7CeTbwg9SmhZVilZXh4Yy1yp6Y.png","name":"HOBAB","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sagoland","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
