After 17 years behind bars, Jonas offers his voice into the critical conversation about how we as a society can heal and prevent violence by reimagining masculinity to build a better, more equal future.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/q26pQY3szZHIXLiybMastScRWzL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-02-26","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Resurgence","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
