Starting Here, Starting Now offers a tender-tough inventory of love and the lonesome lack thereof. Made for each other, the wry lyrics of Richard Maltby, Jr., combined with David Shire‘s buoyant music, forge a fast-moving, ingratiating look at how love can go right, wrong or nowhere. This bold, extroverted journey takes a winsome cast of four through the maze of modern relationships with its heart firmly on its sleeve. As with all of Maltby and Shire’s work, each song is an impeccably crafted story – original, engaging, and bursting with character.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/okOB8WzzzjqD0RcWcS5WrWJJzII.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":143811,"logo_path":null,"name":"San Francisco Playhouse","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Starting Here, Starting Now","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
