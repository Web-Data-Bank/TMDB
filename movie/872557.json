Ghassan Salhab and Mohamed Soueid are embracing a sense of survival. This film is a sixth sense they nurtured in a world that has become faceless. Their film essay is a personal attempt to be two in one. Disguised as men, they walk among men who left behind their shadows.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4aYb8qKGuLis9q8Sjtnd3n14KDK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"As Far as Yearning","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
