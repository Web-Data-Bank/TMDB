Ewen Spencer’s exhilarating film is told through Grime’s grass-roots originators, from major players like Dizzee Rascal, to unsung heroes such as DJ Slimzee, along with behind-the-scenes operators who propelled, and continue to drive, the music’s relentless 140BPM heartbeat. 8 Bar shines a light on an untold history, bringing a cultural art-form the recognition it deserves and highlighting the impact of these Black British artists on contemporary music, fashion and popular culture.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/35s7ydxYUjzaF64xujoXJX5vuwt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"8 Bar – The Evolution of Grime","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
