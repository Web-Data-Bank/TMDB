The exhibition is archiving a condition that may not exist decades from now. It is itself a record of the anxiety and unease around where, how and what is the physical self when one is in a social relation in cyberspace. Rafman’s work asks us to implicate ourselves in this process as both the creator and the subject, the archivist and the archived.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kVIM8kHVZ5VgjU3360XJ3uoJDxe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Annals of Time Lost","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
