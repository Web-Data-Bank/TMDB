She lives with her father Bruno in a small country village where she works as a shepherdess. They live very simply yet harmoniously with the villagers. Their lives are disrupted when Bruno gives in once again and once too many to his gambling addiction, in spite of his efforts to quit. Gioia will have to follow him to a faraway town, where he will be treated in a specialized center. This will radically change her existence, forcing her to abandon the safety of the village, her friends and her habits. She will be all by herself to support her father, in his journey for a better life.","popularity":1.076,"poster_path":"/p04NWuYEuwMcbdXyKSgH9ucbQB4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6275,"logo_path":"/ynsdOyF03HZvEeZreVrDLc3OPEc.png","name":"BiBi Film","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":160744,"logo_path":"/wsjRnaomj8dURqYvnEWImyQXkoW.png","name":"Elsinore Film","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":155990,"logo_path":"/py9VaywwK6KVi94YwrxSKVg1gkh.png","name":"RAI Cinema","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2022-10-05","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anima Bella","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":5}
