Jean Libon and Yves Hinant lead a police investigation unlike anything you’ve ever seen. With every banal turn of events, camaraderie and professionalism go hand in hand as humour meets tragedy and a handful of fries, a Tupperware container and St. Rita heighten the suspense. Hilariously scathing, yet filled with tenderness.","popularity":0.786,"poster_path":"/8SZbbZnFYylGiYDrEbiRNDqf97a.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":172775,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Bureau Sales","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Urdu","iso_639_1":"ur","name":"اردو"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"For a Fistful of Fries","video":false,"vote_average":7.136,"vote_count":11}
