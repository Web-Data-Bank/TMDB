There’s a lot of nostalgia for the nineties at the moment, especially from people too young to remember it who see the decade as a simpler, pre-internet time. Modern nostalgia often draws on corporate American-90s mall culture, but what about British culture? With I’ve Been Trying To Tell You – made to accompany the Saint Etienne album of the same name – director Alasdair McLellan evokes the era through the fog of memory. The resulting film, shot in locations from Grangemouth to Portmeirion to Southampton, is both beautiful and enveloping.","popularity":0.62,"poster_path":"/n3eolzEJpzmHjzimU8hkDMoUFe9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7281,"logo_path":"/lkqIuaKTm2sg3umwTBScmqyzLX5.png","name":"BFI","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-09-10","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Saint Etienne present a beautiful and enveloping nostalgia trip through 1990s Britain.","title":"I've Been Trying to Tell You","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
