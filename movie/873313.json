Her expression is impassive. Her image flickers slightly, and we watch her abdomen grow, realizing we are seeing a time-lapse sequence of her pregnancy. After 17 seconds, the timer rings; a baby appears in her arms, and the time-lapse gives way to real time. A mother's beatific smile appears as she cuddles the child.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1rGdvNCTIUMqAbrZ297EcyiFWQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"17 Seconds to Sophie","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
