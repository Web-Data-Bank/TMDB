In the midst of this ecological questioning that challenges us today more than ever, in the end, no one really knows. Yet behind that word lies an inexhaustible hat full of wonders, all of a beauty that could be called naturally simple. This documentary will take you to meet a family who practices permaculture on a daily basis and will make you discover, through their testimony and images of the four seasons, how today permaculture is much more than what we could imagine. A true art of living for tomorrow.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/b6t2favomBPtEoWo3mXJOZFw1Bk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"What is permaculture?","title":"Permaculture en France, un Art de vivre pour demain","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
