We witness a group of smith elders making charcoal, digging and mining the ore and flux, building the kiln (with clay from a termite mound), firing the kiln, making sacrifices, smelting the iron, and forging the iron into tools. No iron had been smelted in the region for over 50 years, this video being a reenactment of the old ways – as they now buy their iron imported from China. It’s a fascinating documentary that can only enlarge your respect for the makers of the many traditional African iron tools and weapons we encounter in the West. And, you’ll see that ‘pumping iron’ has a meaning outside the gym as well!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aHCzfnBMPs194UmnTOErCP5u1sA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BF","name":"Burkina Faso"}],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":124,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Smelting Iron in Africa","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
