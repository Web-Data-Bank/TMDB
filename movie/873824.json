Her often uncompromising work included pro-abortion painting This Woman Died I Care, which was inspired by a photograph of a woman who died from an illegal abortion. In the 1980s, Eagle became a christian. Made in 2004, Briar March's first, feature-length documentary sees Eagle reflecting on her past with a more moderate outlook â€” she now has mixed feelings about her earlier stance on abortion.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zghdh3m0Tq12smviCj4zAg8FJEw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Allie Eagle and Me","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
