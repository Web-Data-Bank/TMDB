I stayed on the ship six weeks. Most of the sailors werenâ€™t allowed to leave the boat and they spent their days waiting, singing karaoke and telling me stories in a small TV room. In Syria, the ports were military zones. I hid at a porthole and secretly filmed the life below: a man stealing wood, a soldier fishing off the edge of an abandoned submarine. Later, I made a narrative, that falls between reality and fiction. It was a way of showing the limbo these men were living in.","popularity":1.341,"poster_path":"/cHaaXDsz3I8QXANXyt6JRAtdcsl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cargo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
