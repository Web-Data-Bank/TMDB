In 1997, a huge fire burned Tick Hall to the ground, leaving only the blackened chimney standing. The loss was a blow to the community and Tick Hall’s owners – talk-show host Dick Cavett and actress Carrie Nye – who lived there for 30 years. Because of its historic and artistic importance, they embarked upon an ambitious three-year project – rebuilding Tick Hall exactly as it was.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From the Ashes: The Life and Times of Tick Hall","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
