Starting from Kathmandu, they crossed the Nepalese border to ride through the high desolate highlands of Tibet Autonomous Region on their way to Rongbuk. Together they battled the biting chill, the dropping oxygen and their own personal limits, forming friendships for life on the way to the top of the world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/92j5LA7Rp1VQSbQgMgu81WxGpUl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160936,"logo_path":null,"name":"Big Monkey Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"},{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"},{"iso_3166_1":"NP","name":"Nepal"}],"release_date":"2021-01-10","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"},{"english_name":"Tibetan","iso_639_1":"bo","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Road to Mount Everest","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
