Some aren’t tough enough. Some don’t have bikes that are tough enough. And some make mistakes that take them out of the race. Sometimes, tragically, forever. This is a place where dreams go to die. Grand visions and hopes, materialized, but rarely sustained. The desert has this mysterious allure, there is freedom, solitude, and opportunity. The desert is the unforgiving canvas of life, and this is a story about the art of racing with it and against it.","popularity":1.449,"poster_path":"/uE2FcVlyBlphphk9qiCYtECqQi4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160941,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mojave Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":160942,"logo_path":null,"name":"Monster Children Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Desert Said Dance","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
