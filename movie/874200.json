To say that the two women don’t get along would be a vast understatement. Su-kyung, aggressive and loud, berates and humiliates her daughter at every opportunity. Yi-jung is painfully withdrawn, her face partially hidden behind long strands of hair, but the simmering hate she feels for her mother comes through in her trembling voice. One day things go from bad to worse when, in the midst of a confrontation in a parking lot, Su-kyung hits her daughter with the car. She insists it was an accident, but Yi-jung is furious, and resolves to take the matter to court. - FEFF","popularity":0.998,"poster_path":"/7XYQq9CrJfCw4LfbID79sf33UkU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7083,"logo_path":"/9wkXhZBSwVxslCpwS84LkB0VDOS.png","name":"Korean Academy of Film Arts","origin_country":"KR"},{"id":115237,"logo_path":null,"name":"Challan Film","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2022-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":139,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"Two Women Who Wear the Same Underwear\"","title":"The Apartment with Two Women","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":2}
