Oom Pasikom, a cab driver, is stingy because of his measly income. Conversely, his wife moves within the high social circle and is a spendthrift due to her business as jewelry broker. Through Oom Pasikom’s glasses, small stories of the city are told - the ladies’ social gathering, lonely wives, the cleaning of the city and how it affects the small businesses, a student who is writing her thesis and so on.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/19qMNsCqLmLsH7VL2GtnHXhWYua.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160973,"logo_path":null,"name":"PT Sepakat Bahagia Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"1990-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oom Pasikom","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
