A young curator tries to use daily objects from old Yugoslavia to explore how the old way of life sustains life today. This is an Odysseus tour of the cultural heritage of Belgrade. A traveling Chinese writer passes through the area and sees the lives of the two characters from an outsider's perspective. The film records what she sees, feels, and her pain. Though mountains and streams separated them, they face each other spiritually.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Storage","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
