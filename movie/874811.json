He is helped by the woman of his life: his overprotective mother, Teresa. Before the competition, Eryk meets Mona. As they go out on a date, the online world clashes with reality. But it is still less painful than Eryk's debut. A humorous coming-of-age tale about trying to \"cut the cord\" in your thirties.
