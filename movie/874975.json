How does it melt in the mind of a creative person? In the documentary film \"Wind from East\" the authors are looking for answers to these questions. In the picture, the two worlds are peace and war, but peace is a theater where preparatory rehearsal work takes place, and war is also a theater, but at war. There is another world that stands alone - it is a play played by actors, rethinking their own experience of involvement in the war and the texts of Alexander Dovzhenko and contemporary Ukrainian authors. These worlds combine interviews with people, with those who joined the actors' trips to the east, with the military, who received the actors and became spectators directly on the front line.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gsAMV2ujHQNvpLO7Uc3ujTeHjMg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2021-07-16","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wind from the East","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
