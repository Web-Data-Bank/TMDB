In addition, the cinemaâ€™s projection screen is attacked by breaking, cutting, sawing, drilling, and in one sequence is riddled with numerous holes. This destructive act is like that of Lucio Fontana who in the sixties became famous for the slits and drill holes he made in canvases, thus making the picture into an object. Cut and sound are synchronous, there always follows another picture, another sound, another action after the next. But in spite of the overarching theme, the viewer is meets with many surprises (what comes next, and where?), and is left in suspense.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"White Screen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
