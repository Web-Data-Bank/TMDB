But when she finds herself caught in a web of politics, corruption, lies and lust, she is forced to make a terrible choice.  To this day, Tosca is one of the most popular and ageless operas. With its cinematographic pace, abundant leitmotifs and massive orchestrations, Puccini renewed and transcended Italian melodrama and the verismo genre. Sondra Radvanovsky, Joseph Calleja and Carlos Álvarez lead this operatic thriller in the midst of a revolution, under the direction of Paco Azorín and the baton of Nicola Luisotti.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jUlhvcbS5B8ilwNuP5iFJKyvolK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71999,"logo_path":null,"name":"Teatro Real de Madrid","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2021-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tosca - Teatro Real","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
