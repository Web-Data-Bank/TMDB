But this metamorphosis comes at a price: she will lose her voice and be damned forever should their love story fail.  No reflection of a silver moon in the dried-up lake below. International Opera Awards 2020 nominee Dirk Schmeding stages Antonín Dvořák’s opera Rusalka at Staatstheater Braunschweig far removed from its usual poetic fairytale world. Stuck in the horror vision of a decaying no man’s land, US soprano Julie Adams embodies the title character lost between two worlds.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3BxhjMPweYJNWkVK7xvQKfQIGCy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-08-13","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rusalka - Staatstheater Braunschweig","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
