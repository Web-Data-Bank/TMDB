Both funny and gruesome, the film is imbued with an intimate and sensorial relation to images and music, creating an emotional narrative about the making of bodies, whether human or not, in science and preconceptions surrounding what is deemed natural and unnatural.  Together with the short film The Ovary, the film falls under the rubric of what I call Medieval Bodies, a set of films echoing contemporary issues surrounding queer reproduction and gestation, fears of artificiality in biotech, and the fluidity between human and nonhuman bodies.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-07-18","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meat is Not Murder","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
