It seemed that the life of the guide Marina finally turned into a series of identical, as if under a carbon copy, everyday life, gray as the asphalt of Nevsky Prospekt. And so it was, until the bus suddenly got stuck in traffic at the Anichkov Bridge, and Klodt's famous horses rebelled against Marina and her routine. What can you do, St. Petersburg is a city where miracles happen at every step. A guide can become a person, and the spirits of Nevsky Prospekt can breathe life even into an ordinary bus tour.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anichkov Bridge","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
