Commonsense and previous experience have taught her not to harbour any illusions concerning a happy private life. So instead, she finds solace in detective novels, television and cakes, which she consumes in large quantities. However, when two men appear almost simultaneously, her life is turned upside down. The first is Stas, her tall and handsome new neighbour. Dasha is smitten but is aware that he will never return her love. The other 'man' is Vanka, her eight-year old nephew, whom she has agreed to look after while his mother is away in a resort town looking for a looking to land herself a good catch.
