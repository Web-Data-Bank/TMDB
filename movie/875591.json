But if you build a machine of light together and learn to sing despite all, then even the most fragile creatures will be able to survive and win. This story is a chance for a thoughtful conversation with children about what is happening now in the country, or elsewhere in the world, in the format of the magic history, which always leaves room for hope and optimism.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/94mahSmp8XepoXKCoBSusxYOrwP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2021-09-02","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The War That Changed Rondo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
