They must decide whether to cover up the mess they've found themselves in or buck up and follow through with coming out as a couple. We Don't Have Gays in Ghana is a cooky, irreverent comedy with heart that uses humor to tackle the issues of intercultural relationships, Western preconceived notions about Africa, and the effects of hyper-religious viewpoints toward queer people in Africa.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cWVCZEm13ojUmURun2GPMfaqMWT.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Don't Have Gays in Ghana","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
