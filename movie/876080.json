The music here accompanies events in which the theme of the Sorrowful Mother is originally interpreted by the director and set in an undefined contemporary time. Atmospheric, strangely wandering, emotional narrative with a surprising finale, starring Jakub Józef Orliński himself, not only as a countertenor but also as a stirring actor.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8mvv2MNtmL5VTH3sTDMswdnlOwe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Vivaldi: Stabat Mater","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
