It's a stormy night and Natalie Mars arrives at a nearby hotel soaking wet after her car breaks down. The hotel is completely booked, but clerk Ricky Larkin feels sorry for Natalie. He gives her the last room since the people who made the reservation were no-shows. After Natalie thanks Ricky and goes to settle into her room, Ella Nova and Wesley Woods show up wanting to check in.  Jacob Stax and Michael Stax know that it's important to have someone who you can share everything with, especially dates.
