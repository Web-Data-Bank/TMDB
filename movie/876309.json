As such, he's gone to great lengths to ensure that he's a leg up on his entire competition- outspending them on various campaign materials, and even going insofar as to hire his own campaign manager Scott (Jordan Noriega). In his mind, it seems as though his victory is all but assured - that is, until the most popular girl in school- Skylar Morgan (Sara Thiboult) enters the race. With his victory suddenly far from assured, Marcus decides to take matters into his own hands and force Skylar from the competition by any means necessary. After a few unsuccessful attempts at persuading Skylar to leave the race- he enlists the help of an intrepid journalist for the school newspaper (Bailey Cooper) to leak damning misinformation regarding Skylar's personal life. This in turn causes a chaotic spiral of controversy and conspiracy that might do more than determine the victor for the Student Body election.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/78bXJ4ihFPUUWP6P1L5Iu9dj1iy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":161254,"logo_path":null,"name":"G-Star School Of The Arts","origin_country":""},{"id":161255,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eisenstein Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2015-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Most Intense Election Yet","title":"Student Body","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
