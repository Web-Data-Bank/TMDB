A gastronomic revolutionary and a culinary bad-boy, Trotter paved the way for the likes of Anthony Bourdain and Gordon Ramsay, yet his tempestuous, competitive nature alienated many. With never-before-seen archival material and new interviews with those who loved and loathed Trotter—who died from a stroke in 2013 at age 54—this absorbing, unvarnished profile chronicles the passions of a master chef and the consequences of pursuing perfection at all costs.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/ljexfxrA7elGLb7Pjmykmz0pb6U.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":161257,"logo_path":null,"name":"Oak Street Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"If It Ain't Broke, Break It.","title":"Love, Charlie: The Rise and Fall of Chef Charlie Trotter","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
