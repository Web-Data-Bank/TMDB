In those days, Soft Machine symbolized the uncompromising dialog between those rock and jazz musicians who were determined to create a synthesis of the untamed energy of rock and the improvisational thrust of jazz. Forty years later, The Soft Machine Legacy musicians have not forsaken their dreams. Immune to the leveling pressures of show biz, Hugh Hopper, John Marshall, John Etheridge and Elton Dean -who passed away shortly after this last reunion at the New Morning - still mesmerize their fans. Whether the cheeks be rosy, or the heads speckled with grey freedom is ageless.  Recorded live at the New Morning, Paris on December 12th, 2005 by New Morning Vision.","popularity":0.878,"poster_path":"/xvSZHqcn9aLO8vm8MuIiMzBaCH4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":116,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Soft Machine's New Morning - The Paris Concert","title":"Soft Machine: Legacy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
