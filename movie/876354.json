It is also where she met her boyfriend, Josh (Jake Adams), another junior counselor. But, as they set up their tent for the camp's annual wilderness kickoff, Leah finds herself conflicted. She loves Josh, but she is anxious about spending the rest of her life with him. He is her only sexual experience.
