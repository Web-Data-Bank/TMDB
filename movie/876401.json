In this unique program, National Geographic ventures past the heavily guarded gates of four American embassies to find out. Among those profiled is single mother Wendy Chamberlain, who was the new ambassador to Islamic Pakistan when al Queda terrorists attacked America on September 11. She relates how, with family and staff members sent back to the U.S. for security reasons, she held talks with Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf to determine whether the one-time Taliban ally would support President Bush's war on terrorism. It was a turning point in the crisis, and one of several dramatic moments in this fascinating, highly personal look at American foreign policy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mN3q04rrfFGiTBzn9nvnbFhNOJa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-11-26","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"National Geographic - Ambassador: Inside the Embassy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
