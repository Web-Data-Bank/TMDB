An out-of-control wildfire that threatens lives and livelihoods. A sudden tragedy that upends a close-knit community. You might not expect such intense dramas at a small conservation center in the California desert, yet that’s exactly what you’ll get in the documentary, The Center: Gibbons and Guardians, which includes interview with Dr. Jane Goodall, DBE, founder of the Jane Goodall Institute and UN Messenger of Peace. Watch it to get immersed in the sometimes funny, sometimes startling story of the Gibbon Conservation Center. There, a determined group of people dedicate their lives to the conservation, study, and care of these endangered apes — and in the process, find courage, laughter, and even romance. The film will keep you riveted as the staff face one challenge after another. The lives of the apes intertwine with those who care for them to create a rich symphony that will make you feel how surprising and passionate life can be.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/348cG2aufsYRDUmdFdaMCeosXtT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":44632,"logo_path":"/neCKH4sJCBhZ1B4QocTM4VXCQOR.png","name":"Gravitas Ventures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Center: Gibbons and Guardians","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
