We travelled to L.A., Vienna and Venice to trace the steps of the two genius composers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7NynqWFBEWynjqIx2Hn7v6mWPOL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":128729,"logo_path":"/nsFlJw9R4yq5YRFr0cIQ6uxPlUS.png","name":"3B-Produktion","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":587,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2021-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rivalry in Music: Stravinsky vs Schoenberg","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
