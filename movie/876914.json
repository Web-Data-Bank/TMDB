Luana, the daughter of a well respected man in the village, makes friends with Agim, who moved here after his family were banned from the city by the communists. Years later, their childhood friendship turns into teenage love, but without prospects. Luana’s father promised her in marriage to someone else when she was a child. When her father finds out about Luana and Agim’s love, he is furious and immediately arranges for his daughter to be married to the man he chose for her. Luana faces a dilemma: to flee with her lover to Germany, risking being caught by the communists and probably killed, or stay loyal to her family. A poignant love story set in dark times shaped by pressure from old traditions. A deeply human tale about freedom, which is the greatest good even if the price is loneliness.","popularity":2.213,"poster_path":"/2Q3BQptqZyPvmCcTCiH4GUwh5RI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1761,"logo_path":null,"name":"Elsani Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":11237,"logo_path":"/nzPEges9ftjCDQWru0qrIfTX8OR.png","name":"ZDF/Arte","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AL","name":"Albania"},{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"XK","name":"Kosovo"}],"release_date":"2023-02-09","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Albanian","iso_639_1":"sq","name":"shqip"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Albanian Virgin","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
