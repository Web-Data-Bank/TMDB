Students report on their heroes: Mary's is Jesus Christ, whose middle initial she says is \"H\" - their former principal, an aging nun whose picture is on the wall, told her so. Henry's hero is Karl Marx. Sister Gilbert sends Harry to see the principal. He walks past moms gathered for a PTA meeting, chats with Ms. White, the school's secretary, and enters Fr. Benet's office for punishment. Father takes out a varnished paddle with holes in the blade.
