They try to speak them out in French in a while, and it makes their conversation much ingenuous. Two men meeting at a park talk about their bygone relationship, while they just throw seem-to-be meaningless questions to each other. One man and one woman, they somehow argue in a café. Then they start to play Truth or Dare with what happened last night.","popularity":0.916,"poster_path":"/zV5zkOQGuZPWYcVhfFu6rZMz9yC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2023-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Conversation","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
