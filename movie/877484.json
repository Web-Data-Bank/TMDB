Acting has even caused a girl's death in Kabul and many young actresses have been forced to flee the country. Anneta Papathanassou, actress and director from Greece, visits Kabul to teach ancient Greek theater and record the lives of Afghan artists, who try to combine art and culture under very difficult circumstances in this troubled country.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nSz8uyuf6Tf885kCsax3J08OxxM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":76874,"logo_path":null,"name":"Modiano Inc.","origin_country":""},{"id":76875,"logo_path":null,"name":"Top Cut","origin_country":""},{"id":58945,"logo_path":null,"name":"OTE TV","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2014-09-04","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"},{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Playing With Fire","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
