The film is a surreal self-inflicted mental infliction that ultimately leads to its own demise.  Fear is worry magnified leading to disconnection between the mind and the body. Fear is just about the worst form of mental activity there isâ€”next to hate, which is deeply self-destructive. Worry is pointless. It is wasted mental energy. It also creates bio-chemical reactions that harm the body, producing everything from indigestion to coronary arrest, and a multitude of things in between.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/crh6sfdC1W1AH1BdmSyo0RAn5P8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Linear of Nightmare","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
