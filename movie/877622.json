Shadowed by the competent fighter Lung King-tin, Ma Tung-choi demands that the newcomer obtain the nuclear pistol from Poisonous Snake to prove her loyalty. Anna Tai of the Female Monster Gang intercepts the two and makes them yield the pistol before locking them up. Upon Lung's heroic rescue, Rose shifts loyalty to Flying Dragon but the Poisonous Snake spies strike, abducting the three to a garage where a brawl breaks out. Armed with the pistol, Anna frees the captives. She bestows the pistol on Flying Dragon as a token of goodwill, putting behind her unrequited love for Ma who loves only Rose. Poisonous Snake launches a raid on Flying Dragon only to be wiped out by the deadly bees that they breed but fail to contain.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":161420,"logo_path":null,"name":"Venus Film Co.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1967-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Blue Poisonous Bees","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
