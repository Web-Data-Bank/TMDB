No matter the model of Airstream — Bambi, Caravel, Flying Cloud, Tommy Bahama, Classic, Serenity — Wally Byam’s invention offers an elegant passport to a world where friendship, communion with nature, and international caravans continually weave together in unforgettable moments. Narrated by Kate Pierson of the B-52s, Eric Bricker’s film unpacks the evolution of Airstreams from simple trailers into platforms for free-spirited living.","popularity":1.163,"poster_path":"/vd4OwDIDGAKq6pKG4PTZc3luZwO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33802,"logo_path":null,"name":"Out Of The Box Feature","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alumination","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
