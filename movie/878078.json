Some of his innovations hold promise for sustainable living, while others - like his ice museum and airplane on stilts - are just weird.\r \"Never Had a Bad Day\" follows him as he prepares for his annual Energy Fair, a symposium that attracts high-level politicians, high-power academics and hundreds of guests. Along the way, we learn how Bernieâ€™s brothers with disabilities inspire him, how he came to live in Alaska, and how he came to his belief that literally anything is possible if you work hard enough.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rj7CzUfZfrVsfX27rmZani9YZU9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Never Had a Bad Day: The Legend of Bernie Karl","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
