Aiming to increase the listener's empathy with more-than-human worlds and recognise our interconnectedness with the rest of nature, we will explore the unseen through our consciousness. This practice draws our attention inwards, in effect using our senses as a microscope to visualise, listen and become one with the unseen world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fungal Dirt Web","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
