A poetic journey charting the changing emotions of Britain’s Black population, from a Caribbean on the SS Windrush – full of hope and love for the ‘motherland’ – to a disaffected British youth, angry, alienated and marginalised in British society. The film also shines light on the under-represented tragedy of the 13 British youths who were killed in The New Cross House Fire, on 18th January 1981. Splicing together archive footage and filmed scenes with other sounds and images, JUS SOLI builds a picture of an empire struggling to relinquish its colonial powers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"JUS SOLI","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
