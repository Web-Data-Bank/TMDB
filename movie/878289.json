The film is the result of Tabita Rezaire's research and expeditions to four megalithic sites. Gathering stories from the guardians of the sites, local populations and other understandings from astronomers, archeologists, and theologians to unfold the mysteries of the thousands of stone circles scattered across Senegambia, Mamelles Ancestrales goes in pursuit of an ancient African megalithic civilization so as to better understand our own.","popularity":0.73,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mamelles Ancestrales","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
