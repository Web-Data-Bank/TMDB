Michael Ballweg's \"Querdenker\" demos mobilize thousands of lateral thinkers from all walks of life and milieus who would otherwise not meet. What they have in common: the frustration, the anger and the hatred of the corona measures and the \"elites\" who have decreed them. Where does this frustration and anger come from in the rich southwest of Germany of all places? Why does a minority withdraw into their filter bubbles and ignore scientific facts? And why do they play such a big role in traditional and social media? The documentary accompanies participants and organizers at various corona demos, but also those affected who have experienced COVID-19 up close and have no understanding for these misguided extremists.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qYJDjdXH8Isk14NtxL7daN1e8Gd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":124,"logo_path":"/7MjDMOybX0D3fcIEpCyY9es5XZU.png","name":"SWR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2020-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Querdenker, Corona-Leugner, Wutb端rger - Woher kommt der Frust im S端dwesten?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
