Two characters talk about how to inhabit the territory. Their discussion seems to resonate with the landscape of brutalist and industrial ruins that surrounds them. A tension arises, between doubts and questions about their vision of the future. In contrast to the fatalism of one, the other argues that the ruins are a shelter for organising a common life and breaking the cycle of political disillusionment. Oscillating between cinema of the real and futuristic speculation, the work leads us into a poetic and political reflection on the mutations of the world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The School of Mutants","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
