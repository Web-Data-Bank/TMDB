We are talking about a new world in which plants and technology dominate, where we can finally know what a plant has to say. After all human life has disappeared from Earth, a bored artificial intuition connects to non-human life. A plant is having a recurring dream about a 'last observer' and recounts this strange dream in a dystopian narrative. All the components of the film take us on a journey through time. The pairing of the images of a speculative future shot with Super 8, a format from the past, creates a contemplative and rather endearing environment that throws us directly into reflections around artificial intelligence, anthropocentrism, and self projections.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Last Observer","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
