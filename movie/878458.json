This work - like Geraldine Snell's moving image work Dancing, exhibited at S1 Artspace - is from the series Light & Love. These works were originally shared on social media to provide a soft, haptic counterpoint to the quick, slick imagery we are subjected to in digital space, in unconditional eternal testimony to the sublimely mundane.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Still Life Moving","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
