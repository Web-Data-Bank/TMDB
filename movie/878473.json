It can be said that an artist’s first album is a product of their entire life’s journey. Megan’s is no different. Her cult-like upbringing gave her the drive to make it in a male dominated industry. By doing so, she was able to garner the needed connections to create an entirely feature based body of work with some of Hip Hop’s biggest stars. Although it sounded like a great idea, everything that could go wrong – did go wrong. In this documentary, Megan breaks down how she released her album in 9 steps, with help from some of her industry friends and family... so you can do the opposite.
