Zimka is 17, which makes her older than Nazmija, but she does not act her age. Their relationship is marked by the clash of their characters, but also the strength of their sisterly bond. Before starting high school, together they spend the summer dancing, singing and wandering around the parks and streets of Zagreb. Zimkaâ€™s departure to live in a student residence and her relationship with Tin put a new strain on the sisters relationship. The film follows the two sisters during a turbulent time in their lives, raising the question of whether everyone has the right to a carefree adolescence or is that a special privilege.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nd3pMFmai4shdrhfoY4SLlcRWSy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":64994,"logo_path":null,"name":"Akademija Dramskih Umjetnosti (ADU)","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"}],"release_date":"2021-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Between Summers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
