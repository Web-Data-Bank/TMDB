Drawing the strength to make the film from empathy, at the same time the director struggles with her own experience of sexual assault, experienced as a young actress in Serbia. Since she was not able to speak freely about the abuse she experienced, she finds the courage to share her story through encounters and interviews with other victims like herself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7FCk0W3LMpEFq6rmevfp7xIzssV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":172933,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hold Me Right","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hold Me Right","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
