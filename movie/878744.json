All three witnessed a tragic fate in an atmosphere of general indifference.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/62Mutz2tSymYrkqbGFTQQgDSDsg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":91911,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nouveau Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Thirty","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
