One is trying to understand the codes and unspoken truths of a closed community; the other gradually reveals his world. Daisuke Miyazaki delivers an unorthodox, futuristic sci-fi full of recursive effects and false appearances. Shot in lustrous black and white, featuring a series of still images, this impossible dialogue is like a response from the future to Chris Marker’s La Jetée. Harrowing yet leavened by humour, the story includes street kids, ancestral pariahs and, as you’d expect, yakuzas.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lrapiWBiX98GFkR7XDSL7wwUx2Z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97069,"logo_path":null,"name":"Deep End Pictures","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2021-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"North Shinjuku 2055","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
