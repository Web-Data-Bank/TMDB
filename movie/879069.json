Society here can only be described as a matriarchy, where beliefs, spells, and traditional rituals are passed down the female line. Musical contributions from village residents serve as a leitmotif for the film: unsteady renditions of old songs that reveal performances belonging to a distant past. The population of these communities has aged considerably — but the place itself is timeless.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vBtCc5IyDSMKU2tbOakInB81JMa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2021-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"OK Good, Pinega","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
