She is looking for the truth. Who was he ? What did he see? And what if he could speak? To her questions, the chorus of grieving mothers will give answers.They are memories. They talk about their sons who involve their dreams. They talk about the last instants, the desolation which pushes to go to sea and ask for justice ! In the same night, coming from the same village, there are nine kids who attempted the deadly crossing. Only a survivor could tell the story of this shipwreck. The film tries to be the crossroad of potential spaces and times, emotions and conventions that come from different horizons but keeps on running into each other.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Call It the Burning","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
