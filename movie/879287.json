Yet one in six Congolese people suffer from hunger. Yet one in two Congolese suffers from moderate acute malnutrition. Yet agriculture accounts for 70% of the population there. Faced with this paradox, the peasants regroup in agricultural cooperatives. A handful of them share their daily lives with us, that of all those they represent. Even if they don't know each other, live thousands of hundreds of kilometers from each other, participate in different agricultural sectors, their voices resonate in this powerful, sensitive and sincere documentary.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/a1ERQ1MkdA9PTDRK6lqB95XqKx1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Swahili","iso_639_1":"sw","name":"Kiswahili"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Awakening of Congolese Farmers","title":"Amuka","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
