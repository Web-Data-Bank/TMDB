When he discovered how strongly they reacted to his pictures, he decided to make a film. Black-and-white photographs alternate with film sequences, in which the miners talk about the harsh conditions of their everyday lives, while also rendering visible their pride, dignity, culture and dynamic traditions. Every day is night is first and foremost a testimonial of profoundly sincere human encounters based on respect, generosity and gratitude.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gG6nSS0tSOERPCa1lCLstrsXvq8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Quechua","iso_639_1":"qu","name":""},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Every Day is Night","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
