Manny Waks demands the perpetrators be brought to justice, as well as the rabbis, whom he claims covered it up. His father Zephaniah, who claims he has been virtually excommunicated for informing secular authorities, demands his name be publicly cleared. But what price will the father and son pay for blowing the whistle on the leaders of this powerful Jewish sect? This is a deeply personal journey filled with intimate, emotionally charged and candid behind-the-scenes moments of two people waging the fight of their lives.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mT0BHQFyraZeerrPLB7UwSYUMP5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2014-12-12","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Code of Silence","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
