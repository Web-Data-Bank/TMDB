With her fierce desire for independence and habit of pushing the boundaries, Billie finds herself in situations that, despite her best attempts at being a ‘grown-up’, she is not quite ready for. But she and her best friend Milla are finally given the chance to prove they’re just as responsible as the ‘big kids’: they can walk to the shops alone, without a babysitter. Along the way, however, their dark and wild imaginings suddenly become a reality when one of their games puts Milla in danger. It is up to Billie to rescue her friend before it’s too late.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mulberry Tree","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
