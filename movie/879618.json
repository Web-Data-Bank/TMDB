It does not deal with the site of memory but rather memories of the site through the concrete and physical data visible on the ground perceived as a holed-out space mined by disappearance, in particular the buildings, which subsist as ruins. This film is less preoccupied with drawing lessons from history than fuelling the present with a history that, like a blinding mirror, is of the utmost concern.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oGW31PQuS75F49Q1ulZTfhgVwgp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"War is Looming","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
