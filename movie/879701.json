Through the seven “wandering” characters that we follow at different ages, from birth to old age, we witness their dignified struggle for survival. At the cemetery, in an abandoned factory, in an asylum, in a landfill, in places full of sorrow, our heroes search for love and togetherness. By combining documentary material, animation and acting interpretation of the thoughts of our heroes, we get to know lives between disappointment and hope, quite similar to ours.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/itqo5Z7syYXBvLizwNPYyaQSLF6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117482,"logo_path":null,"name":"Talas Film","origin_country":"RS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"}],"release_date":"2021-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Serbian","iso_639_1":"sr","name":"Srpski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life of a Mutt","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
