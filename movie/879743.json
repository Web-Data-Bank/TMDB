At the heart of the film is Phyllis Jack-Webstad, the survivor who founded the Orange Shirt Day movement. While Phyllis recounts her childhood trials to youth across the country, her relations in the Secw√©pemc territory near Williams Lake are contending with another outcome of colonialism: the upper Fraser River's lowest salmon runs in Canadian history.","popularity":0.621,"poster_path":"/pD3mxjJ9P2oEMquU2Jmz9EfZuUu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":161811,"logo_path":null,"name":"Canadian Geographic Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2021-09-26","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Returning Home","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
