Eleven-year-old Susan Bradley has only one thing on her mind, and it's not schoolwork. It's Mike Nesmith of The Monkees, the popular pop group made famous in the television sitcom of the same name. Susan, with \"boyfriend\" Nesmith, lives in a daydream, a sixties riot of psychedelic colors and goofy, soft-focus, teenage-girl love scenes. Her well-meaning parents try to snap her back to reality, but it takes an informative copy of Teen Life to finally open Susan's eyes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7bHS4eXFfE7i7mAiu5OaXiNOMQc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":161821,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cosmic Dance Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Heâ€™s not the boy next door!","title":"Daydream Believer","video":true,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":6}
