In this remarkable documentary, director Claudia Schmid spends a year following the artist as he visits German forests, and ancient archeological sites and refugee camps in Greece. The Endless Moment documents the extraordinary creation of ambitious, large-scale double triptych paintings—from life studies to tactile three-dimensional objects—as the camera captures moments of conception, rumination, execution, and revision.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uxcR9KpmGbKugIWZDFBVVWy1xTs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":161833,"logo_path":null,"name":"SCHMIDfilm","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2021-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Endless Moment: The Painter Rolf Kuhlmann","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
