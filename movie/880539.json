Victor is ten years old and loves popular folklore. You know what it means that what you like best in the world (dancing) is what hurts you the most. His mother works tirelessly and also cares day and night for a stepfather who is bedridden but with a very lively, sharp and hurtful tongue every time Victor appears through the door. When Victor dances, he transforms, laughs, dreams, escapes from the reality he has at home. What he could never imagine is that the same violence he received would be his own salvation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/a8dwzxQux6Yl10HOrHhLN1SoA8q.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"King of Flowers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
