With his signature use of frenzy, carefree editing, nostalgic 2010-Youtube-era aesthetic, Transference brilliantly and subtly satirizes the overcrowded feel-good humanism-themed melodramatic media, enhancing the absurdity of moral propaganda and one's internal struggle of Marxism versus existentialism. The campy acting with overly delivered dialogue from Trần Minh Hiếu in his first dramatic role and a soon-to-be star, Trần Quảng Hưng, serves both as a loving homage and witty parody of a very particular style of acting popularized in Southern comedy and stage. Idiosyncratic, uncompromising, thoroughly hilarious, Transference refuses traditional film form to achieve a new astonishing artistic height, giving birth to an exciting voice in Vietnamese New Wave and auteur-driven independent cinema.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wFWYEaBE8YZOVk1FRHHriaVTscJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Vietnamese","iso_639_1":"vi","name":"Tiếng Việt"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Transference (Psychological Phenomenon) - A Film Project","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
