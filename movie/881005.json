Her keyed up imagination through lucid dreams becomes her – and our – reality. LUCID gives us the illusion that we are part of her world, skiing through magical winter sceneries, feeling and tasting the snow. It’s a dream though, and only by making it happen ourselves, the illusion becomes real.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3JMgw20XqW0zUrFfY8B7UH5ne8H.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Someone please pinch me!
