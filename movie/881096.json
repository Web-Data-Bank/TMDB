Unsparingly, she looks back and discovers how everything is connected; her youth in Franco’s Spain with her mother’s feudal past in eastern Prussia, her desire for music with the one for a dominant and powerful husband. In her ambition to be a perfect mother, she recognizes her fight for identity. But all of a sudden experiences from her childhood in a seemingly happy family crop up turning everything upside down.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nxkZT6r1ymi9HscJ1jO5ukwKLnS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":160521,"logo_path":"/4MEFxcWzBU6BWJYZf0AmW8AdkJ2.png","name":"TILT Production","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"First Things and Last Things","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
