Along the way, the policeman gives a ride to an injured man. On the way to the city, the passenger tells the policeman the events that led him to end up injured in the middle of the road. But as we travel with these mysterious characters in the car, director Loukman Ali shows us that the stories they tell are only fragmentary and partial versions of the events that took place, and that perhaps there are truths buried beneath each of their words.","popularity":3.125,"poster_path":"/dYFUPov4zuoB5F1Am9Ni8E5kCwd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":171030,"logo_path":null,"name":"Loukout Films","origin_country":""},{"id":123819,"logo_path":null,"name":"Quad-A Records","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UG","name":"Uganda"}],"release_date":"2020-08-24","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Swahili","iso_639_1":"sw","name":"Kiswahili"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Girl in the Yellow Jumper","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":23}
