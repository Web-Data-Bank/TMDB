The idea came after one of her \"grub hunting\" sessions (she loves gathering grubs for the birds and lizards). She loves gardening almost as much as animation, so it was a perfect fit.  The animation was awarded the \"Grand Recognition Award\" at the \"Ivie Awards\" in San Diego California. The video is currently being shared by many in the gardening community, who are encouraging Bryn to enter the film into festivals (because it's both educational and hilarious). Thank you for your consideration.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cBcdEwmZzaYgIbWWmkvQdhBZIay.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-06-12","revenue":100,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bad Bugs","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
