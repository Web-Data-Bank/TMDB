Until the end of the films, their true nature is the drama that finds a place at the borders and edges of existence, in which it will focus and intensify and that is why it is an image. . The action takes place less in the images than between the images, in the narrow sphere of darkness, which joins the image with the image and from which they draw their mysteryâ€¦\r Movements, rhythms, cuts: these elements give Feldman's films their body language, the invocation of their materiality, their eroticism. All the films are marked by the unforeseen: like sudden pain, like blossoming happiness, like the transgression of limits or barriers, like the explosion of colors.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7Ye7wTizF0mc0T8qTo9c7X1A0nI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"2 Chinese Characters","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
