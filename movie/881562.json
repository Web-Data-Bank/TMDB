The museum which houses over 38,000 works of art, never ceases to captivate, amaze and engage its visitors! This documentary is a total immersion into the depths of this living place, between shadows and light, where two thousand men and women work to bring it to life and make it dynamic. We shall meet those who are amazed by it and look at the bonds that are woven between the museum and its visitors. Using exceptional archives and accounts from famous people who have close ties with the Louvre, we shall explore what makes it still today a timeless and eternal place.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-09-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Timeless Louvre","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
