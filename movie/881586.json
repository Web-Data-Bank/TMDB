Teeming with raucous hilarity and channeling the series’ one-of-a-kind, trademark voice, Designing Women sets out to re-unite its audience—if nothing else—in laughter. It’s 2020, and Julia, Suzanne, Mary Jo, and Charlene are partners in the Atlanta-based interior design firm, Sugarbaker’s—but with the firm in crisis, they’re on the verge of a radical decision to sell the business and separate. A timely, whip-smart and deeply funny new Southern comedy set to take the theatre world by storm.","popularity":0.663,"poster_path":"/jiWxdfuQiN6ng29tDMu7mLT3mwu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":159836,"logo_path":null,"name":"TheatreSquared","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Designing Women","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
