In this portrait film, Mandrup herself unfolds the cornerstones of her practice—predicated on the synthesis of place, history, materiality, and sculptural—resulting in a consistent articulation of the contemporary. Her buildings always speak about a place. But who is Dorte Mandrup? What has shaped her approach to architecture? How does she go about her projects? While revealing something about Mandrup's inner and outer landscapes, Another Kind of Knowledge is a fascinating story about the essence and conditions of architecture today.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/grCo4ivzbgGFnZCrd9t9WLNXCiI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":52811,"logo_path":null,"name":"Louisiana Channel","origin_country":"DK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"}],"release_date":"2021-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Danish","iso_639_1":"da","name":"Dansk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Another Kind of Knowledge","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
