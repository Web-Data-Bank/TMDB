The effort she invests in feeding him is equal to the boy’s effort not to eat the offered food. The longer the lunch, the clumsier is their balance on the verge of fight. The duel between the boy’s resourcefulness and the spoon, the tears and mother’s love, ends with the victory of the more persistent. The last bites are either left on the plate, or leave with the boy to bed in his mouth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":64994,"logo_path":null,"name":"Akademija Dramskih Umjetnosti (ADU)","origin_country":"HR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"}],"release_date":"1998-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Croatian","iso_639_1":"hr","name":"Hrvatski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Duel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
