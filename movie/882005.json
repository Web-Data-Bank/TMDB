His possessiveness eventually repels her. But soon after, he appears with his cronies to kidnap, rape and force her into a shotgun marriage, all with the collusion of the town’s authorities. Lia and her family refuse to accept this barbaric ‘tradition’ and, despite the constant intimidation and violence, they take their fight for Lia’s rights to court.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/yeDOwEJGwced80Ix98IVfZEGRG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":118962,"logo_path":null,"name":"Capri Entertainment","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":97434,"logo_path":"/5h1zDeIzIMfkH1sE8WMffSFcpDC.png","name":"Medset Film","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":162193,"logo_path":"/y4CLYoDR0N6cbSZ9bae0hhhtMaU.png","name":"Tenderstories","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":115535,"logo_path":"/mYoc1K3UPAUqKfuCYkvDLJN2aAA.png","name":"Vision Distribution","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":155990,"logo_path":"/py9VaywwK6KVi94YwrxSKVg1gkh.png","name":"RAI Cinema","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":14016,"logo_path":"/snclwsIZQbgvqYCBJP8fqNlCA5y.png","name":"MiC","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":80296,"logo_path":null,"name":"Europictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2023-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Girl From Tomorrow","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
