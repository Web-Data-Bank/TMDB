Combining poetic observation and humanism with a subtle yet intense national feeling that is also very personal, Jennings was a visionary and progressive patriot in the tradition of Williams Blake and Morris. For the first time ever, The British Film Institute will release the complete films of Humphrey Jennings. This, the first of three volumes, gathers 14 films from the period 1934-1940 and provides a fascinating insight into Jennings' early days as a filmmaker learning and developing his craft. It features the critically acclaimed Spare Time and London Can Take It! as well as some previously neglected works, many of which will be available for the first time since their original release.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Complete Humphrey Jennings Collection [Volume One: The First Days]","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
