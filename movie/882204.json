This, the second of three volumes which collect together Jennings' entire output, gathers five films from 1941-1943 and shows Jennings at the peak of his tragically short but outstanding career.  From the rousing call to arms of The Heart of Britain and Words for Battle, the poetic evocation of daily life in Listen to Britain, and the powerfully resonating drama of Fires Were Started and The Silent Village, the films included in the set offer a lyrical portrait of the nation at war and a moving celebration of Britishness.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Complete Humphrey Jennings Collection [Volume Two: Fires Were Started]","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
