This, the last of three comprehensive volumes which bring together his entire directorial output, features the films he made between 1944 and 1951, and charts his transition from wartime to peacetime filmmaking.  Featuring 'A Diary for Timothy', Jennings' much-loved collaboration with E M Forster, 'The Dim Little Island', a muted but affecting celebration of Britishness, and 'Family Portrait', the esoteric Festival of Britain film, this essential collection confirms Jennings as a master of the cinematic art.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Complete Humphrey Jennings Collection [Volume Three: A Diary for Timothy]","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
