She came to Italy by sea, without papers, pregnant for the fifth time. Longing for her children, she returned to Ghana six months later – without her husband. The people around her can’t understand this decision. “You’ve created a mess,” a friend says. “How do I tell people?” a sister asks. But Fati wants to provide for her family, even though she still has to liberate three of her children from the custody of her in-laws.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kO87p3MKaHSHbe7xoIUR8tZhi4G.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2021-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":42,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hausa","iso_639_1":"ha","name":"Hausa"},{"english_name":"Twi","iso_639_1":"tw","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fati’s Choice","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
