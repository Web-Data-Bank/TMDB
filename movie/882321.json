Ignorant hand-downs from the past and the omnipresence of statues glorifying murderers are juxtaposed with an empty museum of indigenous history for which there is no funding. This film against forgetting by a white female director also examines its own position: she talks frankly with descendants of the survivors â€“ many of whom are choosing a scientific approach to history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-06","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Only the Earth and the Mountains","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
