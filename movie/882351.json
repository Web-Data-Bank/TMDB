But Stephen’s editor’s cut begins fully dressed: a tastefully lit stage overture in costume, starting from which she rearranges or rather sheds the material, reintegrating image and sound sequences originally discarded by Okutani, for example the titular statement of an Odoriko explaining her choice of profession: “It was about being nude at heart.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zNfg5VWzw3kpxn9xJTqrpSSLYPk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nude at Heart","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
