The beams of light, which seem to emanate from above, could be confused with helicopter searchlights, a reading whose symbolic significance evokes both security and baleful scrutiny. These sounds, however, are not only immediately associated with the events of September 11; they have also become a ubiquitous presence in the urban sonic landscape. Murray reveals the subtle disconnect of sound and image only gradually, allowing conscious recognition to develop slowly in viewing the film.\" -Whitney Biennial catalog, (2004)","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aC0ThudIyD7xzmQprrPpch6j7vn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Untitled (Light)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
