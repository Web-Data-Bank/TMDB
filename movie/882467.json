The film tells stories from the lives of three bendskins. Stories full of drama, tragedy and tempo - and insights into modern, urban Africa. Every day, Sani, Marie and Franck make their way with their fares along pot-holed gravel tracks through the chaos of the big city. Their private lives, too, are thrillers with open endings. Sani gets into trouble with his pregnant girlfriend's father, who's not afraid to throw his weight around. Marie is searching for a man who years ago raped her. And Franck is trying to get rid of a bag with shocking contents.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zQJf5j4ou2zFyjz288cgMJVMIVl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":168214,"logo_path":null,"name":"Der Erfolg","origin_country":""},{"id":168215,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wouli Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CM","name":"Cameroon"}],"release_date":"2021-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bikers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
