This documentary film narrates Shenzhen’s young history, centring on its role in supplying mass-manufacture and labour organisation to global markets, and their hand in catalysing its urban development, which is now in a phase of deindustrialisation. Composed of found footage, pre-recorded footage, sound recordings, and the voices of poet Zheng Xiaoqiong, local artists, researchers and scholars, this film allows frictions between workers’ rights and the waves of development facilitated by modern industrial logistics to unfold.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Port Park City","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
