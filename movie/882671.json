The themes presented are free: childhood, nostalgia and loneliness. The scripts elaborated are based on memories and experiences lived by the characters. The condition of invisibility, prejudice and stigmatisation is flagrant in the documentary’s narratives. The way the documentary is made exposes its making: the team and the director are unfolding as characters. At this stage, it is evident how the authors fictionalise personal stories from their past. The inter-dimensional perception of the narratives configures polyphonic plots, with forces in constant tension: directed with the most intimate for each character, and advancing to contemporary political and social issues. The plot surprises by this alternation of narrative focus, it manages to converge on themes that permeate everyone, and are common to all humanity, because of their poetic and existentialist character.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9Rm7dkBZ2WgdFA9UrClaLy8ndaN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2021-10-25","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You Didn’t Know About Me","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
