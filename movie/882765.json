Chances are that if this small town hadn't hit the headlines in recent years, you'd probably never heard of it. It became famous after Channel 4 came along to film Big Fat Gypsy Weddings. According to the local townsfolk – or 'settlers', as they're known – there have been travellers living in and around the town for years, but recently, the number has grown and grown, so much so that it's believed the community now owns more than 80 per cent of its land and property; it's also become the country's unofficial traveller capital. Journalist Paul Connolly has spent the past six months investigating the town and its inhabitants – and the results of his labours can be seen in this fascinating documentary.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Town That Travellers Took over","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
