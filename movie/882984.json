The kids are sleepy in the backseat. They seem to feel something cool when they’re half awake. All of a sudden, they’re riding the waves with their feet on surfing boards, surfing in the gridlock. The streets in a big city are like rivers and their branches, and they’re racing each other. Cars, vans, trucks and buses are surging like sea waves. Suddenly, a super big wave comes and knocks them off their surfing boards! To their surprise, a bucket of water is splashed over the windshield. It turns out that their mom has driven the car into a car wash! It was just their imagination. They exchange a glance and smile.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gg8f6wUhYa3DRZLv8uinFSx9Gje.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2020-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Surf","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
