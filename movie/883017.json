This film provides a penetrating insight into a hidden non-binary sexual orientation. Based on over 10 years of PhD and further research, it brings to life the personal journeys of three men based on their attraction to non-operative trans women. The film presents a compelling case that this sexual orientation has existed throughout history and across all cultures, but has 'flown under the radarâ€™ in modern society.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dPDu4zQJQpz4S87S9UkoUr98Ujk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ambisexuality: Seeing More Colour in the Rainbow","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
