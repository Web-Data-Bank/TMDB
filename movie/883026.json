From the memory of places and their context, the documentary delves into the creative process of three contemporary visual artists: Daniel Blaufuks, Pedro Bastos and José Rufino. Despite the different expression approaches of each author, we find points of communication in the way memory operates in their works. By rummaging through the hazards and disorder, we arrive at the director's personal mythology, assuming that memory is a fiction like any film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/s3dxCQZI2ib0PXHQGUI8d08pZuX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16464,"logo_path":"/iH0ZuDfP4IcZidBx6F8gY17DQ5u.png","name":"Bando à Parte","origin_country":"PT"},{"id":85992,"logo_path":"/79lj0eZq7mPrQTVCST019XlI68g.png","name":"Fênix Filmes","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2021-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Arte da Memória","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
