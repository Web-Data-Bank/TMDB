Fiction and documentary collide in this gripping film as “scenes” from the main subject’s life are re-enacted for the camera. What emerges is a remarkable encounter with a young woman, and a story that has broader implications about being young, being at the cusp of adulthood, and finding one’s identity; about how documentaries reveal, provoke and conceal.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cLcfn74CJmMSTUU4DTM48tNBJ5U.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-03-07","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Closer","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
