The characters of Tao Hui's early films are loosely based on popular costume dramas from 1990s Chinese television. Shot in brilliant color, the film follows a young protagonist clad in bright green historical costume. Yet from the beginning, narrative levels are interwoven as a contemporary figure is shown putting on make-up and dressing up. Except for one line, there is no dialogue, only ambient noises: dripping of water, animal sounds, singing, and the percussive rhythms of the marching band's playing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1t4CZ5vGA5NlO4OFQNneqCAVqYb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mongolism","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":2}
