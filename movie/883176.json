To the wanderers on both sides, the view posed along its length is a view of the conflict (from the separation wall, through the Palestinian neighborhoods and reaching the Temple Mount). Turning back to the landscape, and observing the Israeli people overlooking it, the film turns the promenade into a \"canvas\" on which the Israelis celebrate its confused identity - between the day-to-day and the national holidays, between the flowers and the memorial monuments.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/LJA60dx1BKsekxrajwTQWChw7h.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From Here You Can See The Viewpoint","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
