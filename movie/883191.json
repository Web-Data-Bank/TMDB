Surrounded by death, ruin and endless emptiness, he has only memories of liveliness left. These are the decisive driving forces for his arduous trek through the fiery wasteland. When he set out on his journey, he no longer knows. Nor does it matter.  With the urge for the last, personal happiness in his heart, he then lives through the omnipresent fear of the malevolent flora & fauna, which has grown into a poisonous omnivorous life form in the last corners of the planet. Finally encircled and paralyzed by the merciless force of nature, his body seems lost, but then he sees a vision of his destination on the horizon. Is this a glimmer of hope of redemption or just a blinding distraction?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tcf4cDa0rQ8pmt1OqqEMyaHqDOy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":74219,"logo_path":null,"name":"G.U.
