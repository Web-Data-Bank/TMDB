Collecting sports shoes has become their passion. How many pairs is too many? That question doesn’t exist in a real sneakerhead’s world. Thanks to them, we learn about the heyday of Polish design in the last three decades of economic freedom, but we also learn a lot about the importance of sport and music in their lives. Many of the film's protagonists achieved success not only in Poland, but also internationally.In recent years, the love of sports shoes has ceased to be merely a hobby of a narrow group of people. Their passion is shared by an increasing part of the Polish society, no matter the education, origin or financial status.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"TOOMANYKICKS","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
