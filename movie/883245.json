Krótki film o Tadeuszu Mazowieckim","overview":"Tadeusz Mazowiecki, the first prime minister of free Poland, takes us through successive stages of the political transformation at the turn of the 1980s and 1990s. He ponders, listens and negotiates sharply. He must be aware he’s making a great revolution. What values and ideals inspired this transformation? What can we learn from him today? “Make Revolutions by Phone: A Short Movie about Tadeusz Mazowiecki ” is a documentary essay based entirely on archival materials from various periods of Tadeusz Mazowiecki’s life, edited in a creative way suggesting that Mazowiecki is conducting the conversation with himself. Dynamic animations and young alternative music give a counterpoint to the story.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Make Revolutions by Phone.
