The old musicians struggle with passion in the need to maintain an identity, in a present where the social values seem to have to disappear. The old workers-musicians, receive \"Our Lady of Luján\" playing \"Oh, María\", remembering the early days of the town, of the factory, and of their own lives. They recall an idealistic past, where a Flandria worker used to receive a salary equal to that of a bank manager. They visit the closed factory -once source for employment for thousands of workers- with the knowledge that the country that they helped to build no longer exists. The old musicians gather to enjoy their friendship in the celebration of the 63rd anniversary of the band, while they fight against the ghosts of the economical crisis and social disintegration.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9hHVszQtzBSXdAduVKxzgN2BXTl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":162454,"logo_path":null,"name":"Escuelas ORT","origin_country":""},{"id":63474,"logo_path":null,"name":"Magoya Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2001-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rerum Novarum","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
