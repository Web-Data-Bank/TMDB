Why does an average gay male only live to the age of 38? Does it have to do with the choice of lifestyle? This film tackles tough subjects that are hardly ever brought up in the church or home. Understand the facts, the reality of the situation, before a dogmatic opinion is made whether for, or against the gay rights movement.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6p43XVtTsWgb9yYvoxGkuc0wYG8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gay Rights / Special Rights","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
