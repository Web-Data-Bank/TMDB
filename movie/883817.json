I had said shortly before that I was glad I finally arrived home. A song of hope, however, echoed with a fantasized happy ending (Hollywood kiss) and a song that heralded spring.  In reality the film did not end there. There was a second part to this story. The first tells the story of the condemned man, the second that of the survivor. And so the film had to start with a scene that could never be shot where I was escaping from the camp.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-11","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Une Histoire de Cheveux (Sibérie)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
