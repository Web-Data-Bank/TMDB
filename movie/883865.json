Looking for a viable alternative and hoping to keep his options open, he reconvened with his band to the English countryside and staged a concert in the presence of only the participants themselves while letting the cameras roll. (Eric’s wife, Melia, the sole outside observer inspired the Sessions title.) The mostly acoustic set was envisioned to be like an \"Eric Clapton Unplugged II,\" but not quite, as three songs are played with electric guitars. The result became far more than simply a sequence of greatest hits. Rather, it’s one of the most intimate and authentic performances of his entire career, an offering flush with real insight into the make-up of his indelible catalogue.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/awo7i6EZBlVBjF08wfGsoHCCOcN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eric Clapton - The Lady In The Balcony: Lockdown Sessions","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2}
