They tell us about a society that rejects them, streets belonging to the government and a vision of a utopia within creativity. Street salesmen and pedestrians form an imaginary choir of the streets, backing up the youth, suggesting the public space should belong to the public. The narrative is captured in a circular chronology in a single day, from dawn to dawn.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4u6QwdweD6s3FF7HGJXfFyJEBEO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2021-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You Can’t Show My Face","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
