At the same time, he moves in with a runaway girl (Yoko Oguchi), and the friction between them becomes more intense.  The film was made at the end of the eighties, in response to the sense of stagnation in the provincial cities.  It's a film with a darker side than my previous film \"Love on the Street\".  It also has the strongest theatrical colour of all the films so far, but it shows the bankruptcy in a different way to \"Street Corner of Love -\".","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8DHi6aQDRSJcUWu9k1QexJnG1ZJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":166941,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinema Variete","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Raigyo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
