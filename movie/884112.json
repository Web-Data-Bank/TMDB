The director shows the prison from an unexpected angle. This is a hypnotizing, oneiric vision. There is no moralizing here. The author is interested in a person and the most precious thing he has - his dreams and his reality. The film contains documentary footage from a correctional colony (a plastic recycling workshop and a residential block), mounted with a monologue of a prisoner in order to understand what is happening with human reality on the other side of the fence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bYGM9n2jpbKyfASqxq0nz5S9AgY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2022-04-04","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dream #9-2380 (IK-6)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
