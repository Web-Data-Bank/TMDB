The images of their lives are accompanied by the readings from a text by the German philosopher Friedrich Engels, especially his 1845 description of the poor conditions of Irish workers in England by using the term social murder. Combining these two components, it arrives at a highly up-to-date study of poverty, which is often accompanied by racism and stigmatization. – Ji.hlava IDFF 2021","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2021-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Social Murder","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
