They manage to remove all the wheels of the carriage, one by one. Then, collectively, they lift the wheelless vehicle and carry it down. The year of the film's production – 1979 suggests that the director wanted to mock the decline of real socialism. The system was weakened by the political and economic crisis. The collective effort of the men was a reference to the growing opposition.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iXWmTAqQpoQ8Z956gMI1yWgShIV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":157563,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Filmów Rysunkowych (Bielsko-Biała)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1979-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Z górki","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
