Mike insists that listening deeply to music, the music of Coleman Hawkins for example, is an authentic relationship, equal to human company. The movie closes with Hawkins playing one of his signature tunes, the jazz standard Lover Man, along with Cozy Cole (drums), Barry Galbrath (guitar), Johnny Guaneri (piano) and Milt Hinton (bass). The midsection is occupied by an outdoors swimming pool, along with a voice-over extolling the virtues of frustration.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lover Man","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
