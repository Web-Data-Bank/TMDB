This is by far not an easy task. In addition to the searing grief, dying also brings a number of tasks that are at once utterly alien and intensely time-critical. The main character of this film, Dovile, who unexpectedly has to bury her father, has to face the bedlam of exactly such a challenge. Overnight, the young girl has to become a skilful organiser of a family event, while also being a specialist on coffins, urns, wreaths and funeral feasts. Dovile’s journey towards organising a perfect funeral is inevitably full of hardship and mishaps, accompanied mainly by black humour and comical situations.","popularity":1.321,"poster_path":"/tEQEf5zM5al5gdy4d1KTkkzpdBM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48496,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Uljana Kim","origin_country":"LT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Lithuanian","iso_639_1":"lt","name":"Lietuvių"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Feature Film About Life","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":3}
