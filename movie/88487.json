Telling the story of a group of multiracial R&B performers, and how they’re affected by the death of a veteran musician from their circle, Stony Island is an incredible time capsule, and provides a sweetly funky soundtrack to boot!\" -- The Cinefamily","popularity":1.77,"poster_path":"/86TtclqErgJLP3VyV3KGrczfKNN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2377,"logo_path":null,"name":"Chicago Pacific Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1978-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"If streets could talk, this street would sing.","title":"Stony Island","video":false,"vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2}
