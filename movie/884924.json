For the film, the dolls were made using 3D scanning and photogrammetry of real characters, and then 3D printing. The painting is inspired by the stories of migrants, revealing a variety of personal, social and economic reasons that force people to cross borders. Visualizing internal and external migration routes, the film destroys the idea of migration as a problem.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life On The Move","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
