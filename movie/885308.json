As a condition for their discharge, it is specified that the younger boys should live either with their families or in government supervision centers. On the appointed date, however, Mohsen Ghaderi's parents do not show up to take their son. Another boy, meanwhile, Sohrab, an orphan, is not accepted in the government supervision centers. The film depicts the real lives of these two young boys among other inmates of the reformatory school. The past, the present and whatever is destined to happen in the future are what this film is all about. The causes of crime, the roles the family and society play, and the efforts to re-educate juvenile delinquents at reformatory school are of particular interest in the film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ymPgoeWqQGaFWwwNnKRu2HLTQkB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":66953,"logo_path":"/4JYTCYLW0ANUddBtjUvwa0MwRvL.png","name":"Farabi Cinema","origin_country":"IR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2001-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Persian","iso_639_1":"fa","name":"فارسی"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"You Are Free","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
