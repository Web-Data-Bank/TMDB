In its sum, this film creates the physical manifestation of the imagined characters director Taichi Kimura has written in his previous film ‘Lost Youth’ and in his feature currently in development, ‘Neon’.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yd7YrThI0DfYZctaIvu6nzLgqHe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":162664,"logo_path":null,"name":"CEKAI","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2019-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mu","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
