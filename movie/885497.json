The film focuses on the transformation and transfiguration of the two characters in the act of a frantic lovemaking. Scratchy animated lines, morphed body parts, fragments of flesh intersect and crash together into the rhythmical act performed by the deluded donkey and the tricked woman. There is no story, no time and no roles: only raw emotions and sensations.\r The film is made with charcoal on paper; the images are a series of drawings constantly erased and retraced. Funded by Film London Artists’ Moving Image Network and King’s College London in association with Film Club Productions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love in Idleness","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
