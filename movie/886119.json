This improvised singing tries to break the invisible glass that separates the gaze and the realities of those who can observe from afar and those who are observed, but who are mostly prevented from returning such gaze. Who/whatâ€™s missing in the room? The film was shot during the 2019 Venice Biennale and built around a performing action carried out by the filmmaker himself in the exhibition space.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/87S8X36WlD6Czpta35hd2XbZgMB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Seasick","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
