S. Langevaag sets out to the rich fishing grounds outside Aalesund on the West coast of Norway. The nets are set and pulled with a catch of about 250 000 Atlantic herrings. Everything is done by hand and very demanding. The herrings are shaken from the nets and taken ashore in baskets. Most are salted in barrels, while some are packaged in crates with ice. At the end of the film, we can see a panoramic view of Aalesund and its surroundings from the mountains above the city.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1914-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fishing for Atlantic Herring Outside Aalesund 1914","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
