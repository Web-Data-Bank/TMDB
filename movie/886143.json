The film showcases generous footage of her most memorable performances. In this Emmy-award winning documentary, the celebrated actress reflects on her life and work spanning the 20th century, particularly her years as D.W. Griffith's favorite leading lady and collaborator.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5Jl3P3TDL0G5GOf4xWR947FY563.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":57679,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Film Foundation","origin_country":"US"},{"id":99614,"logo_path":"/gXrb4q4TqBHCYEvjRa16WOE9NRs.png","name":"American Masters Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":8273,"logo_path":"/pXZ6qUs6bZUsS5zsRXrojW9aZ1f.png","name":"Eagle Rock Entertainment","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1988-07-11","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lillian Gish: The Actor's Life for Me","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
