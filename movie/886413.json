Set in sunken moods and deceptive images, this dance film is an elegy that marks the transition from one species to the next. \"Stranger Than Paradise\" is a reflection of the systematic expansion of the human and animalistic into the mechanical and sometimes their hybrid existence. The body is obsolescent: it is still needed but the preparations for its abolition are in progress.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/r13w2mJFj1nx2IU6Q9CgFfmF6zS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":67822,"logo_path":null,"name":"sixpackfilm","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":162788,"logo_path":null,"name":"Liquid Loft","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2021-07-08","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Stranger Than Paradise","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
