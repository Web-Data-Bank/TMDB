Unbeknownst to them, they live in a world of sin and extraordinary inexplicable weirdness (inexplicable because the movie doesn't put any effort in explaining a lot of things), made apparent when a man they killed—whom they suspect of being a serial murderer—comes back to haunt them one by one. Once they start dying, they start seeing the infidelity, the incest, and the debauchery around them, and soon they disintegrate under the pressure of the seedy world around them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":60513,"logo_path":null,"name":"Solar Films","origin_country":"PH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"1999-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sindak","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
