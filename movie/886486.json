These found sounds are heavily processed and woven into instrumentation ranging from electronically treated guitar to modular synthesizers. Toxic City Music evolved over the course of several years, resulting in a wealth of material which will be re-processed and uniquely presented in an improvisatory manner in live performance. The Wire describes the new work as \"The sound of things falling apart with unbearable slowness…[with Caminiti] reporting his observations with acuity, integrity, and artfulness.\"","popularity":0.809,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Toxic City Music - Evan Caminiti & Paul Clipson at ISSUE Project Room","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
