They also make up a significant part of the state film archives. In the newsreels, the recent past presents itself as a monolith of silent images, firmly stitched together by the narrator's voice and soundtrack subtly playing the viewer's feelings. It is exactly this original sound that the artist suggests to detach from. Just two or three minutes long episodes retain the original montage, which was meant to follow the upbeat narration. Flickering images of the past, which perhaps can only become enchanting to us today by revealing their muteness.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Daily News — A Chronicle of Our Days","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
