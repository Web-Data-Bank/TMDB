At the venue, Reiko catches the attention of a man, and even the young man at the reception desk gives her a heated look. \"Reiko says, \"Noh is boring,\" but Seizo warns her not to fall asleep, since the audience is all related. However, when the Noh play begins and Reiko looks at Seizo, she finds that he is asleep.
