The portrait appears on 31 12-by-9-inch flat video screens arrayed on a gallery wall to resemble a month on a calendar: a row of three screens tops four rows of seven screens. Each video runs about 20 minutes and appears to chronicle the events of a single day; most shots last around five seconds and the streams of imagery are not synchronized, so viewers face a kinetic panorama.\" -Bill Stamets","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8vISAL3ib7KOvqihvgACCKriRYJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"31","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
