Each mouth represents an individual interpretation, an interior moment of attempted mimicry.\" -Connie Butler","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-06-11","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Easy to Remember","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
