The main child, Jackie, is not cooperating and refuses to draw—he’s the example of a child that needs help. The other kids in the background are really strenuously drawing and making their marks so loudly that you can almost hear them as part of the soundtrack. I added in found drawings as well as made my own drawings of diﬀerent types of sketches you would expect these children to make—of their fathers, their homes, or their houses—idyllic scenes, essentially, that lean toward how to draw as therapy and the positive images that should be created at the end. I looked for a lot of drawings online and finding other people’s drawings of heads inspired me. Of course, using my own library, work, and aesthetic, it seemed to make sense as an unexpected return to the hallmarks of my earlier work.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-07-16","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jackie","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
