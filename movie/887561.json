On the right side of the screen we see Barbara, a young disabled black woman who has difficulty speaking; on the left side of the screen we see various white women holding children. We hear Barbara in dialogue with a speech therapist; she's claiming or trying to claim her voice and thus her identity. But we don't know what the white women sound like. In the drawings, the actresses are further silenced--they're figures in the silent world of a drawing. But what does it mean to take an actress's voice from her? An actress's voice is her writing, her means of interpretation.\" -Hilton Als","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Institute","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
