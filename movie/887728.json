In despair and frustration with the state of the world, a testimony to a time gone awry is born. The rescue ship Aquarius, whose crew helps refugees stranded in the stormy waters of the Mediterranean, is a space of imagination built on the humanist message of a photographer of stories of human misfortune. An existential shudder and schizophrenia of experiences framed by the numbers and statistics of the dead and survivors on the one hand, and the personal stories of the refugees on the other. The beginning of a new life in the face of a civilization confronted with uncertainty and unprecedented images of destruction.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7Gx4LGQEhpDBQmrjxOOLVQCGWOB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"}],"release_date":"2021-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Letter to Nikola","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
