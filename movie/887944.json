A reality that becomes oneiric, almost hallucinatory.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/etC4DHteF0IvvRNxFgFsuqmtjRj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2021-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heimat","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
