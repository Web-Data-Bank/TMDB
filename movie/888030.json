Inspired by Duchampian tradition, Pedro and João filmed a short chronicle of curved means of transportation in the tropics. Overlaying directly on the negative (camera editing) the feat of paradoxically freezing a moving bicycle wheel, a car wheel and anamorphic depiction of tire, João and Pedro constate that for that to happen everything else must be perceived as a gyroscope.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9Vl5P2n69QGjArwsG1z2A3XMDkU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wheels","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
