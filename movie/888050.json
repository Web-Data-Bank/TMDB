It is the effort to expose the heart through absence. Allowing the image to sharpen the senses to a past that still pulses in the present.

'Breath' is a snippet, it is the desire of hugging, of looking in the eyes, while relentlessly searching for air.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kVRSIlTdauidFbLpOox0bEuCZdn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"PortuguÃªs"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Doc","title":"Breath","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
