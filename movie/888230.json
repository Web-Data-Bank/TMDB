Thousands of women and transgender people marched through the streets of São Paulo, outraged by the profusion of feminicides and the restrictions on the right to abortion in Brazil. March 14, Marielle Franco was shot dead in downtown Rio de Janeiro. She was the symbol of the success of a black woman, lesbian, daughter-mother of the favelas, who defended in particular the rights of peripheral populations and fought against violence against black youth. March 15, black activists gather at the World Social Forum of Resistances in Salvador de Bahia. This film is about them and their daily struggles.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6DL4lrty3JmsiChe8iu19lE2DjO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Each of Us","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
