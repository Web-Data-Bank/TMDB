Ladislav Valeš sees the film media as the Shroud of Turin which imprints not only the surface, but also what extends beyond us. In the same way, the author of the film imprints Valeš’s face and figure into the black-white countryside surrounding Klapý. The shapes of the bridge and gravestones represent the architectonic morphology of human mind, which merges reality and fiction, consciousness and subconsciousness.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cTzmVyJr8oFxxNzBQj8dJlt1vx5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2021-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"History of Shrouded Screen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
