Thus, the opportunity to make a film for Sandoz was given to Edd Dundas, American underground filmmaker, who created a psychological study of a young man whom a voice of a divine apparition or a demon drives to committing the radical act of assassination. The film was shot in Japan and fuses Japanese symbols with a universal portrayal of the harrowed inner world of the main protagonist. Dundas relates the complex subject matter mostly using atmospheric photography and strong sound design.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1970-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Burning Ear","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
