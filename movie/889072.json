The author presents his apartment as a living space and the main character of the film. By engaging his entire family in the project, he creates a new micro-social model of his home, where they all act according to self-imposed rules. Events that take place are both casual and creative: the living space becomes a stage, routine becomes performance and the other way round, art projects become family entertainment, as well as a radical transformation of the home.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Modern Flat","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
