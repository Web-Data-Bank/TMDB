They experience issues of language loss, identity loss, and lately, an ecological disaster. Formerly lush and green, today the Nogai steppe is turning into a desert. In the autumn, the team led by a simple woman named Gulfira goes deep into the new desert for several months. Every day they walk for many kilometres under the icy, sandy wind and plant branches of Juzgun â€“ a shrub with long roots that can stop the sand. Will Gulfira survive in this battle for the homeland, or will the Nogai land disappear along with its people?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Against the Wind","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
