We come to learn that Mihaela's story is connected in some way to the filmmaker, Rachel. In this participatory documentary, psychological transference between subject and filmmaker is explored and utilised as a storytelling device. Where does one woman’s narrative end and the other’s begin? The line is not always clear. The film will dance between subjective and objective realities and illuminate the cathartic potential of self-authorship.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One of Us","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
