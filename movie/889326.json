The film focuses on the power of listening as a social, spiritual and artistic act – an antidote to the current pandemic of loneliness. The Centre’s visitors, who want to feel seen, welcome the camera as a way to reinforce the acceptance they seek. The listening sessions reveal a shocking and yet relatable social picture, made of voices that are not easily accessed, and that would otherwise remain unheard.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Listening Centre","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
