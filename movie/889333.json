Its economy is almost entirely dependent on the presence of U.S. military bases and Japanese tourism. Although Guam is located over 6,000 miles away from the U.S. mainland, its American-style malls and road signs are indistinguishable from the United States. The film, similar to Beau Travail, will bear witness to the activities of soldiers in a colonized land, while also giving voice to the natives.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sea, the Island and the People","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
