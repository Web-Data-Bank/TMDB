Desire Lines is a feature-length documentary essay exploring what’s at stake for everyone when our sexual desires lead to feelings of social and political precarity. Anchored in bodies, public and private spaces, and the changing social sphere of the bathhouse, Desire Lines is a timely new work that reveals as much about why sexual desires might change as gender presentation changes as it does about masculinity in our culture.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/f7fNqWm3JfeXeLEycS1UQMuZUcS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-18","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Desire Lines","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
