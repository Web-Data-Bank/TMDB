Why do our “experts” (criminologists, psychiatrists, sociologists, and clergy) have so few answers? And the “gun-control lobby”, it almost seems they want mass shootings in order to “justify” infringements of the Second Amendment and promote the globalist agenda. But is that wise? Scholars tell us governments have killed over 262 million of their own citizens in just the past century. So, is the reason we keep and bear arms really for target practice and duck hunting? Scientific American says one in six Americans are on psych drugs: the very drugs the mainstream media profits from every day. Is there a connection between Big Pharma’s product and mass shootings, or are guns the problem? What destruction would a world government do if this is what national governments do? Good Guys with Guns asks some hard questions. What can we the people do to deter tyranny and atrocities?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":96983,"logo_path":null,"name":"Matrixx Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-11-30","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Good Guys with Guns: How an Armed Citizenry Deters Tyranny and Atrocities","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
