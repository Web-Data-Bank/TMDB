Taste the silken tofu, the creamy soy milk, the crispy bean curd! It just has one reprehensible flaw: no flaws! The lack of a built-in-breakdown mechanism appalls the conglomerate’s two-man executive branch who resorts to a budget exorcism to solve their problem named Eric. Also under the axe is Fony TV 11’s ruthless host Rafflesia Pong (Jerrica Lai), whose speciality arts programme is overshadowed by an increasingly popular art form: reality TV. Determined to claw her way back to the top, she lands on a morbid concept that finds an ally in the divided product designer.","popularity":1.013,"poster_path":"/Apbi5MMrT0Gmy5ePyhETFGNcGUi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MY","name":"Malaysia"}],"release_date":"2009-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Malay","iso_639_1":"ms","name":"Bahasa melayu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Don't but me!","title":"Sell Out!","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":5}
