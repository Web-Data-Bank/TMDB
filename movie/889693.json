Believing that one of the best ways to get insight into a foreign culture is through the films of that country, the artist has adopted one of his favourite German films as his guide, The Bitter Tears of Petra von Kant (1972) by Rainer Werner Fassbinder, about a successful but arrogant fashion designer in her mid-thirties, who falls into despair when she loses the woman she loves.  Putting himself in the mould of German actress Margit Carstensen as Petra Von Kant – a role for which she won several awards – the artist attempts to articulate himself through as wide a range of emotions as displayed by the actress in the climactic scene from the film, where our tragic lovesick anti-heroine goes through a hysterical disintegration.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dzbXj8nM4oUoNstXVb4ZK3x0dIa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-05-16","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Learn German With Petra Von Kant","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
