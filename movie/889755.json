They are however Syrian-Lebanese and live in 2021 in a European city on the shore of the Mediterranean. When they meet for the frst time at the bufet of the ferry terminal, they engage in a conversation without introduction. What follows is a series of unexpected meetings and unforeseen discussions in which everyday life and political considerations, the individual and the general, are approached sometimes with irony mixed with melancholy, and other times with the play of paradox. On the backdrop of the so-called «migration crisis in Europe», Fadi and Rami freely discuss a variety of topics. Their of-the-cuf exchanges often come back to the cause of their exile: the post-colonial war. Exile, as we know, sharpens the mind. With dialectic and humor, they chat about all kinds of things.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dialogues of Exile","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
