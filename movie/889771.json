This year, a show of acrobatic stunts is the apotheosis, and especially Amédée and Niki’s show, two 26-year old twins, who have created a particularly perilous figure. In the middle of the jump, Amédée realizes that Niki is not there to catch her, and falls dangerously in front of the audience.

Little by little, climatic disturbances invade the island in an increasingly violent crescendo.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":360,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Stuntwoman","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
