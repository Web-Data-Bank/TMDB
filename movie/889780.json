When I watched them, I realized that he had a comprehensive video diary, that he is a lover of images, and that he recorded everything as if he had been mandated by a public administrator to create memories. I see myself surrounded by them in his archives. They are my uncles, cousins and grandfathers – all policemen. My childhood with my family was surrounded by the PDI, Chile’s investigative police. Guns, badges, uniforms, gunshots. Almost all the men in my family are policemen. I look at my uncle’s images, at these ordinary men, even though I don’t know what that means. The story, the archives, the future, the violence and the police. Men and police as an inescapable relationship to think about.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":150159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Transparaíso","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CL","name":"Chile"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"I’ll Never be a Cop","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
