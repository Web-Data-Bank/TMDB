After the ideological revolution of 1979, those who considered cinema as a degenerate art collected some copies of fiction films and set them on fire. As a result, the history of Iranian cinema is silently buried, unnoticed. Tehran, as the location for most Iranian films, is the best history witness of such actualities. This project is a cinematic, anthropological discovery, and an anthology of the history of Iranian cinema.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tehran, City of Ambitions","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
