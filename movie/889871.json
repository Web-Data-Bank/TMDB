At that time, the communists, currently three million people, built 750,000 bunkers. The bunkers are everywhere: in cities, yards, cemeteries and playgrounds across the country. After communism, the bunkers were used in different ways by the albanian citizens: they became pizzerias, bars, museums and hostels. The bunkers are used symbolically in the film, to report what is left of the communist dictatorship.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jCk3XVKKWNtmfW99jzvaNNsEiys.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sigurimi","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
