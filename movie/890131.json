A woman breaks free of her monotonous daily routine tending to her husband by escaping into her garden; its sensual pleasures evident in her minutely-observed expressions of delight. The garden’s sights and sounds offer welcome distraction as do the attentions of her neighbour.  This winsome, dialogue-free film celebrates the often-overlooked sensuality of older women.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fumbling Towards Ecstasy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
