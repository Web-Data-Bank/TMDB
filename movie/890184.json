In an industrial urban landscape, two women are engaged in conversation when they are interrupted by the arrival of a third woman. The new woman greets the older of the two, apparently her friend, while ignoring the other. She then whispers an urgent message in her friend's ear, further isolating the other woman. With an underlying awkwardness, introductions are made and pleasantries exchanged between the three.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uMNm1etVxAk2a73ymeGTU18mn4w.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Greeting","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
