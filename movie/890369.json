Locating herself within the local trans community, the documentary also weaves in interviews with different generations of trans women including ‘Anita’, a former legend of Bugis Street—a world-famous stomping ground for trans women in the 1950s to the ’80s—and Lune LOH, a trans youth activist.","popularity":0.863,"poster_path":"/6fmsxGB6kFcUoSFKgUKOdKsXIAv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126768,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tiger Tiger Pictures","origin_country":"SG"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"2021-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Some Women","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
