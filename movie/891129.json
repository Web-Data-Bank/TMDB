Historically, the city's mariquitas (\"sissies\") have also assimilated them in their childhood and,  through them, have been creating their own encounter spaces and their own codes.  Nowadays, new dissident identities continue to respond to them: they participate or distance  themselves, they continue what exists or transform it. This film looks at these traditions from a  perspective always relegated to the margins.","popularity":0.671,"poster_path":"/Af2fHOszDJy2hWfknbQGRWUPKDe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"2022-05-20","revenue":0,"runtime":109,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Queer stories in Seville's Holy Week","title":"¡Dolores guapa!","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
