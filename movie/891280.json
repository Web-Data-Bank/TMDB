As an homage to the great fairy tales of the past, “How To Raise a Black Boy” opens with the cover of a book, intricately carved in wood with a boy and a man on either side. “I remember home, or at least I can imagine it.” This is the voice of narrator Rayceen Pendarvis of the iconic voguing House of Pendarvis, known to many as “Mother”. The narrator is an omniscient presence, a fairy godmother, who speaks as one of the boys.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dgZfUfEoMCMsgUZuR0LgOZwRThk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Four Black boys disappear one night, as many Black boys do, and find themselves on a fantastical journey to break the curses of Black boyhood.","title":"How to Raise a Black Boy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
