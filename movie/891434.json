From the bulk of this sometimes memorable and sometimes forgotten work, Sylvain L’Espérance provides a thoughtful compilation that highlights the complex, troubled, and often violent relationship between humans and animals. The masterful editing presents a sprawling network imbued with meaning, letting the images speak for themselves and interact freely with each other. With this fascinating film, L’Espérance continues a cinematic exploration that opens up new avenues in his work. Despite a tendency toward abstraction, the filmmaker seems increasingly anchored in reality, showcasing an admirably lucid creativity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iAaEjFlTt2oesW77mw1Cb8IYyqf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2021-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Animal macula","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1}
