They suffer from starvation, risk a brutal beat-up if caught, or if lucky, they swim to regain freedom. They become the hungry wandering living-ghosts. After the war, locals have more or less witnessed the miners’ ghosts that remain wandering about, as if they were still the poor souls that lost direction.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kpoD57Nroqob1ZGr8bnwVTrqtcN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2021-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Green Grass, Pale Fire","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
