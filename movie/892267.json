The first part of the DVD is a shoot interview that sees Raven talk about his feud vs. CM Punk in ROH. Raven uses the famous angle he did at \"Death Before Dishonor\" with CM Punk and Tommy Dreamer as an example of how to execute angles. Raven dissects this angle and tells the importance of every movement and ring positioning. Raven then discusses some of his favorite angles and why they worked. He includes his favorite angles from Bill Watts UWF as well as a surprising WWE angle from the early 90s. Raven really gives insight on why these storylines worked and how to execute an angle.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/AizPOcDnGSskm51BrOM65vr6mtM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":122,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Straight Shootin' & Angle Psychology","title":"Secrets of The Ring w/ Raven Vol. 5","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
