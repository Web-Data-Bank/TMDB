The public and ever younger children are being groomed to collude in the increasing militarisation of UK society.  Interweaving the powerful and moving testimonies of veterans of Britain’s unbroken century of wars with expert commentary, archive and a redolent score, War School’s mosaic of sound and imagery evokes the story of the child soldier who becomes a peace campaigner, challenging the myth of Britain's benign role in world affairs and asking if perpetual war is really what we want for future generations?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8gnghAWmknGVXMvGzbigSqq7cyu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"They said it was ‘the war to end all wars’","title":"War School: The Battle for Britain’s Children","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
