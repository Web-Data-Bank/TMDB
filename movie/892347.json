Six lives defined by their own rhythm that make the city flourish. This is the cinematic result of the sum of images and emotions. An organic creation of the ‘Bilbao’ concept. Being from Bilbao implies conveying through emotions why Bilbao is a wonderful city in which we live, feel, work, love, share and coexist.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pride","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
