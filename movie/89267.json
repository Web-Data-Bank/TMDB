Trying to understand that she won't be able to see the familiar building from her apartment in New York anymore and afraid of getting on a plane, she sets off for a road trip that is therapy and art performance in one. She has six weeks to get back to New York, and she spends them driving through a country in shock and talking to people she meets along the way. All of them share a strange sadness - not only about the attacks - and a surprising willingness to open their hearts and lives to this young woman with a camera. And by taking us on a trip through her country, she ends up leading us into the very soul of it.","popularity":0.681,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Parallel Lines","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":3}
