This work is a hybrid of filmed performance, CGI animation and sound art. It draws on Chinese myth and a sense of belonging from an Asian queer diasporic perspective.  ‘you must everywhere wander 你必顧盼’ is a meeting point of transgressive queer desire, a dream homeland and reality. We are what we eat, we are what we remember, we are what we believe.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/seYT2seC9MXvl4Hk6OM5bPzT3nv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"you must everywhere wander","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
