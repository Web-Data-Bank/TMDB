So we start from there, research, we find something or we do not find anything. We use the plans in their entirety, the images recorded there or elsewhere are deprived of their meaning. They are reconstructed in the overall movement of the film which is summed up (condenses) to its technical characteristics: S8 colors, 18 fps, 8mn, magnetic track lying down. The sense / sense that takes place here for 8 minutes is only the sum / combination of random elements having their own weight but which cancel each other out / add to each other / divide / multiply each other.
