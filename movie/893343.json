Looking for Barbara is an experimental film that explores the relationship to the individual personal archive found in every home.

Set to a backdrop of the filmmaker’s personal archive in the form of Super 8 footage from the 1990s, Looking for Barbara is a short documentary essay which explores the role and significance of the queer personal archive.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Looking for Barbara","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
