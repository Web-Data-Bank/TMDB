Its lyrics are in five languages, which are reflected in the film. But what does it mean if you don’t understand your own national anthem?, one of the students wonders. He can speak the language of the Queen, but not of his own grandmother, and laments that his grandfather felt like a foreigner in his own country.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fG22mClxY8j5KalVCCHX7JkUg7u.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sikelela Tapes","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
