Roaming from job to shelter, from woman to woman, he discovers that living honestly is a lot more difficult than just stealing something every once in a while. In 1989, filmmaker Helena Třeštíková started filming the then 18-year-old delinquent, ultimately resulting in the 2008 film René, which follows his life inside and outside prison. This sequel to that film begins with the premiere of René and the ensuing storm of media attention.","popularity":0.636,"poster_path":"/y6a68dl2fftyAzcxWCHBks5EvZ9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4595,"logo_path":null,"name":"Negativ","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2022-04-07","revenue":0,"runtime":102,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"René – The Prisoner of Freedom","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
