In the 1950s, the poet began to merge public with personal history. Following the lead of the so-called confessional poets, his own style shifted from densely textured formalism to the more open structures and autobiographical subject matter that would characterize a great deal of American poetry to the present day.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gvVTdYsjpVl5G1ghW9snvZMGdDp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Voices & Visions: Robert Lowell","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
