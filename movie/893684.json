From the writing to the line, from the story to the color, through the influences, the film restores the creation in progress and opens the doors of the universe to the tormented aesthetics of a man who knew how to impose his style and lift the borders between comics, cinema and contemporary art. Enki Bilal literally reveals the conception of the second part of his album Bug, in which he depicts a future world paralyzed by a computer bug. Between memory and transmission, he draws the past and sketches the future - And his drawing is breathtakingly beautiful.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cfgRUcDExXDXf3UwdpeSNhvk6lG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Enki Bilal, souvenirs du futur","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
