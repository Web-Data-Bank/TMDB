The plutonium in the bombs carried by the B-52 was spread over a wide area, and today it still lies buried 20 feet underground, surrounded by desert landscapes and fenced enclosures. This has major health implications for the local people, including filmmaker Camila Moreiras. The Spanish landscape and Moreiras’s body come together in parallel stories of recovery and survival—land and body alike must adapt, whatever the cost.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sZRBDospbtqwk9kvRFdnzVX3C8G.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sine die","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
