DNA exists in the cells of all living organisms and contains an incalculable amount of information necessary for life. Evolutionary interpretations have led to the incorrect beliefs that mutations and natural selection are responsible for adding the information necessary for molecules-to-man evolution and that \"junk\" DNA is merely a leftover from this process. This DVD will explore the fascinating world of DNA and clearly show that \"junk\" DNA isn't junk and that mutations and natural selection are headed in the wrong direction, corrupting and decreasing information in DNA making evolution impossible. The origin of such diversity and variability could only be the God of the Bible!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7UxzHzxRnai3pYiZUe7ChckHOJB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Dissects the evidence found in DNA for clues to its origin and finds that the processes touted by evolutionists are greatly embellished.","title":"The Code of Life: DNA, Information, and Mutation","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
