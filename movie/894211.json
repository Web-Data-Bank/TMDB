Jan Marcin Szancer, an outstanding graphic designer and book illustrator, was the author of the script and the art concept. He was a person present in the Polish film industry since the interwar years. The main animator of Mrs. Twardowska was Witold Giersz, the future master of animation. The fluidity of movement and the grace of the characters, similar to the ones in The Goat Kid, evoke associations with Disney films. This beautiful film proves the creative possibilities and ambitious attitude of the Polish animation community a few years after the war.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tA5vi7mN8cXyWaOAaV5dOZTCQSy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":157563,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Filmów Rysunkowych (Bielsko-Biała)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1955-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mrs. Twardowska","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
