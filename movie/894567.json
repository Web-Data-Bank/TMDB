Asmik Grigorian as Jenůfa in her Covent Garden debut and Karita Mattila as the Kostelnička lead a star cast with Hungarian conductor Henrik Nánási conducting a stunning score infused with traditional folk melodies of Janáček’s native Moravia. Claus Guth’s acclaimed staging - both elegant and open while being utterly claustrophobic and oppressive - captures the great humanity at the heart of the opera.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sY9XrqxxkpAs8VoYmfUP0kEdf8c.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jenůfa - ROH","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
