The Cinéma Arvor, a temple of art and independent film, is spending its last hours in its emblematic building with its five columns and pink neon sign. The Arvor will move into a modern glass tower, next to the EuroRennes train station. The cinema will expand from two theaters to five and enjoy greater programming freedom. Putting financing together does not run smoothly; delays pile up on the construction site. Nothing out of the ordinary, until the pandemic throws the schedule into disarray yet again. The directors shadowed the Arvor team for more than two years. As cinephiles, they make this history an ode to art and independent film and share their love of the theater as a place of communication, encounter, and extraordinary shared experiences of cinema on the big screen.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3NQJDYGpjH4AfEbJbAUuMelISYC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20720,"logo_path":null,"name":"TVR Rennes 35 Bretagne","origin_country":""},{"id":144414,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tebeo","origin_country":""},{"id":144415,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tebesud","origin_country":""},{"id":310,"logo_path":"/4Gp5A4YdjPBfsHT47ngHMaXWmb9.png","name":"CNC","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Arvor de 2 à 5","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
