I only know her from old family photos and visits to her grave. Nevertheless, she was a present part of my life. I fantasized about her and was convinced I was her reincarnation. I thought a lot about whether I would meet the same fate as her - a death at a young age from a brain tumor. My film tells what my sister meant to me, my brothers and my parents, and what her death triggered in us.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Desired Child","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
