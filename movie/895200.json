Harriet is 17, a misfit rich kid, star of her high school cross-country team, but currently, refusing to cross the finish line. She lies to her friends. She fakes suicide. It’s all a deflection – her only parent is on his deathbed and she can't say goodbye. Combine that with the looming reality that her acid-tongued half-sister will soon be her only family, this is one of those times in life when you decide who you are. Someone who faces up or someone who runs away. Then she finds a hair in her jello. Her best friend calls her a coward. A bird craps on her head. Something shifts.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sucking Wind","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
