This is a strategic zone controlled by various armies in the midst of a region that awaits reconstruction. The film stems from the simple question of how to tell the story of a country of which the West is deprived of images. Both fiction and documentary, it is about reality and the means of telling it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lBe8R7uPzqrle8rpMqpsN3wqfR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":61201,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anna Sanders Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":68065,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fondation de France","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2000-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":74,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le pont du trieur","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
