It does so in a way that is observational, introspective and personal given our own relations to space, routines and urban loneliness. The mundanity of these acts highlights an absurdity in the city life routines we take for granted. The people and the city itself become characters in a narrative of the last things we do before going home to rest.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The last thing you do before you go home.","title":"Tomato Sauce Takeaway","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
