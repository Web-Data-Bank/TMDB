Rocco was responsible for the very first gay films that were shown openly to the paying public in the late 1960s. Situated before hardcore porn became the norm, and in marked contrast to the somewhat darker gay porn that was coming out of New York at the time. Pat Roccoâ€™s film were more sun-dappled, featuring tanned and happy-looking naked men on sail boats and on beaches, celebrating their identities and the beauty of the male body. The filmmakers got to talk to the generous, rather humble and open-minded Rocco just before his death. It took a team of dedicated Canadian filmmakers to capture a fairly obscure moment of indie film history that deserves to be remembered.","popularity":0.655,"poster_path":"/nO0qLY8LNorFl4XnRM0CINJytrl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-12-02","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pat Rocco Dared","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
