In his compelling portrait, Jonas Grosch shows a man who simply cannot stand still if he senses injustice. The courage to stand up for one’s beliefs coupled with vanity? However one chooses to look at it, it is easy to imagine what made him connect with the \"RAF\". With his irrepressible will for freedom, Christof Wackernagel gets entangled in the horrors of day-to-day life in Africa.","popularity":0.622,"poster_path":"/175Qgb77jbUDLJjW4VFdoDm1t2E.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2544,"logo_path":null,"name":"Doni Doni Film","origin_country":""},{"id":2545,"logo_path":null,"name":"MMM Film GmbH","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2007-01-13","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bambara","iso_639_1":"bm","name":"Bamanankan"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"White Man with Black Bread","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
