She then meets Kadir (Kadir), an honest but unlucky young man, who has come to Jakarta with his younger brother, Doyok (Doyok Sudarmadji), to try their fortune. Failing, Doyok returns alone to his village. Kadir also goes home to the village, but with Fifi. But as a city person from a rich family, she is not used to the village life. Kadir keeps working for her, such as selling frogs, which is a mistake as the frogs he sells are not edible. The inedible frog becomes a big joke. Finally, Kadir and Fifi return to the city just when Fifi is going to be engaged to Tomo (Rudy Salam), her parentsâ€™ intended. But Fifi is already in love with Kadir. Kadir leaves because he does not want to be insulted, but Fifi goes after him and runs away from home.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8k6iByy4zFNho01w7uDwBhQV8Z5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":162511,"logo_path":"/un8lguFbahqfdLARR1KZI5jfQWJ.png","name":"PT Rapi Film","origin_country":"ID"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"1989-07-17","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Makelar Kodok","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
