When history distorts the truth.  When my (her)story meets another (her)story.  When women disappear without a trace.  When, white and privileged, I attend a rehearsal of stories.  When violence done to women’s bodies equals the violence done by words.  The bodies of those we don’t want to see or hear.  From my studio window, I look out and my life intersects with theirs.  In Winnipeg there are those who Win, generally the whites. There are the nips, the name given to Asian immigrants (the Latinos included in the insult)  And everyone walks on EGG shells.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xm8opa7vj7NyZd4FEZEu72x204g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":164085,"logo_path":null,"name":"Groupe Intervention Vidéo (GIV)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"WIN-NIP-EGG","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
