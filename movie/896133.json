Sosso and Alice Knowland), who run a general store. They somehow manage to save up enough money to send Becky away to boarding school. The other girls come from very wealthy families and Becky allows them to believe that she comes from a rich family, too. One of her classmates invites her to her home, where she meets Tom Fielding (Jack Holt), a young doctor. He falls in love with Becky, and she never gets the opportunity to tell him the truth about her background.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ptOPqFB1514tv5SYg3LzsXBxTXq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37554,"logo_path":null,"name":"Oliver Morosco Photoplay Company","origin_country":""},{"id":4,"logo_path":"/gz66EfNoYPqHTYI4q9UEN4CbHRc.png","name":"Paramount","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1917-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Giving Becky a Chance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
