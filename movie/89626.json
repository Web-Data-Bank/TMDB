While an animated cast of animal “spirit guides” quote Philip Larkin’s poem, This Be the Verse, and implore us to “get out as early as you can” from life and our parents’ grasp, a hunter dreams of a zoo where he might lie next to tranquilized animals calmed of their savagery. A senile and unstable God stumbles, forgets to take his medication, and turns frost into diamonds. Beauty Plus Pity contemplates the shame and beauty of existence; it is part apologia, part call to arms.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bWoxn9sGIuj5mAT6Mj8nykpFZ7S.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beauty Plus Pity","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
