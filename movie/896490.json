Shot using a tiny, pocket sized digital camera. \"I initially didn't intend to make a video from them or have them shown publicly. I was just making a diary of moments that I found graceful during the frequent downtime that occurs when traveling. My partner, Abigail Smith, created a large collection of field recordings during this same time, some of which were later published under the title \"Indochina Soundscraps\". And although the two projects stand-alone, I think they compliment each other in attitude and approach - which works well as a metaphor for our relationship.\"","popularity":0.607,"poster_path":"/qEhWrJXs1hm5I7dA3i4opBj5RBC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-07-22","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"easy to learn hard to forget","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
