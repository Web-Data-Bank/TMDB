She moves and meets new people, argues, plays sports, goes to an amusement park - As she wanders through the sunny summer of 1996, she grows, changes and blossoms. This fully independent film is Alexandre Lavigne's first feature. It is made entirely from grainy video footage, steeped in a nostalgic 1990s aesthetic. There is a disconcerting intimacy here, with privileged, almost secret, access to deeply private thoughts and a bygone time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6XcordowhvwNqPog8Yw38s9VuUh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Carnaval","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
