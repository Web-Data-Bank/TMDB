The film wishes to investigate a potential contemporary condition of suspension in which western-society has fallen into. The artist by assembling a unique optical device has explored the microscopic dimension of billboard paper and projected it back onto its given urban environments.  The result is an atmospheric work in which the micro confronts the macro in a sequence of urban projections where by means of juxtaposition of perspectives reality results as partially suspended.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Milano di carta","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":2}
