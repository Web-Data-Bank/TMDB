What starts out as teen shenanigans (a porn stash is accrued with the five-finger discount) turns unsettling as a beating is doled out by Dad as punishment. The contrast between the naive voice and what is seen on screen - shot in hand-held close ups - is something unforgettable.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Teach You a Lesson","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
