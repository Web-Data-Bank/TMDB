Today, the industrial warehouse lies empty in a vast and abandoned dock landscape.  The expressive space portrayed in the film is inhabited by an enigmatic figure that, in terms of its scale and appearance, seems to live in a symbiosis with the building and its site.  Left Behind offers a mysterious \"vision\" of a warehouse that is today a \"shadow of itself\". The short film circles around the themes of presence/absence, empty landscapes, beauty/grace and, by demonstrating that the site is not as \"left behind\" as perhaps thought, offers a hopeful glimpse into the future of its development.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Left Behind","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
