It depicts a love story occurring in the dream of Du Liniang, the heroine, which integrates the legendary and the reality. The unique dream of Du, over 600 years as it has gone through, now comes to you in the form of stop-motion animation with its subtle emotion revealed more vividly in the haunting tune and lingering sentiments of Kunqu Opera. We try to rejuvenate the long-lasting love story by the special charm of stop-motion animation. On the table-sized stage, you will see the joint dancing of Du and Flower Goddesses, and the lively and joyful performance of the hell-world judge and ghosts. Entering into the dream along with Du, we, in turn, introspect ourselves on the meaning of the real life, and pursue eternal freedom and romantic love.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/x7kX2RNAZgDnmXnS6x5iubiyU8y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Peony Pavilion","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
