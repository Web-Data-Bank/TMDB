With the excuse of a casting, the filmmakers appropriate the theater and the inhabitants of the place arrive, revealing little by little some lives embraced by the aura of the poet, who died in Paris seventy years ago. All of them, inhabitants and filmmakers, are confused between verses, stories and poetry. Fantasy emerges and characters like the blind Santiago-who rings the bells always warning something-; or the young musician Elder - whose desires loom like a cornucopia-trace a liminal path between fiction and reality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nbjRW5fqN8zR3Hc3nYZpzlfljSB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121930,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mercado Central","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PE","name":"Peru"}],"release_date":"2021-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"About Everything There Is to Know","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
