Wives and husbands, mothers and fathers, sons and daughters maneuver their way through mourning as death takes loved ones and life insists on moving forward. Here, letting go is a challenge for both the dead and the living. The people of this city share the same world, but don't always know when they live in each other's lives, helping and harming each other. Connected by friendship, proximity, and blood, they both destroy and support each other. Through weddings, funerals, murders, forgiveness, love, new birth, and sacrifice, the living build community and hope. Meanwhile, the souls of the dead linger to watch over loved ones.","popularity":0.653,"poster_path":"/cgGRjxtrAQZvxr59Py3JCDMlSgu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":179548,"logo_path":null,"name":"HAK Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-07-27","revenue":0,"runtime":136,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Collapsed Walls","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
