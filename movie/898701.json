Beck betrays the apparent effortlessness of the original clips by editing them alongside the numerous rehearsals, variously self-conscious and obsessive, they required. With inter-titles and voice-over, Beck recapitulates his performances according to the video technology he used to produce them. As a result, the body, in its correlation with the evolution and obsolescence of technology, is revealed as a purely “enjoying” substance. Whether portraying a vindictive martyr in Bigmouth Strikes Again, a suicidal loner in Panic, or a comatose drag queen in Girlfriend In A Coma, Beck brings the violence and malice implicit in lead-singer Morrissey’s lyrics graphically to life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-10-15","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nine Years Later (\"Girlfriend in a Coma\")","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
