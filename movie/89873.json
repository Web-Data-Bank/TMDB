Brazen forgeries and impersonations branded the white collar crime spree remarkable. \"Unraveled\" is set in the purgatory of house arrest -- an Upper East Side penthouse -- where the Court has ordered Dreier confined until his sentencing day. The film weaves Dreier's struggle to prepare for the possibility of life imprisonment with first-person flashbacks, which reveal his audacious path of destruction. Destroyed by his own hubris, Dreier attempts to grasp his tragic unraveling. With unprecedented access, \"Unraveled\" exposes a mastermind of criminal deception.","popularity":1.786,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-04-13","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An Ambitious Man, An Immoral Plan.","title":"Unraveled","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":10}
