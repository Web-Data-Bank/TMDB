In hopes of touching the warmth of these moments, we keep them nearby like cherished novels in the bookshelves of our minds. All Together Now is the concert doc reimagined. Akin to our mind’s eye, the film approaches documentation with an abandon for linear history. We don’t witness an evening from the past so much as feel its gravity. Beautiful and abstracted concert footage from Dan Mangan’s 2019 homecoming show at Vancouver’s historic Vogue Theatre is artfully woven within the narrative, philosophy and context of what it means to be in concert with people.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ulGRU5daYCOy07MF97Kt7Fpiji8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All Together Now","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
