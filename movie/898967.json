Everyone here knows each other, and almost everything about each other. Everything here is like under a magnifying glass. The patriarchal way of life has changed little in recent years with technical progress. The old and the new. Everything here that is ugly bulges out with a vengeance, but the good things also do not go unnoticed. This film is a parable: a story about Russia, about the customs that prevail in the modern village.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/g66CTHfYq5T2mkHJLuSfEewNXSJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2021-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"After the Deluge","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
