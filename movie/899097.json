But his mother, cautions her son to go slow and use care, for misfortune may be just around the corner. When the son tires of his mother's lectures, he leaves from home, dashing off into the desert. Meanwhile, a heinous villain enters the picture, and he uses Mother Donkey as a beast of burden. The little donkey comes back years later to find his mother missing. When the donkey learns what has happened, he dives into action, using his irrational behavior to find his mother. Then, using his superior speed and strength, he gives the miscreant a sound trouncing, thus liberating his beloved mother. The short ends happily with mother and son basking in familial bliss, and Mother Donkey reluctantly acknowledging that extreme caution is not always the only path to righteousness.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1941-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Streamlined Donkey","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
