In this fantastical village, a puppeteer manipulates the characters in a kind of shadow play that seems to be activated by musicians and actors. The film poses multiple political questions about justice, self-defense, politics and migration. Amorales’ visual vocabulary confronts us with these topics as he suggests that our vision of the world is shaped by pre-existing languages and social codes.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La Aldea Maldita","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
