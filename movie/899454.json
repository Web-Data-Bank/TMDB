April Flowers, his much younger-looking best friend, is worried that they may never see each other again. Written by Melissa Monet, this is the story, told vignette-style, of the ups and downs of their relationship over a period of several years, during which Randy gets married, has a couple of kids, and gets divorced, and April experiments with lesbian love, takes up with kinky Eric Masterson, and dumps him when she catches him screwing around with the couple next door. It’s the story of two best friends who go their separate ways only to wind up together again, unattached, and mature enough to finally admit their love for one another.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aUlW2a9e6ICD9jDuoz6S1u6SrbS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7840,"logo_path":"/pXHXO1qKuQEDv8NDvoNmSaV4gvi.png","name":"Wicked Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sometimes what you're looking for is right in front of you","title":"Best Friends","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
