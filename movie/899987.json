Almost 150 degrees of the circumscribed fisheye. Because the fisheye lens replaces the hemisphere of the field of view with a flat surface, the image becomes circular, creating a centre and periphery. Using this as a metaphor for the structure of the world, the film is a statement of the artist's thoughts. The music is borrowed from Mayumi Gorin and T. REX's album. Produced in 1975. The artist was 40 years old.
