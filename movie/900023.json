The film follows the trajectory of Shirley Krenak and Maria Zelzuita, women who are at the forefront of the struggle for land in Brazil. Shirley brings the mission of honoring the women and wisdom of the Krenak warriors, from the region of Minas Gerais. Maria Zelzuita is one of the survivors of the Eldorado dos Carajás Massacre, in Pará, and her trajectories connect us to the concept of violence and the appropriation of the female body.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1AHVyjmjJKUIjryArHFWKoYCWpS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2021-11-06","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Guarani","iso_639_1":"gn","name":""},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Mãe de Todas as Lutas","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
