In a study carried out by the Beatriz Lassalle Graduate School of Social Work of the University of Puerto Rico with the Center for Dominican Women, a sample of 900 women showed that 97% of said population are victims of emotional violence, 81% of physical abuse and 78% sexual abuse. Despite multiple violence, being victims of a system that oppresses them for being undocumented immigrants, women, Dominicans, and black, the narratives contain the stubbornness to live fully and to ensure a better future for themselves, their children and their children and the communities to which they belong in their countries of origin and in Puerto Rico.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pC1Hm2B1ScezyLx6OHyMA5v2F0L.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Desempacando: Género, Migración y Violencia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
