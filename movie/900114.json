Mastering the difficult art of spin bowling after being kicked out of football for not being a good enough player proved a pivotal choice for 19 year old Shane – declared unfit and fat, he transformed himself.  When success came, so did fame and adulation, money and prestige but a betting scandal, drugs scandal, and affairs that cost him his marriage, threatened his career. From the lows of a 12 month ban he rebuilt his cricket, his career, and his reputation as one of the most ferocious competitors on the planet, admired and revered by millions.","popularity":2.233,"poster_path":"/p7U7yB7gBwVzlPKTEMLRCTcLgOL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":156114,"logo_path":null,"name":"EQ Media Group","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":166157,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eclipse Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":166158,"logo_path":null,"name":"Gospel","origin_country":""},{"id":7584,"logo_path":"/eGkfvvyf4fJTvBUR1xt1669IPA3.png","name":"Screen Australia","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2022-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":96,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The king of spin.","title":"Shane","video":false,"vote_average":6.143,"vote_count":6}
