At once deeply personal, carefully veiled in a delicate fabric of pure emotions, and absolutely immersive in its dreamlike, mysterious beauty, 'The Dark Forest' transmutes its author's innermost life into an admirable piece of introspective cinema. Opening with Dante Alighieri's quote which inspired the title, it takes the viewer on a short, yet transcendent journey through the bushes of symbols and trees of thoughts, in the company of a lovely (and cunning?) forest spirit embodied by Carly Erin O'Neil whose poise and grace translate as otherworldly.\" â€”Nikola Gocic","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/v4LRgnHRybzqlSMGwu5Jm6NgJvP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dark Forest","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
