Meena is married. Chandiran loves Pankajam. His father and grandmother want him to marry a relative girl, Thangam, who is very helpful to the family. But Chandiran marries Pankajam defying them. Although brought in for comic relief, the ever-loveable J. P. Chandrababu and his milkman character became the real irresistible pull of this family melodrama. Director A. Bhimsingh—a rare talent to have successes in both South Indian and Hindi cinemas—masterfully blends lightness and pathos.","popularity":0.841,"poster_path":"/oNexPZNwDgBBFruoOXk5pLB0Itc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1959-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":175,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tamil","iso_639_1":"ta","name":"தமிழ்"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sahodari","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
