Having been met at the door by Sally’s shotgun toting brother—Jews not welcome here—Matt takes refuge in a Victorian folly of a boathouse on the nearby river, where Sally finds him. Cue moonlight and music (waltz, please), willows and woods. Can one enchanted evening change the course of two lives? Once upon a time—there was hope in the land.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oSpk029j6E2REHqJRcuGuuTvUaD.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":164910,"logo_path":null,"name":"Syracuse Stage","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Talley's Folly","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
