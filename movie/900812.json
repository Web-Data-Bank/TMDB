It is illustrated by individual scenes with actors in leather costumes (the author's creations), which restrict their movement and thus already emphasize the separation of man from nature. The last trace of connection - the ritual relationship between man and bull, which is again based on human cruelty to animals - ends with blood, which on a symbolic level also pervades the whole image.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qP0SW6k6GQLhgIsWljBd7PajXTC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":164942,"logo_path":null,"name":"V.
