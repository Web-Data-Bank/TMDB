The viewer enters a dark atmosphere dictated by dramatic vocal-electronic music, passing anthropomorphic and waxy zoomorphic figures, and camera movements. When the author establishes the landscape, she places a wrestler and a drowning woman in it, and with these scenes she further increases the suspension. At the height of the dramaturgy, the set stage collapses. The waxen guard dogs dissolve and the soldiers retreat. Naked female characters appear, announcing the transition to a period of warmth and peace, accompanied by softer music.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vyyucef4BLU1qcyMnlx7QHGxSSw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33168,"logo_path":null,"name":"Forum Ljubljana","origin_country":"SI"},{"id":48428,"logo_path":null,"name":"VPK","origin_country":"SI"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Taiga","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
