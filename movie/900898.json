When viewed from above, we have an objectively distinguishable idea of a line, a pattern or an ornament.  In a labyrinth, we fall under the visual impact of a particular configuration of space, which it is impossible to get out of, being stuck in the disorientation affect. We switch to a subjective perception of life.  As we move continuously, the perception of the labyrinth space changes every second. Squares, streets, passages, corridors, rooms form a dynamic structure of the urban labyrinth, while going through which we are influenced by numerous constantly changing images.  The film represents an attempt to combine the architectural fantasy of a labyrinth and the visual experience of walking through over time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fcL8k6XuDPdubsoTGWU7GjAplrm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":164958,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Schwitalla","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2021-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Labyrinth","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
