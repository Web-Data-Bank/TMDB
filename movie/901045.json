Robert Wiene's film became the starting point and climax of the expressionist film. No work succeeded in surpassing the unique, grotesquely unreal and dreamlike style. 100 years later \"Cesare's Dream\" offers an interpretation of this extraordinary film as a walk-through VR experience with the help of the innovative technique of volumetric video. In this homage, holograms and virtual environments enable viewers to walk between the actors and scenery and experience a classic of the silent cinema in a completely new way.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vWQ57znwmteeN6SOUFFgAFVLjAF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-11-05","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cesare's Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
