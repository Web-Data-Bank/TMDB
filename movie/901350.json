That is the lesson to be learned from this animated film. It begins with a confrontation between a man who grows flowers and a technologist who operates computers. A flower pops up in the computer room; a computer tape appears in the garden. Each man destroys the \"foreign object.\" When they come face to face they discover that understanding is better than distrust, respect better than hostility.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uTpbV98IwgJDgrtl2hBI5LtXqm1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1972-08-12","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Under the Rainbow","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
