The crew, locked out in a distant village, decide to shoot a film regardless of the conditions. They set out on a quest to find an actress from the locals while the producer reflects on his childhood in the village. The surreal stories of the first sexual experience, the childhood memories, a father beating his son, a dream with a bicycle and mister Bean, a wench excavating the field, a funeral, the bureaucracy of the government, new yearâ€™s eve, and mass prayers to counter the pandemic, compose a poem for a distant village.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Poem for a Distant Village","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
