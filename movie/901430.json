The documentary brings names like Carmen Serdán, Hermila Galindo, Dolores Jiménez Muro, Elvia Carrillo Puerto, Elena Arizmendi, Sara Pérez de Madero, to the front and recognizes their value in the formation of a nation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mujeres de la Revolución Mexicana","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
