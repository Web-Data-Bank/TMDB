Both were previously available on separate VHS releases. Shoot Your Shot is more dimly lit, but Divine really revs up the show toward the end, with the audience crowding the stage for the closing \"Love Reaction.\" Recorded nine months earlier, Live at the Hacienda is better lit and Divine is more animated throughout. Both concerts feature a hardworking, sweating Divine obscenely bantering with the audience. Both concerts are about 40 minutes and feature Divine performing \"Jungle Jezebel,\" \"Born to be Cheap,\" \"Alphabet Rap\" and more.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/h0iJvhHsRIAMWVD1uWb5kV7E5V.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4806,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cherry Red Records","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Divine: Shoot Your Shot & Live at the Hacienda","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
