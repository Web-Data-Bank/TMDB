The story centres on Tevye, the father of five daughters, and his attempts to maintain his Jewish religious and cultural traditions as outside influences encroach upon the family's lives. He must cope both with the strong-willed actions of his three older daughters, who wish to marry for love (each one's choice of a husband moves further away from the customs of their Jewish faith and heritage) and with the edict of the Tsar that evicts the Jews from their village.","popularity":0.609,"poster_path":"/8qyUd0Z4UFeE1sMrneaXs07Jdlq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-17","revenue":0,"runtime":148,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fiddler on the Roof","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
