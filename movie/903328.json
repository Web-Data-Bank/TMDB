This short film is made to raise more awareness about ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder). When I saw the struggle people with autism and their relatives go through--every day--I realized: if only people would be able to take a look inside the world of someone with autism, if only people would understand a little of what it really means for them, many judgments and dismissive actions towards people with autism, can be turned into motivating and stimulating actions. Understanding is the key for a change of behavior. It is my hope this film will create more of this understanding.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/AfmqND355Qpab0bQZU42tnHOxaz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-10-08","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"One boy - One toy - One battle.","title":"On Dragon's Wings","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
