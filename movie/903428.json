Few country devotees, be the old-timers or neophytes, are unfamiliar with the craggy Haggard mask of a thousand photographs.  His accomplishments rightly classify him as a living legend.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Merle Haggard: Alive & Fighting","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
