As the iron coil fixed to the inner part of the speaker vibrates back and forth, the piece of white paper flips up and down, as if it has a life of its own. This work demonstrates Imai’s desire to visualize the sound created by an inner organ that one is usually not conscious of hearing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Heart Beat","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
