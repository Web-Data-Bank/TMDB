While the videotape records his performance, he takes out one end of the open-reel video tape from the tape deck, staples his photograph directly on the videotape, and pins it on the wall until the videotape runs out completely. The still photographs of his face are attached to the loose bundles of videotape, which is a material record of the temporal duration of his performance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Self Portrait","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
