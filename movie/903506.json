In this informative new DVD, Georgia Purdom (PhD, molecular genetics) examines these arguments and shows why they are not evidence for common ancestry. Using non-technical language and illustrations, Dr. Purdom examines mitochondrial Eve, proposed human chromosome 2 fusion, ancient repetitive elements (AREs), gene duplication, and beneficial mutations to demonstrate that these “proofs” of evolution are nothing of the kind, but rather can easily be explained from a biblical worldview.
