Compromise has undermined the Bible, and the impact of this abandonment of belief in its authority is breaking like storm-driven waves on the shores of America. Once-thriving churches are being abandoned and transformed into dance studios, tattoo parlors, and nightclubs. Why?  In this illustrated presentation, apologist Ken Ham gives helpful insights into the reasons for this decline, which started with attacks on issues like the age of the earth and the accuracy of the history in Genesis. Ken shares how churches and individuals can stand against destructive, evolution-based ideas and successfully rebuild the foundation of biblical authority in our culture.
