In the evening, Guillaume tells stories to put them to sleep. On their holiday cruise along a canal, they meet several characters and have 'fun' with them each time - the woman lock keeper, a girl on a bike who plunges into the canal as she waves at them, a girl who hitches a lift from a bridge and a girl who seems to be a nun, until her black stockings and suspenders are revealed. Eventually, Martine brings M. Léon on board and the film ends with an orgy.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/ygaivirzQHlx4ebinbDIwVR0NjN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6211,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alpha France","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1980-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Croisières pour couples en chaleur","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
