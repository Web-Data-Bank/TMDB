Burning with jealousy, the Imperial Tutor's son (Siu Chung-kwan) frames Lee for treason, yet accidentally gets killed by Sit when she rescues Lee. To avenge his son's death, the Imperial Tutor tricks the couple into joining force in overthrowing the emperor and plans to accuse them of treason. Sit, who turns out to be the emperor's long-lost daughter, follows Lee to the palace for investigation. In the film, Tang Bik-wan put on various guises in her character, e.g. dressing as an ugly and Zhongshan dialect-speaking woman when she weds, disguising as a man while investigating. She proved herself a well-rounded diva with her marvellous singing, switching between different dialects and operatic styles. The scenes with Mak Bing-wing also show great chemistry, as the duo evolve from quarrelsome lovers to husband and wife.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":165283,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wai Kei","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1962-06-28","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Strange Lady Sit Yat-neung","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
