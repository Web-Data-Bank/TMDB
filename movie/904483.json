To make matters worse, all the food is starting to rebel. A fat earthworm escapes in a hurry, right under the mole's nose. The hunt inside the tunnels begins! Finally the earthworm is caught, but just as the mole is about to bite down, he realises that it's not an earthworm but another mole's tail. Now that they've found each other, there's a happy ending under the molehill.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zy4tZk7Lsvx59Jwv6ii3gFR2aGr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":124,"logo_path":"/7MjDMOybX0D3fcIEpCyY9es5XZU.png","name":"SWR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":73885,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Film Bilder","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":8707,"logo_path":"/2K2EDaP75Qz6Pr64SEsU6rbSDRC.png","name":"MFG Filmf√∂rderung","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Mole And The Earthworm","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
