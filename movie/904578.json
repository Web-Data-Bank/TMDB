One night, he frantically writes a short novel on a wine trip between France and Spain. His story goes unnoticed until a film producer decides to adapt it for cinema. This unexpected turn leads Thierry to pair with actor José Garcia, Joël Dupuch and a small film crew. Together, they will engage in an initiating wine trip to follow the map outlined in Thierry’s novel. With a half-broken vintage mini-cooper, a Don Quixote sculpture and 2,000 km of road, they will attempt to reach the Spanish region of La Mancha to bring Thierry’s novel to life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bgf3zvRojBiLrW0KQy2pPHxYg9T.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":71512,"logo_path":null,"name":"Waiting for Cinéma","origin_country":""},{"id":856,"logo_path":"/z0vTTWBhZggM09oZWSY3hbXgPKv.png","name":"Wild Bunch","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":127874,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sofica Manon 9","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2020-01-17","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Bottle","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
