The film explores the characters’ individual relationships with ancient forests, and why it’s imperative we collectively protect them. It touches on potential solutions, like a transition away from old-growth in the future of logging, and Indigenous sovereignty.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hGhLpiLFMh2juEwrhyTG0I0kxw9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Before They Fall","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
