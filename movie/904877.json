About how he was born without a father and mother, how he was hit by a snow lying on the oven in his hut, how he walked into the woods being a kid, and the miraculous things he had seen there. In his fantasies he could fly, make friends with birds, climb trees, and most importantly – do it all in infancy and without looking at anyone else. Based on poems by Stepan Rudanskyi.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/40Caa1LciMzB3h61Tb4kRHpyMV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19997,"logo_path":"/n1XHZgKeOC4GAGcLMAqQSr9Cchz.png","name":"Kyivnaukfilm","origin_country":"SU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Strange Thing","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
