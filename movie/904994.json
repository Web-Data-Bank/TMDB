Since his childhood, the villagers have called him whenever they’ve been plagued by illness and suffering. One day, when he is asked to heal a sick man, his healing powers no longer work. Neither his trance-like recitation of mantras nor the sacrifice of a rooster has any effect. The gods don’t hear him. Has he become too old to be a healer? In tranquil and contemplative images, AAKHAT tells the story of a shaman who is facing the end of his life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/d4PDzYWdXpCa70nhdCKZ88CU1YZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Nepali","iso_639_1":"ne","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Divination","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
