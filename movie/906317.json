Plastic forming turns them into abstract stains. The film begins with an inscription carved in the wall. It says ‘Later definitely there will be no camps, there will be no states, people will not kill themselves’. It explains the intent of the title. Modern people live in too much of a rush to remember this.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/icF1iJiNUQG1sjbYHqOWvgpu9qB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Definitely Later","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
