Now, Small Town Monsters launches their own investigation into the Mothman sightings that spread around Illinois, Indiana, and Michigan. Is the Mothman real? Seth Breedlove and Heather Moser pull at the threads of one of the most bizarre paranormal mysteries of the last decade. Along the way they interview witnesses, investigators, and even capture footage of a massive, winged being in downtown Chicago. What are people seeing? What does it mean? Is the Mothman simply an unidentified animal or a misidentified bird? Or is it something far more sinister? The truth is here, and the answers may shock you.","popularity":0.887,"poster_path":"/wdaCTrGZS6OzNJMzno9Nnt7gTBs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":100671,"logo_path":"/zU6uHxAsB6vlxwwvY8Il6FpbCds.png","name":"Small Town Monsters","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On The Trail of The Lake Michigan Mothman","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
