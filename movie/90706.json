In 1989 vocalist Jon Anderson, drummer Bill Bruford, keyboardist Rick Wakeman, and guitarist Steve Howe released the gold-selling Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe album (complete with Roger Dean cover art) and embarked on a tour called \"An Evening of Yes Music Plus.\" The Evening of Yes Music Plus DVD, directed by Jim Yukich, was filmed at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, CA -- the exact date is not listed in the credits -- and it presents a nearly equal blend of songs from the new album and Yes classics.","popularity":1.09,"poster_path":"/vzlhDDCTLsjr3Tz23vls2HI0HGd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1993-10-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anderson Bruford Wakeman Howe: An Evening of Yes Music Plus","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
