He devises an elaborate ruse to allow his small party to travel with minimal scrutiny through hostile territory, for the money is hidden in a coffin said to contain the body of his dead son. Jonas' other sons travel with him along with a hired \"widow\", as they proceed to what they hope to be a new start to the War between the States. However, while en route, they face severe, ongoing strife among themselves and successive threats from Union soldiers, a posse of cowboys, and an Indian war party.","popularity":4.06,"poster_path":"/vrqo3njFxG6Rvo1eEmz3cRZ0IGX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4529,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alba Cinematografica","origin_country":""},{"id":9232,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tecisa Film","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":7866,"logo_path":null,"name":"Productores Exhibidores Films Sociedad An√≥nima (PEFSA)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1967-02-02","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A coffin without a corpse, crammed with millions in cash!","title":"The Hellbenders","video":false,"vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":40}
