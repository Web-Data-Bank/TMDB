So it raises questions to why the education system isn’t adapting to meet these needs? And, how does it feel to be one of these kids stuck in an institution which isn’t accommodating you?  Teach Me as a documentary sets out to understand these experiences in the present moment from children who are at the age when school makes up a large portion of their daily experiences.  The documentary interviews four children all ages 12 and 13 and each of them with individual and overlapping SEN. Using childlike paper cut-outs and school supplies to form a stylish stop motion that transports you into the world/mind of Dan, Lydia, Martha and Annie.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qoABDS1OyzO0oa4pjEEdjoRRdoL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Teach Me","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
