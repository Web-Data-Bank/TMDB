By the time he came to Rochester, Frank had made seven films and was inproduction on the autobiographical fiction About Me: A Musical while preparing to shoot the controversial Rolling Stones documentary Cocksucker Blues. In need of money to shoot his next film, Frank proposed a non-traditional course to friend Nathan Lyons, suggesting the students work together to make their own movie with Frank acting as more of a collaborator than an instructor. Frank’s approach to working with the group of six students was simple: load up a camera and start shooting the world around you, including yourselves. The resulting 38 minute film is a valuable portrait of a creative collaboration between artists, and a stimulating document of what Frank\r refers to as ‘the chaos of the present.’","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1972-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"About Us","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
