Instead it points to rapid accumulation of plant debris through catastrophic global water deposition. Experiments demonstrate it takes as little as a few days to turn buried plant debris into coal, and produce oil from coal and organic debris. The evidence thus confirms the recent, rapid formation of coal and oil as a result of the Biblical Flood!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lmJpLN3bpMZYJIPrdlzgkiUDrcx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Recent Rapid Formation of Coal and Oil","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
