You learned about DNA in high school biology, but did youknow that DNA includes hidden codes, regulatory information (that for many years was considered by evolutionists to be \"junk\" DNA), and epigenetic information that consists of chemical markers that affect the expression of DNA? The complexity of DNA and the many layers of information encoded by it greatly constrain the ability evolution would have to achieve the random changes necessary for molecules-to-man evolution. Clearly, DNA is not the result of evolutionary processes and disorder but the creative processes and design of the Creator God.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4U8xujzsUhygtbkoAfVS4YwkZqL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"God's Amazing Design","title":"Wonder of DNA","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
