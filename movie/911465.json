The Young Sun is a Christian documentary that examines the known processes of our sun and the most popular theories about its origin as a star. Featuring stunning space photography and informative animations, this creation-proving film explores in great detail the size, distance, structure, energy output, inner workings, and sheer uniqueness of the source of light and heat that God made on day four of creation.  Taking a closer look at the sun, this educational DVD from Bridgestone Multimedia Group features Dr. Jason Lisle, a creationist astrophysicist at Answers in Genesis, Dr. Danny Faulkner, a professor of astronomy at the University of South Carolina, and Dr. Ron Samec, an astronomy and physics professor at Bob Jones University. With their help, The Young Sun shows why it is impossible that any of the proposed evolutionary theories of star formation explain the origin of stars or our sun.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tH33LNtkfSKoAQnix4x34pa9cpc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":54632,"logo_path":"/uX1xTRZz8aJbJiCL22n7HeGR21x.png","name":"Bridgestone Multimedia Group","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Young Sun","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
