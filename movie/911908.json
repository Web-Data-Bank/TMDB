Encouraged by the townspeople and his brother, Bankhe, he re-locates to Bombay, where in a few years time he is able to successfully complete his studies and become a doctor. When he returns home, nothing is the same anymore. His brother Bankhe is absconding, running away from Daku Jwala, who has sworn to kill him to avenge his brother's death - and Dr. Ravi himself has to face Jwala sooner or later - as Jwala's vengeance includes Bankhe and all of his family. Dr. Ravi must now make up his mind to look death at the hands of an angry Jwala - or re-locate and practice medicine elsewhere.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qS40aPC9JZLVgMXooF3Y3MtkI9X.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jwaala Daaku","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
