It intertwines that which I witness with that which I imagine. A perceptual blur arises, where the freakish quietly morphs into the everyday. I am working in the area of unnatural history in an intervened place. Cycles of time are disrupted, and loss is complicated with the spark of possibilities.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fEFlAycDq6RruwtOHKozGT5Rg34.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Season of Wonder","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
