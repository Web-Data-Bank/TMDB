Diana Krall's longstanding relationship with Grammy-winning producer LiPuma (Barbra Streisand, Natalie Cole) shines through on The Look of Love as he wonderfully showcases Krall's mastery as a vocalist and pianist here. From the smoky rendition of \"Cry Me A River,\" to the heartbreaking tenderness of \"I Get Along Without You Very Well,\" to the Spanish language classic \"Besame Mucho,\" not to mention a sultry rendition of the title track, The Look of Love is the album that Diana Krall dreamt about making and one her fans longed for and have since adored.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xY6lgkSV4kAUz6FZr19L3DNn7E3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Diana Krall: The Look of Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
