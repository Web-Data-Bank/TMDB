The crime, which seems to be the work of a madman, encourages the intervention of a whole gallery of freaks. The paths of a strange policeman, a sinister snitch, a religious fanatic, a very peculiar priest and a fan of occult sciences intersect as the killer continues to kill. Between film trivia, football winks and occasional foul humor, the plot advances towards a terrifying outcome.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lKLoih6NXcfm2mEIlt14M0mgRsm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":165291,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mondiola Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UY","name":"Uruguay"}],"release_date":"2005-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Banfield Killer","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
