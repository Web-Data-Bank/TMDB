How much playing and how much seriousness does it take to acquire one of the most basic skills in life? This film presents the process of learning to read and write in the first grade of elementary school. A teacher who explains and shows each letter with never-ending patience and love, and 13 students who draw fishes in order to write correctly, disagree, laugh, have difficulties, try their best with every syllable, and concentrate on their target. Little adventures in the classroom with pencils, erasers and straight (or not) lines.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5cvFLKY3lNhQZbnaTZ97y2QCHTW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2021-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Our ABCs","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
