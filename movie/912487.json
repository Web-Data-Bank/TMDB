Jimmy buys a balloon or two and looks over the station for a little girl. He takes one by mistake, narrowly escapes being arrested as a kidnapper and finally meets the niece, who is an over-dressed, ultra-modern young woman. The time between trains is spent in trying to hide the dog from the policeman, and when Jimmy puts his charge on the train, he feels that he has done a week's work in a day.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2t78FDATkYHkBox93ek1B4ZJHC5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2159,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hal Roach Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1924-08-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sweet Daddy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
