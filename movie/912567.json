There are scenes of conversations that seem to change location with each cut, or railroad crossings where up trains and down trains melt into one another, an exchange with a Polaroid brother from Tokyo at Osaka Castle, or a tennis scene. The artist's unique method and the expansion of images backed by it create a rich game of images and words.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kyTweWrPvLoRk5R6ZwGCTAQhWVv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rabbits Are Sleeping","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
