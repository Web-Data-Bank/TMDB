Situated deep in Central Victoria on the banks of the Goulburn River at TFS HQ, we follow the band as they prepare for a rock show in their barn. Referencing the feel of the Australian Western and Australian Gothic (see Wake in Fright, The Cars That Ate Paris and Picnic at Hanging Rock) we travel with the band through their abject, weird and beautiful space. The weekend starts as the band welcomes you into their studio/cocktail lounge and teach you how to make their signature drink, The Tropical Fuck Fizz, then entertain you, Rat Pack style.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nuoc9oVV77IXUidLuXcf2BBhRIU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2021-12-08","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Goody Goody Gumdrops","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
