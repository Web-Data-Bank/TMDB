Trying to make it through the night with her baby, she sets out along the roads of Algeria only to find herself caught up, through a series of unfortunate encounters, in a spiral of violence. Soula is an extraordinary portrait of a woman under pressure, both from those closest to her and a society riddled with contradictions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bWPwtNOaR5nnKQDX5svMAtam0vh.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Amharic","iso_639_1":"am","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Soula","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
