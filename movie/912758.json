Fifty years later, directors Karim Debbagh and Jay Bulgur retrace his steps, capturing many of the same pieces of music – which are handed down from one generation to the next – on film. A mysterious soundscape of musical rituals, dealing with fertility, birth, circumcision, grief, coming of age, marriage, divorce, life, death and art, it is both a historical record and, thanks to the elevating nature of the music, food for the soul.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Their Heads are Green and Their Hands are Blue","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
