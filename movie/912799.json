It's not a song. Nor a documentary. IYH is an ambitious dream that brings all that together and shows how raw and how intense the symbiosis between a group of friends and their favorite band can be. It's a concept that was born the moment Dave Grohl (lead vocalist of Foo Fighters) surprised by the wild crowd's reaction during their show in Argentina in March 2018, salid \"Why don't you start a band and I'll come to see you every night, how about that?\" That phrase, which most of the times is symbolically interpreted as a thank-you gesture, didn't go unnoticed by one of the members of the crowd that night, Juan Pablo Sanzi, who immediately got the message of his idol and realized he had to do something about it. And so he did. IYH is a unique insight on a particular trait of Argentinian idiosyncrasy, linked the notion of 'passion' portrayed by soccer fans and how their behavior is replicated in rock concerts.","popularity":0.891,"poster_path":"/iZHghwoLOyg1yB2PEZZGsRuSsLw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AR","name":"Argentina"}],"release_date":"2021-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In Your Honor","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
