The charter day, during March 2018, shows the engine and its goods train at various locations along the line.  We have produced the film in the order that the clips were taken, and it shows well how a charter day works, with the train making multiple passes of each photo point the train stopped at.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pCdqTCywwg9EhkUxWzzsiMXDDIe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":165497,"logo_path":null,"name":"RailAdvent","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Day With 70013 Oliver Cromwell","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
