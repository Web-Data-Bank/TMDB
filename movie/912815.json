The first railway to feature is the East Lancashire Railway, where we visited for the Spring Steam Gala, Spring Diesel Gala, Autumn Steam Gala and their DMU Gala.  Second up is the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway, where we visited for their Spring Steam Gala and their Flying Scotsman visit.  Third up is the Llangollen Railway, where we visited for a day trip during our Summer holiday and their Autumn Steam Gala.  The National Railway Museum was also on our visit list for 2017.  Out on the mainline, we were lucky enough to catch 45690 Leander on the North Wales Coast Express at Llandudno Junction, Conwy Castle and Holyhead.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zlADtHciAmCfMty2wqY4ZwSQc2m.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":165497,"logo_path":null,"name":"RailAdvent","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2018-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Adventures of 2017 – Standard Gauge, Mainline & Railway Museum","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
