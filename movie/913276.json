That's when we meet her: at the age of 27 Nika is full of hopes and doubts regarding her gift. Due to the age restriction, she's got just one shot to enter the Drama School, and that's her only chance to separate from her cherishing and oppressive mother. Acquaintance with a new friend Ivan gives Nika hope for a happy future, but there is still something in her memory that triggers her. Tragically cheerful, painfully confused and desperately believing in love and life after childhood, Nika puts everything on the line to overcome ghosts of the past.","popularity":1.041,"poster_path":"/AsRDGCYuQDJPa3lv4FrymSfTeYe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":134116,"logo_path":"/s3JTlXPJgR9fdJ7u0GoPePGr8jz.png","name":"National Media Group","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":100821,"logo_path":"/qBnzozNLi8gHHqwyN0ycGy8seZm.png","name":"Vodorod Film Company","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":3451,"logo_path":"/53lT8VOQ9JDiPGYLvjgO42Av58I.png","name":"Art Pictures Studio","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2022-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nika","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":5}
