Rescued by local fishermen as a baby and raised by giant otter expert Carolina Vargas, this is the story of a young giant otter's journey to adulthood. At first, Sancho is utterly dependent on Carolina, and has to be bottle fed and taught how to catch fish. Eventually Carolina knows that she will have to break their extraordinary bond as Sancho makes his way back into the wild. Giant otters are highly social animals, so Carolina doesn't know whether an orphaned giant otter can survive alone in the world's biggest wetland. In the idyllic Pantanal, we follow Sancho's story as he learns to survive in a world fraught with danger.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ewtrKYig8bTy6X1QnbkNYDo4kk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-11","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Raising Sancho","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
