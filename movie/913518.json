Armed with cameras, International Animal Rescue has documented their struggle: pulling apes from devastated jungle, giving emergency medical care, rehabilitating and releasing the healthiest orangutans back into the wild. This is both the story of their life-saving work and of how one of our closest wild relatives has been pushed to the brink of extinction. Combining genuine rescue footage with contributions from experts throughout, this documentary looks toward the future and asks what hope remains to save the orangutan.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jKL0neliyr5ycIQ4cBikueqfvtI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-05-10","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Red Ape: Saving the Orangutan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
