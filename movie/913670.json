Tranquil scenes of unassuming neighborhoods near Burlington International Airport are juxtaposed with voicemails of the unheard, those drowned out by the ear-shattering “sound of freedom.” Exploring the relationship between picturesque residential areas and the deafening fighter jets overhead, Jet Line is a poetic portrait of a community plagued by war machines, documenting untenable conditions in a small city once voted one of the best places to live in America.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2IJqqUSyxpO2iXpeQE7VgZvDmre.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Voicemails from the Flight Path","title":"Jet Line","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
