Cora, a Danish woman, finds an unfinished documentary in  which Benjamim, her Brazilian father, attempted - fifty years earlier - to  investigate the story of his own parents: Teo, who, afflicted by insanity, died  when he was still a child, and Elenir, a mysterious woman he’d barely heard  of. In the course of his investigation, Benjamim discovers that both characters  are part of a complex family puzzle, filled with traumas and taboos, and starts  seeing himself as an important piece in the puzzle.
