After finding a discarded mannequin head, Brian gets an idea. Three days, a washing machine, and sundry spare parts later, he’s invented Charles, an artificially intelligent robot who learns English from a dictionary and proves a charming, cheeky companion. Before long, however, Charles also develops autonomy. Intrigued by the wider world — or whatever lies beyond the cottage where Brian has hidden him away — Charles craves adventure.","popularity":9.807,"poster_path":"/pzP3N9qRo3S91QjfBFWNI0ph0AY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":61922,"logo_path":"/aGPysvtFfH8d8UjekpZD3GT9m7k.png","name":"Bankside Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":7281,"logo_path":"/lkqIuaKTm2sg3umwTBScmqyzLX5.png","name":"BFI","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":6705,"logo_path":"/e8EXNSfwr5E9d3TR8dHKbQnQK4W.png","name":"Film4 Productions","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":52352,"logo_path":"/dHjAAPaqpjsikkKzmhZ4ofQaEkQ.png","name":"Great Point Media","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":10146,"logo_path":"/xnFIOeq5cKw09kCWqV7foWDe4AA.png","name":"Focus Features","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-06-17","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Some friendships are built to last.","title":"Brian and Charles","video":false,"vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":68}
