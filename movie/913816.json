A lower-middle-class Black family, they feel the strain of their new reality as the political dust settles. Tércia, the mother, reinterprets her world after an unexpected encounter leaves her wondering if she’s cursed. Her husband, Wellington, puts all of his hopes into the soccer career of their son, Deivinho, who reluctantly follows his father’s ambitions despite secretly aspiring to study astrophysics and colonize Mars. Meanwhile, their older daughter, Eunice, falls in love with a free-spirited young woman and ponders whether it’s time to leave home.","popularity":3.247,"poster_path":"/6PTeldtg309CXTLf18Iluw2WtWq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":37098,"logo_path":"/wPQrM2TrAnYi93HkRlmu7vYvZhX.png","name":"Filmes de Plástico","origin_country":"BR"},{"id":13573,"logo_path":"/4dqepK1XdLklrsYdnFpCEkOPXLX.png","name":"Canal Brasil","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2022-08-25","revenue":0,"runtime":115,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mars One","video":false,"vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":48}
