Amid a backdrop of political unrest and the heartbreaking unraveling of Beirut, five bandmates form a beacon of expression, resistance, and independence. Director Rita Baghdadi follows founders and guitarists Lilas Mayassi and Shery Bechara as their tenderness, and sometimes bitterness, for one another grows in ways both unexpected and deeply moving. Joined by vocalist Maya Khairallah, bassist Alma Doumani, and drummer Tatyana Boughaba, these women negotiate their emotional journeys through young adulthood in tumultuous circumstances with grace, raw passion, and a ferocious commitment to their art. Their grit is tested as they grapple with the complexities of friendship, sexuality, and the destruction around them.","popularity":3.459,"poster_path":"/tp8rmMBt2WRVIG5FILfsGhrJM9P.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":150969,"logo_path":"/7oS9vcqTqm4m7x1GP0zBZaRkiPw.png","name":"Animal Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":168286,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lady \u0026 Bird","origin_country":""},{"id":107344,"logo_path":null,"name":"Endless Eye Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":128976,"logo_path":"/6ZfJiskmTdzvYs8861ynrFNMSzk.png","name":"XTR","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LB","name":"Lebanon"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-01-23","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sirens","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1}
