Crafted entirely from immersive archival footage and free from the distraction of retrospective voices, this hypnotic and audaciously revealing documentary takes a distinctive formal approach, allowing the story of the Peopleâ€™s Princess to unfold before us like never before.","popularity":14.002,"poster_path":"/kNU8gzCuoYuZr1hl36xAlCAxFwF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15285,"logo_path":"/rt5C9eCSrz7K1ReFRfTfddpe9K3.png","name":"Lightbox Entertainment","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Her life.
