In 1928 she went to Paris to study opera without knowing a word of French and having never heard of Richard Wagner.  In 1941, at the height her success, she was tragically cut down by polio and became completely paralysed. With the help of Australian nurse, Sister Kenny, Marjorie regained movement in her upper body and resumed her career in a wheelchair. In 1955, MGM made a movie of her life, \"Interrupted Melody\", starring Eleanor Parker and Glenn Ford, which won an Academy Award.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pejISmtgBysoKblxhVA55Hm8DXI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":107913,"logo_path":null,"name":"Australian International Pictures","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"From Victorian farm girl to one of the worldâ€™s greatest opera sopranos","title":"Marjorie Lawrence: The World at Her Feet","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
