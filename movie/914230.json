The action centers on legal eagle Steve Vegas, a successful litigator who has neglected his wife for too long. She leaves him, kissing him off with a Dear John letter that she's stuck to the fridge. Steve sinks into depression but still manages to drag himself to work. Once there, he tells his problems to fellow lawyer Carol Cummings, who soothes his feelings with some sensual sex. But although Carol feels for Steve, she's really in love with the firm's third partner Eric Price.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6xUjyOZeNA3KoIWgOGMGjUQuc6j.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":141473,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dreamland Elite","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"All the Right Motions","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
