At the same time, it is one of the very few countries that have a positive image of future. There is no festival like GOGOLFEST in the whole world. It takes place every year since 2007 in Ukraine. The festival is established by Vlad Troitskyi, a Ukrainian director, screenwriter, actor and the founder of Dakh Theatre. GOGOLFEST breaks the old way of thinking and shatters the ferrous curtain of ghosts of the past. His task is to resume the tradition of the avant-garde.","popularity":0.851,"poster_path":"/wWUSnP5WuYx47ytObF7B6rYCtgs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2019-04-11","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gogol Doc","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
