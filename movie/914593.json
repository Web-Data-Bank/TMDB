Unearthly calls of the notorious Tasmanian devil echo through the land, but following them over the course of a year reveals a surprisingly gentle side. In the dry east, rare white wallabies graze on the plains and jack jumper ants build huge nests – these venomous ants are amongst the most dangerous on earth. In the west, where it can rain nearly every day of the year, caves light up with the magical spectacle of thousands of glow-worms, and the trees are 100-metre towering monsters. Rivers are home to the peculiar platypus, and world’s largest freshwater invertebrate, the Tasmanian giant lobster. Miniature penguins come ashore to breed, and as winter approaches, the southern lights dance in the sky. Tasmania’s isolation and unique climate has created a world that is as weird as it is wonderful.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3dL3HxgJZp6gnZctKS2l5nCmoGZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tasmania: Weird and Wonderful","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
