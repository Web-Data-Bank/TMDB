As nature filtered through digital communications channels becomes the new norm, the boundaries start to blur between mediated and physical experience. Hentschläger’s work probes the question whether “nature” and the concept of the “original” can still culturally exist in the Anthropocene, in this age of human influence. What exactly is real, in the sense of the pure and original, and what is to be understood as constructed and artificial? Measure has been commissioned by Audemars Piguet.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/duB5Ea9AI2KYXJpAHIPN6lHgULR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2014-09-25","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Measure","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
