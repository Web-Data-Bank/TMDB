The anonymous narrator of the film discusses her history of experiencing blackouts through drinking; covering a five-year time period that culminated in an entire three-day time-loss, her last bender. She also discusses levels of sobriety and her desire to continue to explore various recreational drugs. The narrator declares her intention to live her life alcohol-free, while simultaneously not wanting her identity to be defined through her problematic relationship with alcohol. The narrative is open, stark and direct: a dark insight, flecked with humor. Visually, the work stutters through black moments, punctuated by originally recorded, hand-processed 16mm color film, deploying multiple exposure and other in-camera, experimental techniques.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-08-23","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blackout","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
