Like the flower whose habitat is the hard ground, she is surrounded by hard trials and ironies of fate: separation from the one who loved and is still loved by her, abandonment by her husband, the trials of being a single parent, the violence of the gaze of men who sees her as fair game. Not unlike the flower Leipaklei, which hibernates beneath parched grounds - dreaming for a spring past, the protagonist dreams of the return of her beloved. He returns.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xbSZWCZvx4J1JxuhLDp6NSp3evb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Leipaklei","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
