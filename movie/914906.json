This film is a lyrical portrait of the valley through the eyes of four characters who make their living from the land: a cider maker, a salmon fisherman, a sheep farmer and a beekeeper. It might seem idyllic, but when you live this close to nature a change in the weather can make all the difference between success and failure.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5IN5ZW63DdJ9gLDCibygidO5Eon.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-06-13","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wye: Voices From the Valley","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
