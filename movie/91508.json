However, each of these young people has, to a greater or lesser degree, a problem. The parties and parties enjoyed by a group of young people from the upper class are the basis of the story that explains this film. Among them we find the famous couple, once happy, formed by Carlos Larrañaga and María Luisa Merlo. Directed by Fernando Palacios, and with a script by Rafael J. Salvia and Pedro Masó, \" It's always Sunday \" has no greater intention than entertainment, despite giving history a certain sociological touch, for that of valuing the behavior of the Youth of the time.","popularity":1.45,"poster_path":"/gUEYlvl9QLQnHvuEP6f1lGmIW2R.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88685,"logo_path":null,"name":"Asturias Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1961-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Siempre es domingo","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
