She decides to marry her shy school sweetheart Mishka, who now works in the mine. The miners finally receive some pay, but Mishka still ends up with no money to buy his bride a gift, so he seeks the help of his perpetually drunk buddy Garkusha. Mishka's poor working-class family all help to put on a fine wedding with copious amounts of vodka, even though they are suspicious of Tanya's occupation in Moscow, and of her connection with her Mafia ex-boyfriend Borodin.","popularity":1.955,"poster_path":"/rDmmLTs7wnpqUVRybLkzB3J5nwf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94,"logo_path":"/huC7HqorvUThGIrENrbcHmQVUA0.png","name":"ARTE France Cinéma","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":104,"logo_path":"/9aotxauvc9685tq9pTcRJszuT06.png","name":"Canal+","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":17084,"logo_path":"/gvpnQhxFbQ6afXjzRKt654HPy7y.png","name":"Catherine Dussart Productions (CDP)","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":310,"logo_path":"/4Gp5A4YdjPBfsHT47ngHMaXWmb9.png","name":"CNC","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":9341,"logo_path":null,"name":"Etalon-Film","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":91058,"logo_path":"/89sqJVs4JlVzU11XrTq4q9SouG9.png","name":"Filmbüro Süd","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":16975,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lichtblick Film- und Fernsehproduktion (I)","origin_country":""},{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":170585,"logo_path":"/1nUzkMSbZOzoYgHHhBSJ5xGwnIm.png","name":"Mosfilm","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2000-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":114,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Wedding","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":16}
