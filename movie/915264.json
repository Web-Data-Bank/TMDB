Having sold just under 2 million albums worldwide, they are among rock music's greatest pioneers. Single-handedly spawning the grunge movement of the 1990s, their unique mix of punk, pop and surf rock inspired an entire generation of musicians, and embodied 90's alternative Rock. After splitting acrimoniously in 1992, they reformed in 2004 to wide acclaim. They're captured here from BBC's Maida Vale studios in London.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/t2Bnet0CP1Bg77ToP1XGuxLRn2p.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":161216,"logo_path":"/3fhO3ylGjLhz29mAAIYzGgDq3Rb.png","name":"BBC Radio 6","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2013-09-23","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pixies: 6Music In Concert","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
