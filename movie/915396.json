Pulchny uses collages, engravings, drawings and he contrasts green and red colour. The style and theme of the film refers to Jan Lenica’s \"Maze\". According to Erich Fromm’s \"Escape from Freedom\", the protagonist asks to cut off his wings because he notices the emotions he evokes in society. The film is a metaphor of the political situation in the Polish People’s Republic in 1960.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1pDSVMxANyTRcgQJHy6ph0sODt5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19066,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Miniatur Filmowych","origin_country":"PL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"1965-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wings","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
