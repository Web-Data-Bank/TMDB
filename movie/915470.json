They live on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi with the rest of their gang of crested black macaques. These very special primates are found nowhere else in the world. Twenty-five years ago, wildlife cameraman Colin Stafford-Johnson visited Sulawesi for the first time and now he has returned. Fascinated by the monkeys, Colin hopes to reveal their sometimes violent, often playful and, just like our own, highly political world. What he discovers leads him on a much bigger journey than he was ever expecting.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Meet the Monkeys","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
