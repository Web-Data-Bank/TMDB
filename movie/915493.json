The moment is interrupted by the man and his thoughts â€“ he has to go in order to earn money. They spend autumn and winter separately - she yearns alone, he works hard in a mine and a forge. In spring, when the woman runs towards the man in order to welcome him, she sees a dead man walking. She manages to recognize him only by the pendant that she gave him. In her embrace, the man regains his strength.
