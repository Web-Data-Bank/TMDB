As he ruminates on his place in any world and loses his grip, he also loses his wife and his children's respect, and critics tear him apart. The final undoing of this screenwriter is a deadline that must be met at all costs, costs that perhaps are too great.","popularity":3.103,"poster_path":"/i5RrZraeTUgpIqazLfbm2UxehTu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18356,"logo_path":null,"name":"Horror Picture Films","origin_country":""},{"id":4952,"logo_path":null,"name":"Canadian Film Development Corporation (CFDC)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"His obsession was to create the ultimate horror storyâ€¦ his curse was to live it.","title":"Deadline","video":false,"vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":21}
