On the other hand if you think of terms like dirty, sleazy and raunchy as positives then this may be what you're looking for. We can thank two women for that, Buffy (Davis) and Lorrie Lovett. Buffy gives her usual performance-- to-the-limit then over-the-top. She always carried on like there's no next time and always with constant exhortations to her co-stars. She might prove to be too much for some viewers, but she always gave it the proverbial 110%. Lorrie was once dubbed by a writer \"the queen of peroxide sleaze\"--and he meant it as a compliment. She didn't vocalize like Buffy, but her effect on the viewer was much the same. There's an air of out-of-control danger about both of them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":118998,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vidco Video","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-08-19","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dark Side of the Moon","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
