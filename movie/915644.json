One take, a little over 7 minutes in length is a black wooden chair slowly being rained upon by large multi-colored feathers. There is no sound. The piece is Zen like and meditative transporting the viewer into contentment as feathers gather on and around the chair.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uTtRqpU5XeJWzUDtYpN923co6c8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1975-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Chair","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
