Her husband is his good friend. They draw closer to one another as the nights go on and look out over the city to the dark satellites, the brutalist concrete buildings on the outskirts of the city - relics of the GDR past. A security guard watches over Objekt 95, a satellite town with a residential complex which many foreigners call home. While on patrol at night, he gets to know a young Ukrainian woman who fled her home country when the war broke out. He wants to protect her, while his friend, the “old security guard”, radios to him from an abandoned Russian barrack night after night. A woman from the train cleaning service drinks in a train station bar after her night shift. There, she meets a hairdresser. The two of them become friends and spend many nights together in the station. Every night, her desire grows even greater for this woman who is exactly as lonely as she is.","popularity":1.07,"poster_path":"/t1GDSptrqsu6wm0bgkeEYzOVlss.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2685,"logo_path":"/ewmxzGZreCRo3qbz6xoAlulnnKL.png","name":"Sommerhaus Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":2068,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mitteldeutsche Medienförderung","origin_country":""},{"id":172666,"logo_path":null,"name":"MFG Medien- und Filmgesellschaft Baden-Württemberg mbH","origin_country":""},{"id":172667,"logo_path":"/7HeVaLcAm0sZ8BzjsLckbujssmt.png","name":"MOIN Filmförderung Hamburg Schleswig-Holstein","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":332,"logo_path":"/a7tPwK3iyyxhRA1Sjavc2xZnIW.png","name":"Die Beauftragte der Bundesregierung für Kultur und Medien","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":45198,"logo_path":"/9z46Z8Px88a30wkr7G0QUDbbtt2.png","name":"Deutscher Filmförderfonds","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":96105,"logo_path":"/yTIbkYK1VGE64FSFqPj5jGDvLG.png","name":"Warner Bros.
