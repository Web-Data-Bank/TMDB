The film shows footage of the march, the brutal police response and resulting chaos interspersed with scenes from the rather callous and superficial inquest. Filmmakers attached to the project have confirmed that the original elements for the film disappeared over 40 years ago.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/acO1vQhMMWI27Cq9X0H5dAsYtWB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1970-08-29","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Requiem-29","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
