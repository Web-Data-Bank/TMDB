In the film, two actors come into conflict on set while their film work becomes indistinguishable from the reality of their relationship. The film jumps between their conflicts on set and an abstracted space where the actors physically express their increasingly complicated emotions towards each other, and towards their toxic director.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3eQTjbQ99xMPUik9MIjPo2S8tnM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Speaking of Flowers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
