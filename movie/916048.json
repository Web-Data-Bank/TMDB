In 1967, the publication began to confer annual awards; in 1978, it began televising them, with the inclusion of artist performances. These awards were not decided by a secretive, politically motivated committee or by an \"association,\" but by fan nominations. Each installment of the Country Legends Live series highlights performances from particular annual awards shows. Country Legends Live, Vol. 1 offers a \"best of\" the 1978 and 1979 Music City News Awards Shows. Featured artists in this installment include Mel Tillis, Tom T.
