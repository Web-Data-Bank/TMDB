Gerhard Göbelt and Klaus Friedrich are operating their mobile cinemas with full passion. Whether it is in a city hall, on a meadow in open air or even on a ferry – for lots of people in the countryside they are the guarantee for a couple of carefree hours with good entertainment. However this will change sooner than later because both Göbelt and Friedrich are looking forward to their retirement. Since there are no successors willing to take over their work, it is most likely that a lot of small communities in Baden-Württemberg will lose their last cultural asset. Wolfram Hannemann’s documentary portrays those two “culture heroes” and tries to put their tireless work into perspective which covers several decades of film history. The film was made during the Covid pandemic which also affected mobile cinemas.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3GGt1AICKpSV8YhvJKWdlB5lVxF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2021-08-05","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kultourhelden – Vom Ende einer Ära","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
