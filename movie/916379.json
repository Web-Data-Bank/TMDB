The full spectrum of love's possibilities is encompassed from the darkest side of lust and carnality right through to its most sublime and divine expression. The sonnets are intermixed with brief scenes from Shakespeare's plays thematically intertwined. There is an eclectic mix of music and song from classical Indian genre to Mozart's sonatas, modern film music, the mystical strains of Gurdjieff's piano music, Sanskrit Vedic hymns and more. Classical Indian dancer Arunima Kumar adds a further dimension in magnifying and illuminating the full range of emotions which the sonnets and play extracts embody. O learn to read what silent love hath writ To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4hTH7JhMfswhy1Bf5WpEp94e6o3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-06-14","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Love in Eternity","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
