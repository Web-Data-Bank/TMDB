At that time I was watching Godard films, walking, taking the Metro, looking at the Genie de la Bastille, filming a torso and eating baguette. I brought the different elements together and introduced a spinning 10 franc coin, a fall guy and a crime jazz music score. It is a return to black and white 16mm single screen film for me and also a return to the image of the male torso, that I first used in my film Claiming Territory in 1993.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"From Stalingrad to Jaurès","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
