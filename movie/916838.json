Unfortunately, her husband is a drunk. When he tries to give some liquor to their infant son, she brandishes a pair of scissors at him. He wrestles them away from her, then falls down the stairs and stabs himself. Due to the perjured testimony of the maid and butler, Paula is convicted of murder and sent to jail. Her son, Danny, grows up to be a movie star. There is a controversy surrounding him because he refuses to do his own stunts. The reason he won't take any chances is that he is using all his money to get his mother out of jail. Finally, to redeem himself, he agrees to participate in a charity auto race, but his mother's hearing is scheduled for the race day.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xebDzvFsGJeWzXDKv5DLLReTdEY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1925-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Speeding Right at your Heart!","title":"The Pace That Thrills","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
