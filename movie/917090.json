The old lady, who lives alone in the mansion, begins to lose the ability to recognize herself in her wedding photos. As the memory fades away, it seems to make the objects in the house gradually lose their meanings. Facing those objects that have been lost in history, I try to add my own memories as if to give them new souls, and the video itself is the container that contains everything and becomes their new body.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bHIyAltHZNh5K08nd4w3HT57cYX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2019-09-19","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Mansion with Sunlight Passing Through","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
