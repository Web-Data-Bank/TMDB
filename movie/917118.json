Primarily, the work is an experiment with updating the Kuleshov effect for social media, that is, showing how the juxtaposition of images will be read by a cinema audience as narrative, even though the projection of emotional connections between the images is, as here, entirely the construct of the audience.

This simulation of a fourth ‘Before’ film for the pandemic sees Jesse (Ethan Hawke) and Céline (Julie Delpy) on a video call during lockdown in 2020, separated, and unwittingly recreating the scene in the record booth from Before Sunrise. The video incorporates footage from the Q&As that Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy did with Cameron Bailey for TIFF Originals on 30 April and 12 May 2020 respectively.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/x1ttqFIMCkE0pqdb5UwcehBxSfu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Before the End","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
