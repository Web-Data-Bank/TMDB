Alfred Dreyfus, an officer on the general staff, was charged with selling secrets to a foreign power. He was tried and judged guilty on flimsy evidence, and sentenced to imprisonment on Devil's Island, where he remained for eight years, until his influential friends, who took up his case in earnest, proved it was a plot formed by other officers, who subsequently confessed to having forged the documents.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yJFGntLgszxXDKXkZ4VOrgLdAP3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21594,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Frères","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"1908-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dreyfus Affair","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
