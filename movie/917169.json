This studio will not be noticed by any of the people, but there are very interesting things happening here. There is an art workshop for visually handicapped children. They meet a pedagogue and try to get to know the world through their artistic activities other than with their eyes - they special toys to know what time is, to draw tactile colors what they know from other senses, and to use abstract natural materials that we usually don't think about and how difficult it is to pass it on to a blind person. It is this activity, taking place in the middle of many anonymous houses, that I would like to record and bring closer to a world that we do not really know much about, along with the obstacles these people have to quietly overcome.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Touch of Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
