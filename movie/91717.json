But that’s not enough, according to director Tim Pierce: since the start of the year he has been shooting a DVD documentary about Jossi, Byron, Beau and Jackson Wells and their parents Bruce and Stacey. “The story of the Wells family is one of the most exciting tales there has ever been in action sport,” says Pierce, “Which is why I want to introduce this unique family, which has spawned four of the most talented freeskiers in the world.” In 52 action-packed minutes, viewers are not only given a surprising insight into the dynamics of an exceptional family. They get to experience skiing at a whole new level. “This docu-DVD aims to give the fans more than ever before. It’s like ‘Winter of Wells’ on steroids.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"...like 'Winter of Wells' on steroids.","title":"Winter Of Wells The Documentary","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
