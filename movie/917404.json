Frank shot footage of the Bickershaw festival in 1972. This footage serves as the visual foundations for the film, An event in the village. We see Frankâ€™s original footage as we hear him describing the recording of the event 35 years after it happened. The Bickershaw festival was the last 3 day festival in the north west of England. The Kinks, Captain Beefheart and the Grateful Dead all played during the weekend. This work investigates memory and documentary - the gaps between event, actuality, recording and memory. Frank speaks with great fondness about his village and its takeover by Hippies over a long weekend in May 1972.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"An event in the village","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
