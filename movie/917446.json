Aristotle said, in the Poetics, “Metaphor consists in giving the thing a name that belongs to something else; the transference being either from genus to species, or from species to genus, or from species to species, on the grounds of analogy” Metaphor here can only give way to the real. Felt experience, phenomenological reality seem to be all that is left when grappling a flame. And what is written, in letter and image, seem to go beyond what can ever be spoken and heard.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-05-14","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dead Metaphor","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
