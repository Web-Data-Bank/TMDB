In the spring of 1983, noted undersea explorer Dr. Joseph MacInnis led a team of twenty men on one of the most difficult, dangerous and unforgettable undersea adventures of the century--to put a diver on board the sunken vessel and recover some artifacts. This film, introduced by H.R.H. Prince Charles, provides a stunning visual account of this historic expedition.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eQ6AZyZAmb4b3vWuFUnISt5QEFn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Land That Devours Ships","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
