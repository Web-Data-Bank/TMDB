In despair she went to a wise married woman who told her she had the wrong system, that she should talk about the men. \"The Fable of the Sarcastic Husband and the Lady Shopper\" is about a \"lady\" who spent the entire day shopping at top speed, then brought home a small spool of thread.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7hqlj1bKu397T7tHwpYTkbuRjB4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5109,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Essanay Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Two Pop-Up Fables","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
