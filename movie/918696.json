Celia, however, prefers Ben and tries to discourage Arthur. Arthur is a little bit peeved when the girl he loves passes him up for Ben, and the soldier of love determines that revenge will be sweet. That afternoon Arthur borrows his sister's dress and makes Ben take him for a ride in his roadster. Of course Celia sees Ben with the supposed lady and proceeds to get jealous. You can imagine the surprise and humiliation Celia suffers when at \"Patricola's Tango Tea\" she finds a photograph of Ben with the lady of the afternoon.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gFvEBlMuSJgmCrNmClXMJo3cWYL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5109,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Essanay Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-10-29","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cupid and Three","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
