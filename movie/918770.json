When she publicly demanded to be excommunicated from the Mormon church on a national TV talk show, she got what she asked for—leaving her completely ostracized from her Mormon community. This highly engaging doc follows Post as she journeys to Salt Lake City where she has been invited to speak at the Affirmation Conference—an annual gathering of gay and lesbian Mormons and ex-Mormons who are trying to reconcile their faith with their homosexuality. As cynical as she has become about her former religion, Post finds herself struggling with conflicting emotions that she had buried for years, while realizing that she has finally found her own lost tribe.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jgrKKWTuhNU2ajfUpkhxjSAiqFs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Lost Tribe","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
