Both leave construction sites behind: The national team does not play climate-neutrally and the Federal Republic lacks the right game tactics.  Quite different is the trio of Branson, Musk and Bezos, who are already building a corona-free future in space without a rental cover. One thing is certain: they all come down. This is especially true for Armin Laschet. The candidate for chancellor has freed his CDU from the burden of the government. The question arises more and more often: Who is playing for whom? And why 5G when you can also have 2G.  Dieter Nuhr looks back on 2021, a year full of misunderstandings. And he does what he always does. His analysis is remarkably unobjective, but always subjective and hilarious.  From the Berlin Friedrichstadtpalast.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8XXT2dtNoocjmZZt0hUKoI2vRvB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-12-18","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nuhr 2021 - Der Jahresrückblick","video":false,"vote_average":8.3,"vote_count":3}
