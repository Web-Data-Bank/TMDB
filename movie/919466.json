We see them change into their \"wild style\" clothes on the street, cruise around \"gay city,\" and \"throw attitude\" with friends at the gay park. Along the way they answer questions about the nature of being gay, relationships with friends and lovers, style and image, and their use of gay language. As the piece progresses, the positions of fact and fiction overlap, highlighting the contradictions in their stories and in the artist's own method of constucting this \"wildlife documentary.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wild Life","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
