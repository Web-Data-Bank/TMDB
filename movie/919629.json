He is brought to him by his several-year-old son. In the office, apart from the dentist, a plush toy awaits him - \"Checkered dog\", which the man remembers from his childhood. The doctor, by playing films with the participation of a dog on a VCR, means that the man, absorbed in watching his favorite childhood hero, does not pay attention to the run-offs and thus can extract the aching tooth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1986-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tato, nie bój się dentysty","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
