Linked to Taller de Gráfica Popular do México and the Communist Party, they turned printmaking into a way of popularizing art, with realistic themes and social denunciation. The documentary reveals the appropriation of these artists of the brazilian arts, from the pampas in Rio Grande do Sul to the palaces of Brasília.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yGqi6wJBZXzOERWAT1HD8hzYawz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2018-08-07","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grupo de Bagé","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
