These moments, frozen, in time, digitally manipulated and animated, resulting in a «photo film» create a broad film of associations for innumerable scenarios involving war and other catastrophes. It suggests looking through a frosty window at faded relics of destruction which is both frightening and absurd, one's perpective completely unrelated to time.
