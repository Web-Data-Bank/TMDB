Then, in rapid and irregular alternations, constant vibrations, they fill the entire field. This time the lines tend to move rather than the colors. The rhythms of night and day alternate in the space outside the picture, at the same time enabling it to take on a structure. The broken, torn-up melody drives the visual aspect, the contrast provokes a nearly cheerful sight. The space occupied by the images is an open one.
