Borrowing from Milton’s Paradise Lost, Karlin tells the tale of commuter Michael Deakin (Nicholas Farrell), self appointed archangel, who falls asleep on his train and dreams of ridding Britain of the Dark Prince (Rupert Murdoch). The Voice of Reason stops him and not only exposes the futility of Deakin’s quest but confronts us, the silent majority, with our complicity in Murdoch’s rise to power.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Serpent","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
