Employing an original syntax of storytelling, the artist interweaves scattered and reassembled landscapes with layers of captured audio, poetic text, and music. A rhythmic account of the spiritual implications of colonial plunder, Hopinka’s fluid reflections transmute ideas of spiritual malleability tied to land, sky, sea, myth, place, and personhood.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xrwIhZVYMQhtxD75L0InKbfX47H.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mnemonics of Shape and Reason","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
