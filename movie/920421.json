Relations between groups of children and adolescents and their adult guides; teaching methods and educational practices; materials and symbolic rules; relationships between the form of places and behaviors; the reverberation of what is learned in everyone's daily lives. An old super-eight projector, faded images on the wall, a puppet theater. The relationship between pupil and teacher, the transmission of knowledge, the experiences of a past that is only apparently distant in Naples, a city where school has never been the primary source of learning, nor has played a significant role in learning how to live.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hF1IaLWifTa5cAqKeglwgcrC9A9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"YEAST","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
