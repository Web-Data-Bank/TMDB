Presented in 1.33:1 full-frame, the image quality on both Black and Joy is as good as can be expected, with slight, occasional pixilation more likely due to the source materials that the actual video transfer. Dolby Digital Stereo audio is strong throughout. In addition to Black and Joy, fans of Joy Division will be happy to note the inclusion of the IC Water promo featuring footage of the late Ian Curtis inter-cut with Orridge walking the beach as flowers bloom in time-lapse and dolphins leap from the ocean.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/R80qOagsm9D4vrP2gElaB1G0HG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-08-03","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Psychic TV: Black Joy","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
