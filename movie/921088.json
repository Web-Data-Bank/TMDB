There are squirrels that can glide through the air, outwit rattlesnakes and survive the coldest temperatures of any mammal. We uncover the extraordinary abilities of these cheeky characters, putting their problem solving to the test on a specially designed assault course. We team up with some of the world's top squirrel scientists who are making groundbreaking discoveries - from the fox squirrel who can remember the location of 9,000 nuts to the grey squirrel whose tree-top leaps are the basis of new designs in robotics. We also see the world through the eyes of an orphan red squirrel called Billy, as he grows up and develops all the skills he will need to be released back to the wild. It is time to meet the animal family we should never underestimate - the supersquirrels.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qb7pchX8IH6fuFH1TBALx7rfFN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Super Squirrels","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
