So much so that hooking up with stranger Dante Colle on the side of the road in the middle of the night is the ultimate turn on as they paw and maul each other in the woods. A short altercation results in Aiden being pushed to the ground before something comes out of the woods and encounters Dante! Aiden is then found the next morning, naked and in the woods by (Brooklyn Gray) who carries her away to safety. As expected, the police want to investigate but will Detective Tommy Pistol be able to find out what happened during the Blue Moon Rising? Fast and hot outdoor action starts this series off with a bang as Aiden and Dante continue their flaming hot screen chemistry from last years A Killer on the Loose.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mn9iMx0f7xyEieRPGcisNGk7BLJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111525,"logo_path":"/gbY2zC7Pp2lAXoDTQPKJKyISUwf.png","name":"MissaX","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-09-11","revenue":0,"runtime":157,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Blue Moon Rising","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
