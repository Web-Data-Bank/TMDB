After eight seasons on Saturday Night Live and a record-setting 153 episodes everyone knew his name – but very few people knew him. Because despite his well-known warmth and generosity, Hartman was constantly disappearing into his SNL characters, the cartoons he voiced and finally into a marriage that ended in murder. Though his career was cut short by violence Hartman has left us with a wealth of performances both hilarious and poignant. Adding in the voices of friends, loved ones and colleagues, Phil Hartman: Behind Closed Doors reveals a man of intense intelligence, dedication and talent—man known by few but loved by many.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/syI6BOV4UGBrZncNfVptmxJQlzo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":49664,"logo_path":null,"name":"ReelzChannel","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2018-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":88,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Phil Hartman: Behind Closed Doors","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
