Meet Lucz Padilla, she's quieter, religious, and nude, she works at a designer fashion label company in Mexico. Their lives are turned upside-down when these two young nudists are deported to the country of Nudeland where they can finally live with others that are not Clothes-minded. But even amongst the unique personalities and over-the-top characters (like a reverse Flasher running around) can our heroes ever truly get rid of the shame and anxiety inside and allow themselves to be free? Sure, nude isn't lewd, but it can come with mental baggage.","popularity":2.628,"poster_path":"/qj4157n0ty3AOG7b0JfNUu5PQJA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"NAKED AND NOT AFRAID","title":"The Nudels of Nudeland","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
