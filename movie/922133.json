The disease is called Amusia. It exists but nobody knows about it and it tortures her but nobody believes it. She had a lonely childhood which she spent defending herself from accusations and prejudice. The disease, and lack of acceptance, push her to run away, finding herself in a forgotten suburban neighbourhood. There she befriends a boy who is fighting his own solitude through music as he tries to prevent his own dreams from rotting away.","popularity":0.723,"poster_path":"/j1rr46xszUnWTjaSZ1c3QH5JOvJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":167187,"logo_path":null,"name":"UMI Films","origin_country":""},{"id":155990,"logo_path":"/py9VaywwK6KVi94YwrxSKVg1gkh.png","name":"RAI Cinema","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2022-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":91,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Amusia","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
