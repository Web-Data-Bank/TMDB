In the 1960s the New Zealand Government expressed concern about overpopulation, and instigated the Tokelau Islands Resettlement Scheme. This National Film Unit documentary surveys Tokelau society and culture from a New Zealand perspective, and follows the journey of a group of Tokelauans who chose to migrate to Aotearoa (where they adapt to telephones and horses near Te Puke). It was one of three NFU documentaries directed by Derek Wright on Pacific Island subjects.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":7700,"logo_path":null,"name":"New Zealand National Film Unit","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"},{"iso_3166_1":"TK","name":"Tokelau"}],"release_date":"1970-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Atoll People","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
