Collecting 'jewels' they set them in specially-built showcases and some even paint the walls with mashed berries. If all this isn't enough to woo potential mates, they also perform a most bizarre stiff-winged dance. But displaying darker emotions associated with sex, such as envy and jealousy, males will sometimes destroy a rival's construction and steal his jewels.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hXIrs7GTTp8TdUBPOlKJaLg5WZQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-12-17","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bowerbirds: The Art of Seduction","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
