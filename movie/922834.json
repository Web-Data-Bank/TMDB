Kirk is backed by extraordinary side musicians including legendary bassist Niels-Henning Ørsted Pedersen, drummers Alex Riel and Daniel Humair, and long-time pianist Ron Burton who keep the fire and swing burning throughout Rahsaan’s blazing workouts. This collection also includes two different renditions of “Three For The Festival,” arguably Kirk’s most spectacular performance piece, showcasing Rahsaan as a thunderous acrobatic player whose multiple horn work was all jazz and no gimmick.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2Htq8C8i5RkfMxmSTi387BwGCoX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2008-09-30","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Jazz Icons: Rahsaan Roland Kirk Live in '63 & '67","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
