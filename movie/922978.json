Initially acting upon an instinctive impulse to document and be guided by the events of the movement through quiet participation, Cohen’s documentation took a more public and expansive form through an agreement with the IFC Center, a local movie theater. In a nod to the once prevalent practice of screening newsreels in theaters before showtimes, a number of Cohen’s Newsreels were activated there as the events of the movement played out nearby, connecting immediate political documentation with the public sphere. The series approaches the events during the Occupy Wall Street Movement through an observational but atmospheric perspective, documenting the stir within the streets and Zuccotti Park, collective actions, police intervention and the sheer presence of the occupation which lasted fifty-four days.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hRDPy20R5onRvXiRcKKrN8ACH4R.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gravity Hill Newsreels: Occupy Wall Street","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
