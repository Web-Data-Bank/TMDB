A very good disc, I advise everyone. Although at first I was terribly upset, looking at a huge audience of people as much as one hundred and fifty, no less ... But then I remembered that a lot of groups finally performed in the studio, and nevertheless they recorded quite a blur of discs ... Here the option is different: the guys worked hard before an audience, albeit a small one.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rHqTtACTJFRhobfx0m7B1ZhekCQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":139,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Karcius - Live In France","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
