Unbeknown to them their father is Wotan, chief of the gods, who through Siegmund hopes to retrieve a ring of ultimate power.  Following Longborough Festival Opera’s critically acclaimed Das Rheingold, Wagner’s epic tale of Der Ring des Nibelungen continues with Die Walküre, conducted by Longborough’s Music Director Anthony Negus, ‘who probably knows The Ring better than any other living British conductor’ (The Times) and semi-staged by Amy Lane. The predominantly British cast shows several generations of great Wagnerian singers at their best.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9qEDX5aCMMKECX8qwyZ96eihqJA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Die Walküre - Longborough","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
