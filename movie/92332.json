Teil - Das Brillantenschiff","overview":"When last we saw Kay Hoog (millionaire adventurer, courageous hunk), he’d been beset with tragedy. Having escaped an ancient Incan city by the skin of his gleaming teeth, Hoog looked forward to a few years of settled life with his (amicably) captured Incan lovely, Naela. But the past struck quickly. Hoog’s arch-nemesis, the homicidal femme Lio Sha, murdered Naela on the very grounds of Hoog’s estate, prompting him to swear revenge upon her and her criminal organization, the Spiders. Now he must find them, as the Spiders continue their global quest for the Buddha-head Diamond. The head, it’s said, has the power to restore Asia to world dominance.","popularity":2.672,"poster_path":"/85nqhAJmPiiJxmNYm0erpvv8qxh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":55,"logo_path":null,"name":"Decla Film Gesellschaft Holz \u0026 Co.","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1920-02-06","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Spiders - The Diamond Ship","video":false,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":27}
