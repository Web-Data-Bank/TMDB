Always inappropriate in his re-appropriation of found materials Kline brings the private and public realms together in the creation of a drive-in cinema and a child's discovery of a satan-worshipping cult. A marriage of Messe Noire (1928) and the Irish landscape captured from various formats including 16mm through a custom-designed telecine apparatus and finished in an anaglyph 3D process, The Curse of Johnny Kline stands alone in contemporary Irish underground cinema.","popularity":0.657,"poster_path":"/5Pm1FbiVeLDllPxMNSf1yCQITuO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-04-29","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Curse of Johnny Kline 3D","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
