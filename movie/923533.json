At the University of California, Santa Cruz, UCSC, where I went to college, there were many fans of The Grateful Dead. They called themselves Deadheads. I had not heard of the band before attending the school. I listened to the music, and I didn't understand why people felt so passionately about the band. I was intrigued. So in 1986, I decided to try and understand these people and the music they loved, and to create a video of my quest. This documentary project is the result. Enjoy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qvLisJA60904bF2xK2sPZvgJAj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"a short and entertaining film about the fans of the Grateful Dead","title":"DEADHEADS","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
