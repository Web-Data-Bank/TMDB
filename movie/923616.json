These people have no life, just to live.  Xiaoyan, who has cancer, lives in a small hotel and waits for a bed in the hospital. Their simple understanding is: being able to live in the hospital represents a chance of life. In order to survive, I waited for more than two months, and finally, it was my turn to be hospitalized, but most of the hospitalization fees raised at the beginning were used to buy medicine. Zi Xiu, who took care of Xiaoyan, had to join the drug testing industry. In exchange for Xiaoyan’s chance of survival.  In the film, scammers defrauded life-saving money for cancer patients, unfilial men refused to treat the elderly and maliciously deducted commissions from testers and other heinous behaviors.  The rhythm of the film is like an illness tormenting patients, slow and profound.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ue8QmlRbBwBAYci6N9WIQmIW7Is.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"December Swallow","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
