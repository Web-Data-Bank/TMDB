A lieutenant and a director force them to confront authority, as well as their own essence. Authority in art and authority in war. When does exercising power becomes equal to the abuse of power? What is the role of the victimizer and that of the victim, when everyone is free to “manoeuvre” in their attempt to attain their goals? However, as they venture a manoeuvre, the social system interferes, limiting their freedom and depriving themselves of their ability to govern their own selves.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7mzSpWamgCv97pP2JvKB4jjDE5v.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-05","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Greek","iso_639_1":"el","name":"ελληνικά"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Manoeuvres","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
