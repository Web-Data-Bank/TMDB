As homage to Death of a Stone Cell, the film is structured into ten segments; each led by the first lines of the first ten stanza of the poem. Correspondences between the poet and his friends are incorporated throughout, taking the audience back and forth between Lofu's youth and middle age, only to eventually depict a full picture of the protagonist. The camera follows Lofu on his trips back to the bomb shelter and tunnel in Kinmen and his hometown Hengyang in Hunan Province of China, while also capturing his daily life in his adopted country of Canada. Acclaimed as the \"Wizard of Poetry\", Lofu shares through the film of the most insightful reflections.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wU0rlANaNEngShYYTyA41W465em.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-18","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"River Without Banks","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
