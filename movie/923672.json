The demon slaying priest and Sister Jordan Merrick (a scantily clad nun) get more than they bargained for when summoned by the Queen Of Hell to bring justice to the Hades dimension. Action filled, twisted, very dark, horrific, bloody, perverted and most of all - a very artistic film revealing the darker sides of filmmakers Melantha Blackthorne and Jason Cavalier.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7mmQXhShBjxs8upfxT9Wk45IhoJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":167439,"logo_path":null,"name":"Robomonkey Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-07-25","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"He's a cop for god, walking a beat in hell.","title":"Sinners and Saints","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
