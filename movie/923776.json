They learn that the standard American diet — high in fat, sugar and salt and low in fiber and nutrients — is the culprit behind many chronic illnesses.  With hope, they discover this epidemic of diseases — heart disease, Type 2 diabetes, obesity, and high blood pressure — may be reversible. By embracing the benefits of a whole-food, plant-based diet, they’re able to improve or reverse their chronic conditions and find renewed energy and vitality. Weaving together personal stories and evidence-based science, PlantWise puts forward an inspiring message of hope.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ArpnHqcJPWgTCqC1RUpD0t1DLAN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-01","revenue":0,"runtime":48,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Eat for Health, Eat for Life","title":"PlantWise","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
