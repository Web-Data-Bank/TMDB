In one sense it is a visual experimental journey that discovers and plays with the notions of the celluloid surface, the ways specifically it can be physically manipulated. In another sense it is a study of image and sound, every visual detail is paired with its own unique sound sample which creates an almost hypomanic sensation where even the smallest detail takes on a new sense. The work also questions decay in a literal sense but also beyond the surface, the degradation of a medium and a time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lMLUVPm5LpC04gNhNVfB8M7FzCp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Surface II","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
