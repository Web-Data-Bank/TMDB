The combination of the photomontage and text represents women’s labor, expressed through uniforms and clothes, and women who were sexually objectified, conveying feminist discourses and disciplines. The chased man never understands the existence or content of the images and texts. The blunt presentation of women’s unheard voices and objectified bodies, and the excessively-visualized images, demand immediate introspection.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hf1WtnvADVUNDkm0yUBrnaEFm2w.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cut-out","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
