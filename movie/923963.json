The success of this film showed me that the concepts ‘worked’. Thus, for me, theory is not a dead demonstration. A living theory must be drawn from a personal experience.\"\r - Michel Chion","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rEy1PUElzSLbUqMU7dDMFQbLflk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-01-06","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eponine","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
