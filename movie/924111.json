This sets off a chain of events that will affect the whole city. He's a rock star activist on a secret mission, she's a bohemian who wanders the streets at night, handing out books to the homeless. Every Thursday evening, she meets Constance and Eugène in their small candlelit apartment, for their weekly reading ritual. Constance broadcasts her live-sampled, politically conscious sound art on an independent radio station; Eugène has been working on a novel for years, whilst trying to shut himself off from the outside world. The three young friends all dream of their own poetic revolution, inspired by the situationists, on whom Raoul has modelled his persona.","popularity":0.926,"poster_path":"/7UGf3Q0WeJT3ow3328MElzwkXlP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2022-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Dream and the Radio","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
