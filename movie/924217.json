A school girl sees her private life made public when she invites a classmate, who is an online influencer, to her home. A divorced man with financial troubles so much wants to show his young daughter he can be a good father, that he fails to see the precarious position he is manoeuvring himself into. And a poet and commentator risks losing herself and those she loves in her desire to use her fame to achieve social change.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yEgOuhWR0KVJyht1JJOpWDtY5Gb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2022-01-26","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Xhosa","iso_639_1":"xh","name":""},{"english_name":"Zulu","iso_639_1":"zu","name":"isiZulu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hyperlink","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
