Focusing on the insular Celtic language Breton, the work is a reflection of the deprivation of heritage that happens when an orally transmitted culture is heavily discouraged, almost to the point of extinction, by the government. In part a fictional collective memory, in part an attempt to reconnect with my family history, the film is Brittany as I have come to know it as an adult.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/u9y7HFbM2t7lsob4aukqMwcEWfo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-05-24","revenue":0,"runtime":2,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Penn-ar-Bed","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
