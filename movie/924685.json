The film was shot on Super8 and hand processed, however, an accidental misloading of the film led to much of it becoming stuck together, obscuring the exposed images underneath the film material. The music is written in response to the material quality of the film form, with tones and melody revealing themselves as identifiable images appear and are lost.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dean Quarry - with eyes that are not seen are quickly forgotten","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
