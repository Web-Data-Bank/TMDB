I find a sense of belonging in nature; a space where I can rest and return to myself, away from the restlessness of urban life and the fractious relationship I feel towards our social structures. For me, the marshland landscape embodies that personal experience. It is rich in nature, yet the urban environment is ever present, pushing at its edges. A reminder that Iâ€™ve not left that world, or that part of me, behind.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fsrjL3AqCFkeXFmkZCwlW9su2mV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-09","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"FRACTURED LANDSCAPE","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
