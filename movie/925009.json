The East Frisian island in Lower Saxony's Wadden Sea may only be 18 square kilometres in size, but it offers everything you need: unspoiled nature, kilometres of beaches and the endless expanse of the sea.  Hiddensee's diverse beauty with rugged cliffs and snow-white sandy beaches is presented over an area of just under 19 square kilometres. The mixture of charming landscape and almost meditative tranquillity has been attracting celebrities and artists here since the 1920s.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5Abid7jVe4RCULbFPn0IDlqWlkl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7201,"logo_path":"/ljV8ZT3CIYCEIEDlTyBliXJVCZr.png","name":"NDR","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Spiekeroog and Hiddensee mit Judith Rakers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
