In 1966, four years before his death, Newsday lauded him as \"second to Chaplin as a film artist because his work inaugurated a new stage in a medium long dominated by Disney.\" Trnka continues to astound audiences to this day, particularly those discovering this amazing animation for the first time. This collection includes five of the master's shorts and his feature-length classic \"The Emperor's Nightingale\" based on Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tale and narrated by Boris Karloff.
