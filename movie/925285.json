The film is a non-sequential account of personal narratives and reminiscences ruptured by violence, undermined by erasure and over-ridden by official documents that challenge truth. Made over nine years it explores memory as a mode of resistance, constantly confronting and morphing- from the personal to political, individual to collective. It looks at the ways in which those affected by violence have no choice but to remember.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5phJxrSeys4GuryfeUidcAhY3fN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-10-07","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Khoon Diy Baarav","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
