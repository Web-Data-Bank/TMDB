She and his group of friends had been shooting a short film for the Final Project, but—for some reason during the production process—the result of the film turned out to be poor. Gita was blamed by his group of friends. Then all of Gita's friends decided to resign from the Final Assignment trial because they felt too embarrassed if their bad film was shown to the public in the courtroom later. But Gita still wants to continue to the trial stage, because she has to pass this semester, so she is intimidated in such a way by her friends.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Director, Isn't She?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
