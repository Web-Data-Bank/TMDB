This movie will make the viewer feel. The painting is designed in a typical Asian style. The plot is built around two brothers. One of them is mentally ill, and the other can hardly be called \"normal\". Both brothers dream of the same thing. Rob the bank and leave the city. One chose Mexico and the other chose Hollywood. He dreams of becoming an actor. But their plans were not destined to come true. The ending of the film will make even the most staunch admirers of thrillers shudder. The mood of the picture and the denouement are very reminiscent of the vivid works of modern cult Asian directors.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jTz5qb4BRe4MVovFcsri2QzIzgM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":124735,"logo_path":null,"name":"Almazfilm","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":189879,"logo_path":null,"name":"20:06 pictures","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2004-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":37,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"«My love is a magic phrase»","title":"My Love...","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
