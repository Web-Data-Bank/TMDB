Roving, dismembered voices – messages left for the filmmaker by former lovers, found voice messages made on gramophone discs – hunt for image-bodies, creating a simultaneous presence and absence: a woman carried gently by the flow of a Lazy River; the undulations of a darkened, glimmering dance party; memories and traces of the once-massive Iowan prairies. The film explores polarities such as public and private, nature and culture, near and far, bios and techne, producing a space in which technologies of intimacy, separated by historical measurements of time, can coalesce in perpetuity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/m3RaglAoUUbJF7bhSUabM3oIBNN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-01-27","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Histories of Simulated Intimacy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
