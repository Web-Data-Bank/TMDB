Smith garnered yet another Grammy nod last Friday with a nomination for ‘Best Contemporary Christian Music Album’ for his latest worship effort, ‘Surrounded.’  Dubbed ‘35 Years of Friends: Celebrating The Music of Michael W. Smith,’ music lovers will experience over 35 artists, from all genres, performing a set list to include many of Smith’s 35 #1 hit singles. In addition, 2018 marks the 35th Anniversary of Smith’s Top 10 single “Friends,” which helped introduce his music to both secular and non-secular audiences. Smith once again shared the song with the world when he performed it at the Washington, D.C. memorial service for his dear friend, President George H.W. Bush, last Wednesday.","popularity":1.102,"poster_path":"/n8Fag3AvMXuq77UWx01fl1Xv4PR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":167668,"logo_path":null,"name":"Conway Entertainment Group","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":117,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Over 35 Artists Will Celebrate 35 #1 Hits and the 35th Anniversary of “Friends”","title":"35 Years of Friends: Celebrating the Music of Michael W.
