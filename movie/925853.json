It is the moment when these elements come together during the bloody match that the real drama begins.\r With a richly sensory approach that embeds the viewer within the action of the arena, Tajen is a poetic visual evocation of the intimacy, brutality, and festivity of the fight. While neither approving nor decrying this tradition, the film immerses the viewer into the visual and auditory domains of steel, feathers, blood and the money that defines Tajen.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ga54mZitFWxcClqVRFbipCkPKKB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2017-11-02","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A sensory ethnography on the Balinese cockfight","title":"Tajen","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
