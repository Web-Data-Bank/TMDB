In this desolate industrial complex, fear of an attack that never seems to come by an enemy that perhaps does not exist has morphed into a sort of serene paranoia. Military training has congealed, becoming a series of bizarre, animalistic rituals; punishment for minor infractions ranges from shovelling excrement to death by thirst. When at last there is dim evidence that the North is mobilising its troops, it becomes apparent that dogma now trumps truth, compassion and common sense.","popularity":0.854,"poster_path":"/ub7hP5D1BDubRj3e3qySEhAOKCx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2362,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bo Films","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":47606,"logo_path":null,"name":"Volya Films","origin_country":"NL"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AM","name":"Armenia"},{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"BG","name":"Bulgaria"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2023-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Luka","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
