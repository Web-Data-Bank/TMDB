PEACE PARK is his first feature length documentary film, which shows an uncensored insider’s perspective of the communities that frequent the park and their struggle to survive Montreal’s attempts to gentrify its red-light district. It explores the ways the city and corporate interests view the people in the park, and looks at the way the two communities (the lifers and the skateboarders) manage to share the space through tolerance and respect.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wxU54QBkiZtS3IQV9v766iR0JlH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-07-31","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Peace Park","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
