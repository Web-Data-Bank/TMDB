Burning crosses and fireworks adorn many of the dilapidated sets, which fit in perfectly with the Halloween season. “30 years of blasphemy and bring on 30 more! What better night than All Saint’s Eve to celebrate this most unholy anniversary than with us, as we present the most ambitious project of our career to date, ‘XXX Years Ov Blasphemy,'” Behemoth frontman Nergal said in a statement to Blabbermouth. “Legions, when I say this is the ultimate cinematic Behemoth experience, I cannot express how much I mean that. Another huge risk for us, but as always, we go feet first and push our limits. The result will be a sight to behold. We’ll see you in The Forest…and more!”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3DqTOIs0D7Eq0CZeaMhtzgA5ueU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Behemoth - XXX Years Ov Blasphemy","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":1}
