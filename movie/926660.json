The plot revolves around two guys from the outskirts who create a new life, following the recipes of the ancient alchemists. We are not aware of their motives, we do not know why and why they decided to do this. It remains only to closely monitor how they methodically, step by step, repeat the mysterious recipe of Paracelsus, extracting each ingredient, conducting with it all the necessary manipulations. Mystical experience surrounded by familiar household scenery turns into a theater of the absurd.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1TFhzrC3ocfTyTEhKl17yMP6Umm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-07-04","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Homunculus","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
