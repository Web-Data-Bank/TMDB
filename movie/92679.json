While the opening narration specifically recalls the events and tragic conclusion of BOXER, this one is set 20 years later in the same section of Shanghai but otherwise has nothing to do with the events or characters of the previous film.","popularity":1.646,"poster_path":"/olnMdMunyQzZdizsH8hlAObhTJk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5798,"logo_path":"/tmuI9BGXgpWLmokhlxpnG3IGNQB.png","name":"Shaw Brothers","origin_country":"HK"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"1972-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"No one could bend him... not even the KUNG-FU KILLERS!","title":"Man of Iron","video":false,"vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":6}
