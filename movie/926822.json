In the lower half, a close-up of two hands form a circle out of a metal rod. The upper half of the screen is vertically divided into two parts. On the right, a concurrent view of bending the rod with the entire body is visible in high contrast black and white. On the left is the green trace of an oscilloscope. A sine wave tone is first heard corresponding with the static green trace, a horizontal line. I drone a ‘similar’ tone that together with the sine wave changes the trace into a wavering circle. The steadier the sound I make, the steadier the circle. As I expend more energy bending the rod to ‘copy’ the electronically generated circle, my voice struggles to maintain pitch. Consequently the circle vibrates, collapses and morphs into multiple forms, mirroring the strain of my voice.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Full Circle","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
