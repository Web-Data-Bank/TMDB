Stranded amongst suburban streets named after prize-winning Holstein cows, this monumental cathedral now sits, unfinished and private. Teenage zombies emerge from lakes and rivers around Serpent River First Nation, once poisoned with uranium waste. There is talk of eugenics at a Holstein pageant, and a retired dairy farmer and his wife remember a recurring dream where their work is never done.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/r3QY3leoDz7r20sPkrmNnwpVf4o.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"IR","name":"Iran"}],"release_date":"2022-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Surface Rites","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
