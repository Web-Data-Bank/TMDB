In 1994, a local referendum at Gongliao, where the nuclear power plant was to be built, was held and 96% of voters voted against its construction. Chung Mong-hong combined images from the resistance with that of Taiwan's local festivities and religious ceremonies. Juxtaposed in an experimental style and accompanied by Christian chants, these images appear fragmented but reference each other, before transitioning to a more social realist style. The work depicts the shifting urban landscape of Taipei, capturing the collective memories of the locals, demonstrating Chung’s unique and astute observation of the society.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"1994-12-31","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Festival","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
