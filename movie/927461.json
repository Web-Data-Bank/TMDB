One Duchess is wife Allison Moorer. Her wonderfully roughened voice gave Earle's mix of country, folk, Americana and rock an additional, soulful touch. This 75-minute performance ranged from the latest album \"I'll Never Get Out of This World Alive\" to his beginnings 25 years ago with \"Guitar Town\" - including a few political stings in the direction of George W. Bush or oil spill cause BP, but also a declaration of love to his adopted home of New York.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2011-11-12","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Steve Earle & The Dukes and Duchesses: The AVO Session Basel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
