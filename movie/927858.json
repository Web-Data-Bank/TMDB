In fast single-frame mode, images change separated by black. Individual objects appear for varying lengths of time and are repeated in the same shot a different number of times. The black shots, like the images, are made up of precisely counted single frames. As a result, a rhythmically alternating sequence of images is produced, which, due to the interruption by black, causes the so-called flicker effect.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5IG63IHlCZlr8dpyTd4Utl1tg0D.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Objekte (Flickerfilm)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
