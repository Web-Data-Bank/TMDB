Ewa is an English teacher and translator, but she is hired as a caregiver for an elderly lady, whom she is to entertain with reading and conversation. Eryk works at a university, but is more interested in helping those in need rather than in literature, which - just like his quick temper - causes him a lot of problems. They both have difficult personalities and feel that they don’t get as much from life as they deserve. There could be more points of contact - a shared past or future?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ziO2lMh2BLjdRnmBhwxNPeVouB3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"}],"release_date":"2022-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Haven’t Lost Our Way","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
