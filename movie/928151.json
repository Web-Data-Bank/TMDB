Everything has a year of Insta teasers and “trailers” as if it won’t be forgotten the day it gets bumped five spaces on a YouTube subscription feed. Bronze has been the northeast’s most influential thinktank for over half a decade now, and that comes right down to them not being dicks about “teasing” everyone with an upcoming video. Unlike less #relevant institutions, they didn’t need a decade to drop a two-minute clip of falls. Enron just came out with no hype, on a quiet Sunday night while everyone waited for the rain to start. It’s every bit as good as you expect it to be :)  This one is perhaps a bit heavier on the “video art” side of things than even Solo Jazz, but at least there’s a totally *hot* Brendan Carroll part, not to mention some other new faces within the Bronze franchise.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1TXjcboInGqR9eydnU42zp2Fm5w.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-07-13","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bronze 56K - Enron","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
