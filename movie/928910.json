When Marc hurries into the reception room he is greeted by a gentleman of prepossessing appearance, who, after a warm handshake, introduces himself as the agent of the Silver Sucker mine. He has heard that Mr. Marc is seeking a profitable investment and was advised by a friend of Mr. Marc's to see this latter. The gentleman offers other credentials, but the mention of the friend's name is enough for the unwary Marc, and he refuses to put the gentleman to such an inconvenience. At length it is arranged, and Marc informs the gentleman that if he will call at his office at 2 o'clock they will close the deal. Mr. Marc wears a beard, and on his way downtown he suddenly resolves to shave.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":5109,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Essanay Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1910-09-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Close Shave","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
