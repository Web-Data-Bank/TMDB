The phenomenon exists almost only as a rumor, in rural areas, when the user inhales reproduced gas emitted by his own body waste. This reproduced gas is actually methane, also known as swamp gas, one of the materials that largely contributes to ozone depletion. I filmed myself doing it in various ways with my own excrement on the side of the road, for three weeks. This action uses the body as a drug lab, and expresses an exaggerated form of ecological ideas, resulting in an animalistic perversion.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8Af7E0ddIwbEGrSMePCVQPRcT2k.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2019-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Butthash","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
