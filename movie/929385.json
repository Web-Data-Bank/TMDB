And in 1988, Tom Capone and Kevin Egan took their seven song demo recorded in their hometown of Holbrook, NY and brought it to Some Records on the Lower East Side of Manhattan. From there, everything took off. WHAT AWAITS US, A Beyond Story is a documentary that, not only chronicles the history of the New York Hardcore band, Beyond, including their origin, their adventures and their demise after recording what is now considered an iconic record, but also depicts Egan's journey from New York to California as he tries to figure out where Beyond fits into his life today. The film includes interviews with members of the band, along with interviews with members of Quicksand, Gorilla Biscuits, Youth of Today, Judge, Burn, Bold and more.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lyAUhq7GBAjtZy26qPHjrWbKGxv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":168335,"logo_path":null,"name":"One Kind Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"WHAT AWAITS US: A Beyond Story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
