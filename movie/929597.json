A fictional acceptance researcher tries to mediate between the fronts of the anti-nuclear movement and the police. With his sociological lectures, the committed scientist often contrasts the political utopia of the opponents of nuclear power with the given political reality in a tongue-in-cheek manner. Exciting ironic-self-critical nuances in the documentary material, which shows the turbulent events in the Wendland in the 1980s.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":168367,"logo_path":null,"name":"Wendl√§ndische Film-Cooperative","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Zwischenzeit","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
