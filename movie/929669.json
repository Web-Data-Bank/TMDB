As a young girl, marriage to her older cousin leads to years of control and frustration. Rebelling against her husband, she eventually relocates to France with her sons, building a new life. As she voices her own story, the film weaves her experiences together into a broader narrative of self-determination. She carves out her independence in suburban Paris and finds comfort in the everyday. A simple kind of happiness follows, the sparrow is free.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/e8Y17731alCfiuPw3l9LbsVySSI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-07-01","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Sparrow is free","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
