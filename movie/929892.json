A slapstick comedy about two girls who make a bet to see who will get a boyfriend first. The daily lives of the girls are depicted in an amusing manner, almost in a dotsuki manzai style. The sheer energy of the \"life-sized girls,\" played by the author herself, breaks through the fiction of the story, and the dynamism of their bodies and words is very refreshing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cNe7OSyeHfLLQHO6CYfJNSyR8Dj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":168427,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ichioka High School Film Club","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"SUMMER OF '85","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
