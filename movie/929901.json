Not wanting to miss the moment, the camera clung desperately to the tree, trying to get as close to the target as possible. The camera's breath is vividly conveyed on the screen of the same recording, and along with the tragic cries of the cicadas that have fallen prey to the mantis, we are forced to experience three minutes of tension. At the end, the artist's bloodied leg is painful.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fv7hsXVXHuKKu3BSURV8BuutePy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A CICADA","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
