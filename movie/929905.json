The fragmentary images of the various women are chained together in a discontinuous manner, and as a whole, a dry eroticism with ambiguous meaning drifts from the screen. The laughter, murmurs, and screams of the women overlap to form a unique internal world that the artist, a woman, has captured with her physiological sensibility. A film that attempts to confirm the uncertainty of our existence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ljjLndIocOu6HgEmlB5tiGJ0xSy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Pool for Rain","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
