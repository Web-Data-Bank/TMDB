She’s been trying to write her bachelor’s thesis for years. So we make a deal—to document her progress on film. It will help her structure herself and to keep her eye on the goal. Then it should definitely be manageable in six weeks! But it’s summer, it’s hot and she has to take care of her dog and her plants and yet again her mother has gone missing for months. Her circle of friends insists she must relax - no one functions under pressure - and Lisa gets carried away by the endless possibilities of procrastination. The intended documentation of progress turns into a kaleidoscope of inner conflicts.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-18","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Me Myself Andi","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
