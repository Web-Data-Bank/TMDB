The tasteful direction shows us the interaction between the rational discipline of the young man who happens to meet Eriko and her intuitive senses. The composition of the film is brilliant, as if a casual description can be traced back and brought to life when it is related to a later scene.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fud0xBIQS3afva9ATiyXsgLhQ1G.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1979-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"絵里子","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
