A film about the breakup of the group and another film shot on the same day. In the summer of 1978, a boy who is too absorbed in the stage and the movies gets his first menstrual period, and by making a film called \"Change Your Mood,\" he changes his mood and gets through his period. The power of showing the film as being about something familiar and then lifting it up to a fictional structure and putting everything that the filmmaker feels about the time period in which he lives into it is overwhelming. The power of this film is overwhelming to the viewer.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3xOknQUlN3tmNh5OaA6hVojPmaV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":168480,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hosei First High School Cinema de Himago","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"気分を変えて?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
