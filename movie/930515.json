As an erogenous center, the assh*le is situated beyond the anatomical limits imposed by sexual difference since it bears no immediate relation to procreational organs: “The anus’s task,” as Paul B. Preciado concludes in his Countersexual Manifesto, “is not directed toward reproduction, nor is it founded on the establishment of a romantic nexus. It generates profits that cannot be accounted for in a heterocentric economy. Through the anus, the traditional sex/gender representation system shits itself.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kOOcZqLoPoJUMjL37XhdUT6aQ3M.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2021-12-10","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Godasses - Part II: 5ildo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
