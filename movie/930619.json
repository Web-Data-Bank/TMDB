The film is the debut feature from Irish poet and photographer, O.P. Durkin, and is the first release from creative collective Nodrum.  The film was shot in 2019â€“20 commencing in north India in the mountain town of Minali and continues on a journey in an ancient bus, through the Indian continent to south Goa. The film uses a mixture of professional and amateur actors and crew and was in itself a journey of discovery for all involved. Filming finished just a few weeks before the world and the nature of human interaction changed with the global reaction to the COVID-19 virus.  The musical soundtrack comes from the shamanic binaural beats of MEYA.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oZpmqMbmqM9mqydf46belMSqplL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":168546,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nodrum","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"2020-12-18","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Take the trip...","title":"Bare Transit","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
