These are the reality of Narita's performance. He brutally cuts them out and composes the film based on his own theme. It is the sincerity of the cold, detached, painstaking images of his wrinkled, toothless mouth that make him seem so present, even though he has lost his job. Without using any dialogue, the director Nagasaki poetically condenses what he encounters in the small room, which is interesting because it allows us to discover something that we had not noticed in our daily lives.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zjN64f2JsvVKYSivyW9JNcXtNWC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"終りなき夜","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
