PRINCI” portrays how distressed human beings lean on their desire for intimacy and connection on chat apps, without any physical interaction. The personality-training AI chatbot app “Replika” and dating app “Tinder” specifically, became the inspiration for this music video. The First-Person point of view coupled with a “Pokémon GO”-like AR interface fills this journey with sorrow and uncertainty. As the story starts with a user (Sonia Calico) who refuses to update her AI chatbot (PRINCI), she desperately ventures to find the AI partner’s crystal avatar in limited time as the obsolete-version of the world around them starts to fall apart.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mia4zJ92znpWaO1JzKQwSmCX0bt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Change, Reset","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
