From then to 1997, they became one of the leading groups of the Italian and European independent music scene, carrying on a rigorous musical and existential path, based on the concepts of self-production and self-management, recording a dozen of fundamental records in the history of international hardcore punk. These are years of endless travel across Europe on a shabby van, sharing the alternative life experiences and the battles that animate the anarchist and antagonist movement: the struggle for home and for social spaces; the anti-militarism cause; the refusal of nuclear power; the anti-fascist resistance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1iYT3abo4ntslWJgwTLKjTHdLfY.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":168626,"logo_path":null,"name":"Korova Audiovisivi","origin_country":""},{"id":168627,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film Commission Vda","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I've Won I've Lost","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
