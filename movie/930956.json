A breakfast table. A woman taking a photograph. A woman's face as she smokes a cigarette. A woman in a nightgown. A dinner table at night. A scene from a car window. A naked woman tying her hair in front of a mirror. A woman frolicking in the sea. A woman drinking alcohol at night... As the title suggests, this work is made up of fragments of images that the artist took with his camera from time to time during this period. The material is limited to the artist's surroundings and the people around him, and the people are aware that they are being filmed, looking at the camera or smiling at the camera... In other words, they are looking at the artist behind the camera or smiling at the artist. The film records the gaze of the artist as well as the gaze directed at the artist. This is a valuable work that makes full use of the advantages of 8mm home movies.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cllwVZVt5Hvw4i7PdKauxUXRmrm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"'79・11～'80・3","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
