They search for each other amid various incidents such as incest, unemployment, and an encounter with a celestial maiden. The story is a melodramatic love fairy tale. The dialogues, tools, and ideas are all deliberately fake, but the fact that the entire film is dedicated to this makes it even more compelling. The space-fantasy ending is also enjoyable, as the nymph who fails to separate the two lovers and win the man bursts her beloved earth like a balloon, and the two become the creatures of a new planet. The original theme song by the two in a musical duet over the scenery of the new planet at the end is a highlight of the film.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gDlHoTvHHW7FGlCexjb4XoTPprW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":168630,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aichi Medical University Film Institute","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ねんねこりんりん","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
