There they met with rider Koichiro Uehara‘s crew of TIGHTBOOTH in Osaka, KUKUNOCHI in Yokohama, Takahiro Morita, the FESN & FATBROS crew in Nakano, Tokyo, and some of the many friends they made in Japan while visiting there for the past 6-7 years.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8C2bsU3hKSNndNWyv0YNWbdO5lN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Soleil Levant","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
