They are residents of \"Mahoroba,\" a place hugged by mountains and sheltered by snow. Winter, the girl in the grey coat, freezes her fingers in the falling snow to make a cold white tower. The girl in the yellow coat, Spring, is staring at her from a little distance. The winter girl in love with the snow is forever innocent. She will remain closed and eventually die. The girl in spring is saddened by this and destroys the winter girl's \"mahoroba\". The winter girl learns that she cannot resist the changing seasons. The day of adulthood is coming, but the innocence of Winter's youth prevents her from degrading herself, even to the point of death. The spring girl hugs the winter girl's shoulder. The colour of red blood can be seen through the cheeks of the girls. This is the beautiful myth of the girl's misery. Mahoroba, caged in the snow, will eventually be forgotten one day. Somewhere, the birds of spring are singing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cGIycZKNIn35adrvvGjrCYoy5Sn.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":168635,"logo_path":null,"name":"Amagirafu Family","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"まほろば","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
