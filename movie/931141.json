Giacomo Abbruzzese reconstructs his grandfather's story, immersing us in the New York of the 1960s, with Billy Joel's sounds and a gangster movie atmosphere.  Through the testimonies and memories of his relatives, on both sides of the ocean, we discover a mysterious, complex character, perpetually on the run. It is the portrait of a man that nobody ever really knew.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/twahl9Z5P9MqvKLwfopQclkyIxE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":79189,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Luna Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":115156,"logo_path":null,"name":"Maje Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2019-06-25","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"America","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
