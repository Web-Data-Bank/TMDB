It evolves through three narrative moments: the prologue, the central narrative, and the epilogue. The first materializes and at the same time rebels against the cultural construction of the \"cult of the Phallus\". In the second moment, we can see the formation of a network of protection and mutual help among women, exalting their bodies and their powers. And the last moment is practically a making off, with real scenes of all the women in the cast recording the video.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3vKXodVBvgFZYeciVkgkRGEJMm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":84297,"logo_path":null,"name":"Punta Colorada de Cinema","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"release_date":"2017-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"blasFêmea","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
