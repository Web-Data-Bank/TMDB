Sentenced to 25 years in prison, he ends up behind bars, where he has to fight for survival in the environment of recidivists sentenced for the most serious crimes. Deprived of hope for justice, isolated from those he loves, he must find the strength to survive and remain himself. Each day here is a fight to preserve dignity and humanity. It is a game for life, played according to extremely brutal rules. Sikora takes up this fight and cannot be broken. He learns to gain allies and friends, earn respect and maneuver between prison subcultures.

But key decisions are made far beyond the walls.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gfg19oGKh3DIkwiS3HznSvsOF04.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mój dług","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":12}
