It was originally made as a private thank-you gift from Ghibli to John Lasseter, the Lasseter-San of the title. The show appears similar to a home movie, or private documentary.  This footage includes snippets from some of Miyazaki's films, as well as some Pixar shorts. The most striking part were clips from Porco Rosso, interchanging with images of Miyazaki flying a red double-decker.","popularity":0.923,"poster_path":"/aseEArn89iC7ie8PiDOWEmGwnjT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10342,"logo_path":"/eS79pslnoKbWg7t3PMA9ayl0bGs.png","name":"Studio Ghibli","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":12424,"logo_path":null,"name":"TV Man Union","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2003-11-19","revenue":0,"runtime":155,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The More Than 20 Year Friendship Between Hayao Miyazaki and John Lasseter Behind Spirited Away's Academy Award Win","title":"Lasseter-san, Thank You","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
