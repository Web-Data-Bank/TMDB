Alongside the hypercars there was a full-grid of 25 LMP2 cars, 8 LM GTEPro and 23 LMGTE Am cars.  The shift of dates to August meant the weather may well play more of a part than in June, but with a full testing schedule already completed and the grid bursting with talent, there was every chance of a thrilling race, right down to the last few laps.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":237,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"24 Hours of Le Mans Review 2021","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
