The film captures the passage of time, forming layers of memory and revealing how the families’ dreams and expectations stand up to a grueling new reality on the other side of the world.  Since 1990, hundreds of thousands of Brazilians of Japanese descent have gone to Japan to work. This unique documentary brings to light the gripping personal stories behind a major transnational phenomenon.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sJ5dLEuNzGm1mrDMNnVC3WaT9c9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-07-10","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Day We Arrived in Japan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
