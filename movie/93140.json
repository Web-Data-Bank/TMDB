We meet some at Gibsonton, Florida, where carnival folk winter. They talk about their lives and accomplishments. The camera also goes on the road to visit a grandfather with a distinctive face, a legless mechanic from Kentucky on a second honeymoon in LA, a marathon runner and motivational speaker who has no feet, a karate student with partial limbs, and an armless, down-to-earth mom in Texas.","popularity":1.449,"poster_path":"/bz6zt7HyKulkJqZBVESvX1byGa1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":95627,"logo_path":null,"name":"Trans-Atlantic Enterprises","origin_country":""},{"id":10313,"logo_path":null,"name":"Astral Bellevue Pathé","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":24315,"logo_path":null,"name":"TMS Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1981-08-21","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The true story of a modern-day Elephant Man… and other human oddities.","title":"Being Different","video":false,"vote_average":5.667,"vote_count":3}
