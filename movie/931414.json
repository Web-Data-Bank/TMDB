I filmed the pictures on the screen while they were digitizing, and made my own editing with some kind of mystical connotation.  I intensified the strangeness of this place by working on the sound (radio interference) adding some furtive and quite ghostly apparitions of myself. When I watch this film now, I can think it has a lot to do with the horror movies which were my delight as a teenager. But it's more of a joke about this omnipotence artists are credited with by society â€” this idea of artists being able to venture on psychic territories that no one else can reach.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Neige pour media froid","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
