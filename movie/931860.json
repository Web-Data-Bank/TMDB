When her paths cross with Wei Dong, the son of a wealthy family headed by a notable judge, her life turns upside down. She falls in love with him at first sight, although he doesn’t really know what to make of her. Unfortunately, due to her father’s carelessness in causing a fire that damages the Weis’ property, she gets off on the wrong foot with Wei Dong and his family – and ends up having to work as the family’s maid.  Chen Miao hopes to win Wei Dong’s heart. The rest of the family is horrified by her lack of manners and hatches a plan to engineer a relationship between Wei Dong and a “more suitable” young woman from a similarly wealthy family. Chen Miao tries to change her tactics by adopting “polite” ways – creating more awkwardness. Despite all this, Wei Dong starts to wonder if he is falling for her unconventional charms!","popularity":6.326,"poster_path":"/347sQDPhK9i1yIW2tymzh46FBGI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":168304,"logo_path":null,"name":"Weilai TV Network Co., Ltd.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2018-05-13","revenue":0,"runtime":126,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oh, Pretty Woman","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
