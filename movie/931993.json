It is also the one that brings the greatest bondage to mankind. Hence the theme of my second film, people living on islands. We chose Penglai, Shandong, chartered a boat, spent about a month running around the Changshan Islands, and finally chose the farthest island from the mainland. The population of the island is about 1,000, and there are many more Work from abroad. I have always believed that the most important part of a film should be people's lives, not the plot. The plot that is divorced from life is unbearable, and the reason why I like documentaries is precisely because of this preference. Human behavior dictates everything, and if you look carefully, you will discover the many details of life that make up our complex lives and hint at everything that has happened and will happen.\" --Douban","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fNOfWfLX9GXNN2mpmws65RHkI37.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2002-08-09","revenue":0,"runtime":62,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Island","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
