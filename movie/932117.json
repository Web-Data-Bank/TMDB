Exploring the dynamism of emptiness in a realm where time and space are altered. Past, present and future are considered in the gaps in-between, blurring the boundaries between fact and fiction. Expressing emotions, ideas and concepts through literal and abstract imagery, through the creative use of editing and sound design incorporating Irish Sean NÃ³s song. Characters emphasize the fragile and emotional states of mankind, with prominence on dreamscapes and mindscapes. An oneiric land cinematically beautiful and psychologically disturbing. A world that explores significant topics such as death, loss, love, isolation and mental-fragility.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/39M1eaZHZ6hsyYmvtxt87PBgvXZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Flux","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
