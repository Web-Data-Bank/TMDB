Built like a nest, with the bare essentials, the film has a poetic dimension with its focus on the bird’s and children’s watchful observation and on a listening ear for their songs and flutterings. Home in the Air is not about aesthetics or anything premeditated, it’s a natural prayer of the soul, an ode to animal and human behavior. The sharp eye of a bird and the children’s voices off-camera give shape to this film which places itself somewhere between the Earthly and the Divine.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lg2coZf9G99w0uFL8teJeaDXsTc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":21,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hogar al Aire","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
