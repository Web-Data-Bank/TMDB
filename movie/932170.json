Originally shot in Super-8 film, S.He is a lyrical rumination on the dualities of male and female, sound and image, motion and stasis. Seaman shot an industrial landscape from the window of a moving train, isolating the architecture's sculptural elements and subtly altering the images with slowed and staggered motion. Seaman's hypnotic, chanted text is a litany of associative and metaphorical phrases that, through linguistic and symbolic associations, defines the elusive, genderless identity of the title.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"S.He","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
