Margaret Conneely (Chicago amateur filmmaker & CFA Collection namesake) frames stop-motion animation and trick photography with live action footage to fuel her very own Christmas fairy tale.  FAIRY PRINCESS (1956) was Margaret Conneely's most successful amateur film, winning a slew of local awards, and being named one of the Photographic Society of America's 'Ten Best films of 1956.' Conneely's film was also awarded the PSA's 'Harris B. Tuttle Trophy'; named after Eastman Kodak's innovator of the 16mm format, this trophy was awarded annually for the best amateur storytelling film on a family theme.  - Chicago Film Archives","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lDI6MGL51SkIUstyOz0oTUHvWY7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1956-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fairy Princess","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
