They're impatient with the time it's taking to pass the checkpoint, and grow increasingly concerned when a uniformed officer tells them to get out of the car for questioning. The couple is separated, each in their own interrogation rooms. Matthew is shocked when the officer tells him that illegal substances were found in the car and that Cindy implicated him. Though Matthew promises his innocence, it's standard practice for border patrol to do a full cavity search, and the officer intends to thoroughly follow protocol.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xlf0HRyLBeHPtECx0y7sLQIYU5q.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39430,"logo_path":"/nTVDw6jLNbYNzMONNJyPncboBJg.png","name":"Disruptive Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2021-07-20","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Point of Entry","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
