Her androgynous figure, her exceptional photogeny and her hieratic allure have inspired photographers and fashion designers alike and seduced the greatest rock stars such as David Bowie and Mick Jagger. This documentary film, rich in archives, skillfully mixes songs and confidences. It takes us on a fascinating journey through time, from the yéyé period to today, and into the artist's feelings.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/AgK8gxF7QdrhonZddh5cFJIVPjW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121241,"logo_path":null,"name":"MD Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Françoise Hardy, une icône","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
