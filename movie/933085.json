This makes Craig popular at school and allows Brock to exact revenge upon his emasculating ex-girlfriend, but it also damages Craig's budding relationship with a girl he may really like. Luther, a homicidal 70s-style drug kingpin, wants the formula, and comes to get it at GrooveTaco, the play-within-the-movie, an homage to lesbian assassin hookers written by Craig's psuedo-freudian drama teacher.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-04-20","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Luther’s Magic Weed","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
