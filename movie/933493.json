Ernie Bailey, one of the miners, relayed the story to director Karl Francis, but declined appearing in the film because HTV would not pay him on a scale comparable to Tom Jones. Mr. Bailey smoked to his dying day at the age of 99: always a staunch socialist.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2ATkCuj9I22O2ECqXXxKRxHslRf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-06-08","revenue":0,"runtime":49,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Breed of Men","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
