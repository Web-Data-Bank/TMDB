We open on a self-assured and poetic guide, whose sculptural hair is adorned in constellations. With her invitation, we dive into four ecosystems that reside within her, each with distinct movement, casting, color and sound worlds exploring four forms of Black joy. We return to our guide one final time to find her transformed. Touching on the divinity of the body, sisterhood, and being, BLACK.ECO invites us to experience Black fantasy as a shiny vehicle for transcendence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/osbmh3PYefd4EqRTE90cPGciomw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-07-14","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"BLACK.ECO","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
