Two friends from a small village decide to transform their mopeds into choppers and embark on a journey. Looking for freedom and love, they travel through dreams of the past and visions of the future. Driven by mad impulses and haunted by the conservative moulds of traditions, they start believing and understanding things previously unimaginable. On the road through Slovenia and Croatia - two countries that have just recently seceded from Yugoslavia - they are accompanied by a young runaway woman with a mysterious past and an old biker who has seen the world in search of freedom but has still not found it. They challenge themselves and each other through shared experiences, severing their ties with and conceptions of the old and thus making way for the new.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4Hs7srA30n3dkOtYl2Jeyvto86L.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9083,"logo_path":null,"name":"Staragara","origin_country":"SI"},{"id":81053,"logo_path":null,"name":"Antitalent Produkcija","origin_country":"HR"},{"id":127206,"logo_path":null,"name":"Novi Film","origin_country":"RS"},{"id":33367,"logo_path":"/2BjE2jPOtJfReNRbo6tfEpUfjbX.png","name":"SENSE Production","origin_country":"RS"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HR","name":"Croatia"},{"iso_3166_1":"RS","name":"Serbia"},{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"2022-08-15","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Riders/Spring Dreaming","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
