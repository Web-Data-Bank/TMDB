Neil Finn said, “We were truly blessed to be able to play 12 real live gigs in NZ, the band together after a year of lockdown, sensing the occasion and playing as if everything was brand new and full of wonder. We can’t wait to share this beautifully captured performance from Auckland with our fans around the world in anticipation of being on the stage for them in person once again.”  The band, comprised of Neil Finn, Nick Seymour, Mitchell Froom, Liam Finn and Elroy Finn, showcase tracks from their new record Dreamers Are Waiting, including singles Whatever You Want, To The Island and Playing With Fire alongside their legendary catalogue – Something So Strong, Don’t Dream It’s Over, Mean To Me, World Where You Live, and more.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kAsgC0UxZedhw7ZUFEfmwvIv7xL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":132,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Crowded House: Live From the Island","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
