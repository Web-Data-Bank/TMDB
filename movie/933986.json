Occasionally, they overflow onto the full screen.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"9 ½ weeks in 8 mins","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
