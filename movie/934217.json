Divided into three scenes of different durations and speeds, “promenade” immerses us from the start in a nocturnal atmosphere, dense than in universes alternately, confined, feverish, and finally contemplative; each is bathed in light and its own atmosphere. Only nuance, intermediate shots, on a dark sky where a moon is gradually extracted from the clouds which mask it. The whole punctuates with repetitive rhythms. Coming to the light, coming to the day, one thinks of course of the birth and the passage of life. The impression is only confirmed by a soothing finale facing the ocean.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Promenade","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
