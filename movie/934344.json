Deprived of their main source of income and finding it increasingly difficult to sustain themselves, the villagers who have consulted oracles and conducted \"frog-weddings\" are now desperately looking for a way out of their plight. An unusual solution presented by a priest seems like a possible cure for the curse and though reluctant at first, the villagers decide to go ahead with it for the greater good of the village. Village simpletons nicknamed Benga and Bengi, suddenly find themselves at the centre of the chaos that ensues - and it changes their lives forever.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iOHgrZQgIBg6dXT4NppO3KfigEz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18256,"logo_path":null,"name":"Saj Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2022-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Assamese","iso_639_1":"as","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Songs for Rain","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
