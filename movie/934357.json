In the 20th year of my life, I put the idea of making a short film into practice for the first time, and I cut a short film from my fragmented phone footage to commemorate the passing of 2020. During the first half of the year, I spent my days at home in fear, and my desperate inward search caused a break in my relationship with the outside world. During the second half of the year, I was led by the camera to reacquaint myself with the world. I went to a music festival for the first time and attended my first funeral; I began to care about the people and things around me, and discovered landscapes I hadn't noticed in my life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rlTHcBUDB9IxgWn8rmlvC7FeqEl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-12-11","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"No Echo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
