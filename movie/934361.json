However the director is not focused on the works of the government or the strike on the famous Maidan, but on an average small town, where the most important decisions are made. She carefully observes locals discussing politics on the street market, kids being thought how democracy works by their teacher; and young men, dressed in uniforms, going to war, not knowing if they will return. The film is a perfect example of how small-scale story make a big impact on the audience.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/43VmhqOAqaG1FDWK4HemDNvD4IL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2017-10-16","revenue":0,"runtime":64,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Almost 10.000 Voters","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
