He found his subjects in the dance halls, cabarets, circuses, and brothels of the Montmartre neighborhood, where middle-class visitors came for a whiff of excitement laced with danger. His images of performers at the Moulin Rouge, Chat Noir, and other fashionable nightspots transformed the poets, singers, and dancers of Montmartre  including Aristide Bruant, Jane Avril, and Yvette Guilbert  into celebrities. This film traces the relationship between the aristocratic painter and the avant-garde culture of Montmartre, using works of art by Lautrec and his colleagues, rare archival footage and sound recordings, period photographs, and interviews with contemporary scholars.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A0DigMpasMdxOAyDIzsx39sHsq5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Toulouse-Lautrec and Montmartre","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
