The first Gink who blew in wanted to know the correct time, and not a cent's worth did he buy. The next was one of those hurry-up guys who wanted a city directory and wanted to know if Murphy was spelled with an \"F.\" Shortly after Estelle came in and wanted to wait for Laura. She was dying for a drink of plain water, she couldn't drink soda water because the gas got up her nose. Finally, when Laura came she bought a postage stamp, and not having any pennies, said she'd be in later to pay for it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4bYDkdNuPcWVUNone3en377SIow.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5109,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Essanay Film Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fable 'Proving That Spongers are Found in a Drug Store'","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
