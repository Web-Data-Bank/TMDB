When I started to collaborate with Tierra Whack I quickly realized I'd found the perfect partner to help realize this unusual project. She immediately understood what I was trying to do, and by centering her life and identity, we were able to build a twisted world that lives alongside this world. In the world of our story, we explore alternative beliefs about technology, fame, conspiracies and the systems of power that have created a low level vibration of paranoia and fear- one that might be the defining feature of our moment.","popularity":0.633,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-03-11","revenue":0,"runtime":81,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cypher","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
