No matter how difficult the world may be, he is doing his best just to be afraid of being hospitalized by a doctor, even though it is the New Year when the whole of Japan is superficially conspicuous. Contact with a high school girl who was interested in his poetry did not change his melancholy outlook on life. A narcissistic reminiscent of the independent work \"I Am Sono Sion !!\", which was sensationally released by director Sono Sion, who captured the collapse and rebirth of the modern Japanese family in \"Noriko's Dinner Table\" to the utmost. There will definitely be someone who is attracted to the character of the main character. A world view that should be called the origin of independent films. If you get hooked here, it's no longer possible to control the rotation of your brain that keeps activating.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rfNZ4EIiforktIMz7xkNHz3dGNC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"シねない奴","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
