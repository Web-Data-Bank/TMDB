André, the father, has no more wishes. To feel free to be and to desire, he has to get rid of his money. Miss Canine, a financial domineering, snatched him from his daily hypocrisy. Doubts about his double life gradually contaminate his wife and his daughter. The newfound lucidity at a price. Behind the utopian world of the seaside resorts, it spreads like a virus and makes appearances disappear.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3qGp90JhQfC2AsWQ1Z1xhiLGCcr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72551,"logo_path":null,"name":"Les Artisans du Film","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-12-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Raging Royan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
