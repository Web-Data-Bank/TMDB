Its is an attempt to transpose the perception of the meditative state to the audiovisual medium, yet the film itself is an object of meditation that interacts with the audience as an experience, instead of a film. Due to this relationship, the experience is unique to every individual that is exposed to Esrime. It is a retreat that leaves room to the audience and takes them away from the fast-paced cycles of our current way of life while creating a space for reflection.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yKSYvfVy9W5o5dVPY4o1kJL4PS0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":122,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Esrime","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
