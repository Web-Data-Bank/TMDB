Maintaining the traditions of folk culture and folklore is not just a romantic look into the village society. The appeal of social reality is moving elements of the traditional way of life closer and closer to societal issues. Praus's film offers an essay about man who is constantly struggling for his own sense of being.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/A4utIiggT0XV7Yqh3YCghD7dK7B.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SK","name":"Slovakia"}],"release_date":"2016-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When Land Is Looking for Its Heaven","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
