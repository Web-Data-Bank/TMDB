The text is in three languages—Arabic, Norwegian, English—and describes the childhood nightmares and traumas of two generations of Palestinian refugees, where the trauma of the parents is reflected in the nightmares of their children. The imagery represents significant aspects of life, identity, and culture: landscape, harvest and traditional produce, energy resources, cooking techniques, representations of generations, birth and death. Most importantly the image travels, restless, on and on, searching through the two contrasting countries, through the mapped landscape with its changing borders and renamed countries.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shifting Inheritance","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
