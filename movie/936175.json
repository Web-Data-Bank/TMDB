Ignoring the family festivities, her parents ditch her for a day, leaving her in the care of a neighbor. The girl will regress to the events that have hurt her.  \"Rabbits have been a symbol of childhood ever since Lewis Carroll's portray of a certain elusive character, but it is in the interpretation of each psyche that it takes a more perpetual shape. In my analysis of its symbolism, the rabbit expresses a female childhood at an age close to puberty, along with the desire to leave the bonds; perhaps a virginal consciousness that remains in the symbol of rabbits to this very day.\"  Laura Maria Isabel Ruiz Ocadiz.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/x7VjCBgpbwYhxssWDbTMytwGTV5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":169498,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pertúrpure Cinema","origin_country":""},{"id":169497,"logo_path":null,"name":"Luminosa Films","origin_country":""},{"id":169504,"logo_path":null,"name":"BabyFace Big Cast","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2021-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"How many times have you wished you could change your childhood?","title":"Misplace the rabbits","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
