A storm threatens to cause the river that runs through it to overflow again. A popular old belief claims that some women are predestined to disappear with each new flood, because they have the “water inside”. A band of young people is trying to overcome the weariness of a summer in the village that smells of death by smoking, dancing, and lusting after each other. In this electric atmosphere that precedes the storm, Ana and José live a love affair until the storm bursts.","popularity":7.701,"poster_path":"/kUdDRXx1EaJ299Zl2kTkVJGOhm0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109457,"logo_path":"/pYEbj8odvX8Yckezf2XZQuDuouj.png","name":"Suica Films","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":7395,"logo_path":"/cGOGYYfbJZ1uJHynRIf8yj4phRn.png","name":"Les films du Worso","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":182378,"logo_path":"/p0Gln1KFm9U7iGaERZ7gG5y2jU8.png","name":"Alina Film","origin_country":"CH"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2022-11-04","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Water","video":false,"vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":16}
