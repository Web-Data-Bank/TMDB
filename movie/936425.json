After checking into a beachside hotel, he finds himself in the crossfire of a volatile love triangle between two hotheads and the mysterious and elusive femme fatale Fabiola. The second feature by Juan Antonio Bisonó (Mosh) is a love letter to film noir both classic and contemporary - if the love letter in question was never sent because it got burned to a crisp by its dejected author - and a romantic comedy in reverse, where a breakup precedes the meet-cute, shaking up the beloved and her suitors like a spiked rum cocktail in the Santo Domingo sun.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cYZaI9pcaLTaOGpbLiwMFKR0G39.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":169561,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Felicidad","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Safari","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
