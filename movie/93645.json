Conventional science claims this is impossible, yet generations of inventors have been mesmerized by the promise of an engine that powers itself.  The worldâ€™s reliance on diminishing fossil fuel resources and the associated problems of pollution serve to spur them on.  A Machine to Die For showcases a number of dedicated, sometimes eccentric, and always obsessive individuals who have devoted their lives to this quest.  The documentary could be used as a resource when studying motion and simple machines in secondary science and physics.  It could also serve as a springboard for discussions about inventors and inventions and the history of scientific endeavors.
