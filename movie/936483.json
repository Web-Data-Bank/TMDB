Through this fundamental inquiry: ¿Qué es para usted la poesía? / What is poetry to you?, Vicuña unravels the role and substance of poetry in people’s lives. Speaking with school children, street performers, policemen, sex workers, fellow artists, and a scientist, the all embracing character of poetry emerges—its transformative role in personal relations, as a basis of oral history and the revolutionary imagination. – Chris Borkowski","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lvJaiDSDqhEfaSVyIxmVEV5XgI3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What Is Poetry to You?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
