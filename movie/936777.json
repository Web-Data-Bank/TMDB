Perhaps it's the land itself that gives creative inspiration to all born there and to those who come to stay. Perhaps it's something even more intrinsic in the culture that's gives rise to this remarkable gift. The spirit of the place is such that the people express a tremendous joy of living and creating, and are always on a quest for music and entertainment. \"Where's the Craic?\" explores this remarkable culture, and why a town of 20,000 people has many more live music pubs than anywhere else in Ireland.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/skr1i2ftlH3SMCTRKAOCI5CttAJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":169617,"logo_path":null,"name":"Disclaimer Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Where's the Craic?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
