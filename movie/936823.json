Following this motto, dance teacher Alan Brooks shows 25 vocational school students what they are capable of, and how they can master life with more confidence as a result. WE ARE GOOD is a gripping account of the fascination of dance, faith in oneself and others, enthusiasm, dedication, respect and lust for life - the dream of a tolerant and diverse community. The film not only spotlights dance and music but also existent social role models and shows how we can emancipate ourselves from them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/eHtSLFlYHCEwccaVZFgp7SiJGql.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2091,"logo_path":"/bUomMJoEX2W7XpgvNeWswCFKzrW.png","name":"Hochschule für Fernsehen und Film München","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Are Good","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
