In the early 60s, she astonished the nascent beat scene at Toronto's Bohemian Embassy with her exotic looks and her accomplished writing style. During her lifetime MacEwen travelled to Greece and Egpyt, married twice, wrote novels, translated Greek verse, took lovers and wrote radio scripts. Above all, she wrote luminous poetry, some of which is sensitively visualized in this thoughtful, pensive work which features insights from Margaret Atwood, Judith Merrill and Rosemary Sullivan.\"  -- Hot Docs Canadian International Documentary Festival","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xaa8HzgK0IQvs5fcWnT0BgGC7Ps.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1999-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shadow Maker: Gwendolyn MacEwen, Poet","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
