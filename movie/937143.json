He leaves in a huff. The minister tells them that his daughter will be on hand next Sunday and will play for them. Mary arrives. She is introduced to the quartette who, during the week days, sow seeds and plow. The minister is writing a sermon when the deacon enters and demands the payment of the mortgage on the church. He is insistent, but promises to wait upon meeting Mary, when his heart melts at the sight of her loveliness.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fsNGDWp77bTlDY3Q2vEqjDh7aIp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":22307,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nestor Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Village Choir","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
