My focus is their skinny legs, knobby knees, and wide flat feet (plus their cheeky fearlessness). Music is by contemporary composer Lois V. Vierk, whose work is influenced by Japanese gagaku court music. Gulls, layered glissandi, and crosscut editing between multiple frames interplay in counterpoint, and with ironic, tongue-in-cheek, formality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trio en Rose","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
