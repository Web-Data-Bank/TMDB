The comical dimension is at least as entertaining as the skating and with parts from guys like Charles Rivard or Antoine Asselin, that says a lot. Just like in their previous videos, Dime Turd Season transports you to the grimy streets Montreal with its crackheads and street fights, whilst staying loyal to their trademark recurring images and their unpredictable soundtracks.  It just goes to show that the best skate videos come from the guys who don’t take themselves too seriously, no matter how talented they are.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fr2rDafll7WZxYvGcWL1Xemh4UW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Turd Season","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
