But if there is one constant since the beginning of this crisis, it is the hope displayed by our leaders that vaccines will save us. Unfortunately, and even if these cases seem rare, these vaccines sometimes cause serious, even fatal side effects. In this worldwide race, and particularly in France, towards the vaccination of the entire population, are these victims properly taken care of medically? Are they well taken into account? Have the right measures been taken to prevent these vaccine accidents from happening again? This is what this film tries to answer, by giving the floor to victims and specialists on the subject.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vutpZzVXR0QLO7TaFJQRIkPjVxn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Effets secondaires: la face cachée des vaccins","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
