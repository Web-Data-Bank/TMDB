She is visited by a friend who suggests that they go to a matinee. They do so and Mrs. Barr discovers Mr. Barr in a box with the other woman. She leaves very much broken up. She attempts suicide on a railroad track, but is frightened by the rumbling of the train. She next visits a drug store where her nervous manner gives away her intention to the druggist.
