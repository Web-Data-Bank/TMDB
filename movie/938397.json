Her five roommates are even less honestly employed. One of them, Elsie Brown commits suicide because her main squeeze, Frank Norwood has left her. Elsie's small town mother comes to the city and meets Elsie's roommates. But Mother Brown's faith and purity are so compelling that the ladies of the night reform. Grace, in fact, gives up her affair with a married man -- even though she really loves him -- to go live with Mrs. Brown in the country.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rtVMZCI1XBt3CgxzsnOXGXwokJc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48145,"logo_path":null,"name":"J.
