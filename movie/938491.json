Reckless and troublesome, Ha Kyung has a tough time taking care of her and is sensitive enough as it is but she finds out that the groom is no other than the man she divorced five years ago, Seo In Jae.  In Jae suggests she puts someone else in charge of the project but she rejects the idea. This project will decide the position of branch manager for her and she couldn't risk it.
