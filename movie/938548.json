Fearlessly outspoken in life and in her work, Atwood has always been an unrelenting provocateur. Now at the age of 77, her star shines brighter and bolder than ever with an explosive television adaptation of her best-known work The Handmaid's Tale, which was first published in 1985. It is a dystopian work of speculative fiction set in the future, which has drawn comparison with aspects of Donald Trump's leadership, in particular the charges of misogyny which have inflamed anti-Trump campaigners across America. Alan Yentob meets Margaret Atwood in Toronto and discovers how a childhood spent between the Canadian wilderness and the city helped shape her vision of herself and the world, set alight her imagination and set her forth on a path to literary success.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7RJ9YmrEYXsliuAteerFQnrYBvI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-08-28","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Margaret Atwood: You Have Been Warned","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
