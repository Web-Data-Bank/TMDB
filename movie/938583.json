On this occasion Alan said: Whenever I have the opportunity to play with a Symphony Orchestra, I always try to put into the setlist songs that we otherwise would not be able to perform live, such as the epic Silence and I from the album Eye In the Sky, for example. We also took this opportunity to play The Sorcerer's Apprentice from our latest studio album, The Secret. It is a new version of a well-known classic song written by the Frenchman Paul Dukas which originally appeared in the film Fantasia.","popularity":0.661,"poster_path":"/hczEjBTylGtZq28LBpFPEtOVaf9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-02-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alan Parsons - One Note Symphony, Live in Tel Aviv","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
