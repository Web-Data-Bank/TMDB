In a gingham gown and bare feet she roams the mountain sides as care-free as the birds which carol in the pine trees above her. Creeping along the mountain trail one morning she overhears two men discussing a land deal in which her father has been concerned. To her dismay she learns that her father has disposed of a valuable piece of land underneath which are rich coal veins. Realizing that her father has been duped, the girl is about to shoot the man who has bought the property, when his kindly face restrains her.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":40536,"logo_path":null,"name":"Victor Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-12-19","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Heart of the Hills","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
