For the first time ever, nearly half the players, including the captain, are Muslim. This documentary explores the challenges that the Muslim players face from media critics and fans as well as how the team perseveres because of their passion for the game. Israeli director Shuki Guzik notes, “If an Arab child sees a Muslim score a goal for the Israeli team made of Arab and Israeli players, I see only good can come out of this.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":169945,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kastina Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2020-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Common Goal","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
