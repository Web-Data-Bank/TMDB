This performance version further animates the newspaper text by using intermittent projection, pausing and re-starting the film on its way through the projector. The pauses allow us to read chance fragments of the newspaper.  In performing the work two identical prints are shown superimposed with a slight difference in image size, which varies throughout the performance. The projectionists attempt to bring the two films into synchronisation with each other by alternately freezing and running the films. During these brief periods of synchronisation something unexpected happens as a result of the slight misregistration of the two identical images and of their accompanying sounds.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Newsprint #2","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
