Both cross the city from head to toe in search of redemption, liberation or perhaps a place to hide. To find it they will go as far as the sea, as far as the body of a young prostitute, but they will find it, perhaps, only in the feeling that brings them together and binds them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qmziSzxwdMlgzTICb3nwSLBaoIX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15902,"logo_path":null,"name":"CSC","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dentro Roma","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
