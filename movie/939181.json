Such places concretize dreams and consequences of queer-dom in the 20th century and beyond (see Pulse slaughter, 2016). Stonewall itself is modeled here based on first person accounts of the iconic bar, where against the full-moon early morning hours of June 28, 1969, queers raged against oppression. They threw pennies, bricks, beer bottles, a trash-can, and a parking meter. In the video they, we, and those tools of rebellion dance, affirming that past, present & future, celebration and protest, are not mutually exclusive.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wzQNjcncToM1lVn0PH1mCG1VIkL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2016-10-23","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It's Stonewall in My Navel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
