A year later, I returned for a few months and took the ferry out to see Ms. Liberty close up for the first time. On the ferry I recorded the voices of some of my fellow passengers saying ‘Statue of Liberty.’ I spent the next month recording many more people saying the words in a wondrous variety of accents and languages. I was moved by the delight and pleasure that people took in uttering these magical words: words suggesting freedom and hope for millions of immigrants” (Joel Singer).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4vZJ3rlKot634v05YixYct378Gr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Liberty","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
