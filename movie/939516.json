The film travels through interconnecting streams of memory, exploring the balance between the industrial, electrical whirrings and waste cycles of our consumer-driven modern world, alongside the more essential pulses, textures and rhythms of nature. From cityscapes to tiny bugs, in discord and harmony; we navigate through the residual static left somewhere in-between.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/q8NkASQ2jm9zX2VOca3VahD9a9c.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":170014,"logo_path":null,"name":"Little Microcosms","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"},{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"},{"iso_3166_1":"MY","name":"Malaysia"},{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-02-27","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A patchwork of images exploring the balance between the electrical whirrings and waste cycles of our consumer-driven modern world, alongside the essential pulses, textures and rhythms of nature.","title":"Empty Feet & Fireflies","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
