Through an initiative, this territory of rich biodiversity and geodiversity, of unique morphological processes, aspires to be recognized as a UNESCO Global Geopark. The region is house of \"No Alto Maipo\", a social and environmental movement, that tried to stop the construction of the Alto Maipo Hydropower Plant since 2007. Owned by the US-American company AES Gener S.A., the construction was completed in 2021 with 74 km of tunnels to divert the riverbed and generate energy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hA7LaYplj0chaN7pGQ4fF4qcfrk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-02-16","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"MAIPO","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
