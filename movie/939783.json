His days are grey and almost identical. Taking care of his small son has become passive pandering to a capricious child. But Oleg leads a double life — he is hooked on stimulants, an interest he shares with his mistress. He buys the drugs through the Darknet and regularly picks up the stashes. The story follows him on another quest for synthetic emotions, but this time Oleg has no idea what’s coming for him.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mDoISUz1xaQMEA2vDcc9MpB4ji4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10694,"logo_path":"/vKBor8qoX7Z6zhd7gmn4ADHO245.png","name":"MetraFilms","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Last Quest","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
