The narrative follows Ting-hao as he reflects on how his political idealism fits in with everyday political reality and ponders Taiwan’s complex political landscape, Taiwan’s relations with a meddlesome yet surprisingly indifferent China, and the perspectives of Matsu residents on Taiwan-China affairs.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1HBFdM8GSLUsUCfOVmWBmzaeZzu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2022-05-07","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Islands","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
