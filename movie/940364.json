It is Christmas Eve. He takes his revolver and starts out in quest of gain. Dot gets home, tired out and distressed because she has been discharged from the store. Her crippled sister hangs up her stocking and prays for the morrow. It is too much for Dot. She goes out to secure money for a present at any cost. Passing the window of a mansion, she observes a man give a woman a necklace. In the hurried departure, it is left behind. The temptation is too strong: she gets through the window and secures the necklace, only to be confronted by the cracksman, who has entered another way and pretends to be the owner. She tells her sad tale.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":56014,"logo_path":null,"name":"Powers Picture Plays","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-12-19","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Cracksman Santa Claus","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
