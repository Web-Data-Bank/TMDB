The documentary dramatizations are dedicated to the paradoxical periods of the protagonist's life: his leadership in a rebel unit, participation in the civil war of the early 1920s, his hiding from persecution under the guise of a Soviet police officer, his job as a factory construction worker. The stories about situations in the past are reproduced using the actions of contemporary characters: contemporary anarchists, officers of the New Police, students and workers. The filming took place at the locations of particular historical events, in Poltava, Hadiach, Kharkiv and Bohodukhiv.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tMudCOkAs5OF48rI9ekoIrgRYId.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2016-12-24","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grey Horses","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
