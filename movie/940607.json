He had no purpose in life until he watched the Pencetus Ummah promo. Since then, Ahmad has cultivated the ambition to participate in the dakwah program to become Abang Beduk. So from there is a rather funny scene from Ahmad.  From there though he was unsuccessful, but at least there was also an initiative to get better.
