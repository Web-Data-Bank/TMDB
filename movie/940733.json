They thought they were on their way to freedom when they leapt into a balloon and took to the skies, but upon landing on an island where nothing is as it seems, these escapees are about to embark on the adventure of a lifetime. From bloodthirsty beasts to murderous pirates and a mad genius named Captain Nemo (Patrick Stewart), treachery lurks behind every corner on this island, and if these five survivors have any hope of staying alive, they'll have to fight to their dying breaths to escape the island and get back to the modern world.","popularity":1.075,"poster_path":"/v2WG8MqwVVofM281kZaZkL6kofF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-09-17","revenue":0,"runtime":172,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The tale is legendary.
