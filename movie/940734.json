Someone wants to join in and play but isn't allowed. Someone is crying and someone is teasing. Someone is finally called a friend. Wanted to be Friends is a film that is completely on the children's side. With a camera that is consistently on level with the children, it immediately feels like being six years old again - with all the big emotional fluctuations that entails.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oAk1uo9nSWtmWLPY5BvicF0xQNJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":14803,"logo_path":null,"name":"Story AB","origin_country":"SE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2009-01-24","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Scenes from a youth centre","title":"Wanted to be Friends","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
