It has been weaponized in the media, radicalized, and apparently caused polarization between generations. However, these few loud opinions do not make up the whole. In this film, we take a closer look at the evolution of feminism through the generations, reveling a surprising similarity. Are we really different in our ideas of feminism, or is this just a perception? In addition, with Generation Z on track to being â€œmost diverse, best-educated generation yet,\" as well as having access to smart phones since birth, there is no question that they will impact the movement. This film is a culmination of a year long research study to determine the future of feminism. Welcome to the fifth wave.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gMzfOY2mLeHlmxltrIKgmR07uJ7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Feminism: The Fifth Wave","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
