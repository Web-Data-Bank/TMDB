I don't mind if it's an imitation of Godard. The film begins with the words \"I don't care if it's an imitation of Godard\", and then a series of images that seem to imitate some film appear and disappear one after another. The film is interrupted by a sceptical narration, which pauses to describe the artist's anguish at not knowing how to end the film, even though he wants to. A light, self-assertive film that pretends to be a film imitation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/499yChvJn2YtKGBWhs5ulsj75k8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"END, END","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
