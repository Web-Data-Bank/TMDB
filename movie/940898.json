He is lynched by his editor, surprised by a zookeeper that a tiger has escaped, abused by a literary girl, and finally attacked by a real tiger. This ridiculous and tragic story is made into a unique comedy of the absurd through a combination of extremely deformed acting and imaginative visuals, far from realism. In particular, the powerful cutting of the same subject over and over again, from different angles and in different sizes, creates a unique expression, which, combined with the excellent locations, results in a wonderfully calculated fictional space. The use of music is also full of contemporary sensibility, and the combination of music and the scene at the industrial complex is superb.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jZHcVl9qpOZW9ZvtriuZYuNMxX4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Terrible Tiger","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
