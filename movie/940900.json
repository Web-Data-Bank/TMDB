Our heroes, the four Voice Rangers, rise up to the occasion in this near-future science fiction action romp that is sure to be a favorite among boys. The four heroes, the Voice Rangers, rise to the occasion. The four men shoot guns, chase and confront Kolo (the dog) in the high school and the surrounding residential area. Their exploits are portrayed in a dynamic and ridiculous way, with parodies of TV shows, clones of famous scenes from American films and MTV flicks. This is a film that is 10 years ahead of its time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/97b9Ip3lReVOBNRkpBx98kLgOwK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1986-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"COROMADA II","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
