She sets off on a trip to the Sea of Japan to find the truth, but her souvenirs are rather dull, including a rather rude female friend. This time she takes her younger brother Harumi with her to her home town. Together with Sawada, a classmate of Harumi's and a close friend of Miwa's, the three of them spend a summer holiday that takes them back to their childhood. However, when Miwa takes a picture of the place where her house used to be, when she plays pranks at the swimming pool, or when she catches a cold and falls asleep, she thinks about her father who suddenly disappeared one day.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/10MEHvCphgirF2Dkcu2dRCtDGUk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I DON'T TALK MUCH","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
