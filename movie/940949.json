A salesman and a maniac who plans to kill indiscriminately. The film is a microcosm of \"life\" in which four strangers, who have nothing to do with each other in the first place, end up in one house, struggling with instinct, greed, madness and sheer luck. It's a theme that could easily be found in a TV drama. This is a black comedy in which you can enjoy the characters of the actors.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gm1SB3UWOiEqTKw7HNCPWovcSEV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Life","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
