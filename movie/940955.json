However, as the scene progresses, the relationship between each of them begins to emerge, and eventually, the five are connected by a single thread. This is a typical relationship between a man and a woman, or a woman and a woman, but the sharp images accurately capture the emptiness of the relationship. The line in the film, \"I'm all alone\", is unforgettable.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/miwQE4u0DorkMSv3TnAJYAol7BA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Cold Sunday","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
