The film unfolds in a gentle rhythm of independent episodes, such as his interactions with his friends over compulsory reports and job-hunting activities, the beautiful young man he is interested in for some reason, and a visit from his sister. In addition, by placing the characters in the distance, the surrounding space is incorporated into the picture, and the freshness characteristic of early summer is expressed in a natural way. In combination with the unusual character of the protagonist, Sabu, the film depicts his \"uneventful\" daily life in an unhurried manner, and it is a strange work that draws the viewer in.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4fCzDtFhawIF6xk9PqOkf6tLuVp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":33,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Early Summer in 1989","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
