The man who closes it refuses conventional communication with a strong desire for self-expression, and throws and scatters his lost \"self\" all over the place, regardless of who he is or where he is. The camera becomes a part of the artist, crawls on the ground with him, and starts to rotate with him. Self-deprecating, voyeuristic, violent... A vivid depiction of the sick soul of modern youth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uHPnWqeZu8CtvC6svvCThJ9MyQc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":76,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Self-Closed Man","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
