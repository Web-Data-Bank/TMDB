The story of Yumiko, who comes from Wakayama on a school trip to Tokyo, also revolves around this symbol. Yumiko is 17 years old and in love with a classmate. Three years later, Yumiko's love blooms again in this city at the age of 20... This is a movie \"by girls for girls\", with the sharp point of view of a female director, which exposes the cuteness and ugliness of women through the simple, pure and honest protagonist, without any pretence. Yumiko runs around the screen in a cheerful yellow voice, explaining the subtle psychology of a girl in love.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ws2Iy84a5E7CEFUGCoo2HNJrGaz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Under the Erotic Tokyo Tower","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
