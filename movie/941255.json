Recently has been in a slump and his writing has been slow. His editor, Kyoko, worries that he is just dazed, watching videos sent to him by friends on their travels. Then Akira's cousin, Yoiko, comes to visit him. She refuses to go back to her family, but Akira decides to keep her with him for a while. There are many sad and tender scenes, and the scenery with Akira, who can't write, and Yoiko, who stutters, has a very poetic sound and aftertaste as the title suggests. The final scene is so vivid that you can't help saying \"I've been hit! It is so vivid that you want to say \"I've been hit!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p3Xz3wJei8lsX7x9qXeNvMnBigE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":170254,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nagoya University Film Study Group","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Children's Book","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
