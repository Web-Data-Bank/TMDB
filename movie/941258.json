Shoutaro's best friend, Yosuke, and his girlfriend, Kyoko, are at a loss as to what to do. The film is a fresh take on an ordinary scene in Tokyo. The fuzzy pain of a man and a woman who have lost their best friend and their lover is expressed in a refreshing and poignant way. The director's skill in giving life to the bicycle as a prop and letting it tell the story of Shotaro's existence and the delicate relationship between Kyoko and Yosuke shines through.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/b1yiKAYntMZxqJ3XvrmWlow4vp5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":63,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Come Over by bicycle","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
