They have never seen each other since Noboru broke up with her because of his infidelity, but after a dispute over a debt, they decide to meet again for the first time in six months. As they spend the night alone, their intentions become intertwined, and the subtle interplay of truth and lies in their conversations reveals more and more of the unrequited feelings of their former lovers... In this vivid romantic drama, the psychology of a man and a woman who have parted ways, but in their hearts have not yet become strangers, is portrayed more realistically than in reality, using documentary techniques. In the latter half of the film, the conflict between the two men's hearts is clearly revealed through their conversations alone, and the film is brilliantly directed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5FrNZ2qtRm4PxH1xrUHkrRPnik5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":51,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Ex-Lover and I","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
