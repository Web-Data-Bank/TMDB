Although she is no longer a child, she feels an irresistible sense of loneliness when she realises that her former boyfriends and friends have started to go their own ways. But this is her night alone. The light of the moon and the vision of her mother surround her gently as she weeps.  The film looks at a woman, but without a story, carefully capturing the inner world of a girl with dense and beautiful images. The title \"Lacrime\" is Latin for \"tears\".","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gEbietnCl2qteIhN2kCXwWex1iu.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lacrime","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
