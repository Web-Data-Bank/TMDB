They crack down on illegal parking relentlessly, and because of their appearance, they are called “Euglena,” green tiny organism. Makoto, a straight arrow, strictly clamps down all the unlawful parking cars, but Shige, a loose cannon, pardons girls who park illegally. These two people receive a business request at a downtown area in the middle of the night because they’ll get more money than doing in the daytime. However, night-time working becomes totally different then usual.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/icJ34SP7KNGAnbga9Ggl9Zd9KgA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2019-11-16","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dream of Euglena","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
