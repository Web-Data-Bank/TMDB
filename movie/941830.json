She forged her own path and to that end became a single parent, eventually adopting and raising four children.  Like many parents, she picked up a 16mm camera and began filming both the special and the ordinary events of her family’s life. These home movies (ca. 1940–42) present that which one rarely gets to see: a larger-than-life personality at home, unadorned, just being herself—and often in color, at a time when her feature films were black and white. Crawford filmed most of the home movies herself; when she is on camera, it is unclear who is behind it.","popularity":0.841,"poster_path":"/e2MBdq8AlBBnUp574mi17oN2F0Y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1942-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Joan Crawford's Home Movies","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
