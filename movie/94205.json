According to the guidelines, the data were immediately isolated and sent to be re-evaluated in order to classify the registered events and to develop further options for protective and preventive efforts. A few days later, the tranquility of the sleeping \"Xonasu\" was torn apart by sharp, blazing fragments of multiple meteors. The area around the \"Xonasu\" faltered - a wave of interruptions and failures rapidly swept through the heart of its systems ... and one of the errors launched the sequence to awake the Supreme Operator of Xonasu. A little later - all was quiet and still.","popularity":1.784,"poster_path":"/wReCMn22d2vuKur5zq0vN0ySsVq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-12-22","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Exaella","video":false,"vote_average":5.1,"vote_count":5}
