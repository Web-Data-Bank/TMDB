When I see the recorded videos during my childhood, I feel a sense of alienation as if I was looking into the past of others. These videos cut our memories into pieces and pieces, are they recorded as fact, or memorized as the truth? Thinking about the gap between fragmented memories and actual records, the deconstructed images are arranged in a way that compensates for the negative sides that have not been recorded. Those blurred images and inarticulate voices might be seen as an expression of the discrepancy of my memories.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zEYDsM681mCgoYwZn60qE09RMou.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-07-05","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"home, sweet home","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
