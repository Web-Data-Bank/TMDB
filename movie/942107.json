Three Filipino warriors fought against the oppression of the Spanish regime in the late 19th century. They come from different backgrounds- a man from a line of chieftains conquered centuries ago; a woman with the conquerorâ€™s blood in her veins rejected by her family of privilege; and a young man from a land across the sea fighting for his new home. Now the three find themselves in a new time. A time where the Philippines is a free nation. A time when the Philippines is as enslaved as ever. Their eyes have seen oppression. They still see it and they act in the only way they can. They fight.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8blqprI2ugMAvmsJW9C7PyFrkxV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"release_date":"2015-05-28","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Tagalog","iso_639_1":"tl","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lakas ng Lahi","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
