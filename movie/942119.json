Goes to advanced training courses. At lectures, considering this occupation very pointless, together with colleagues, he enters into a controversy with a famous professor who has been studying the human brain all his life. The man emotionally makes it clear to the women present that their behavior is very justified, since the human brain, in fact, always resists its own work, fulfilling its main natural purpose – to transmit the genome to the next generation. And modern society, trying to make people out of us, is only rushing against nature itself. Svetlana's personal life is not particularly developing. She's married. There are no children. Emotional and domestic disorder forces her to have a relationship on the side. What will she do at the most critical moment of her life and what will be her future fate, will it be the choice of her own mind or will nature put everything in its place?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iZB3uXs7MSLAnVwnExch8wFWrkR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-01-16","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dizziness","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
