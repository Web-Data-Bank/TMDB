It's a shot of the girl he loves with another man. The young man has been dumped! He bites his lip and remembers those glorious days of love. And now, in order to express his anger, his frustration, his sadness and his regret, he comes up behind them...  The word for \"lost love\" is \"persistent\". The story is about the youthfulness and innocence of a man who has lost his persistence. The frustration of youthful immaturity. The uncool and shameful part of the male sex, and the love for it. The melancholy and unhurried narrative suddenly comes to an unexpected end, and the audience realises that this is a very short and hilarious coming-of-age graffiti.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/t5FacleJvnYuCTsmMLxa16UegBa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lost Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
