He won four Academy Awards for his film scores, he composes concertos, musicals and operas. He conducts, arranges music, and is a renowned pianist, as well as a jazz musician. Previn’s first opera, ‚A Streetcar Named Desire’, based on Tennessee Williams’ play, successfully premiered in San Francisco, in 1998.  Our film mirrors Sir Previn’s affinities to Europe as well as to the United States. He is at home in both worlds, with their rather different cultural realities.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kmt6HGtk10QaCMogcDdooXFqSZ6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":608,"logo_path":"/dD2Do4GHXAql5c4LjXCbEOvxbFg.png","name":"Dor Film Production Company","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-03-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"André Previn - A Bridge between two Worlds","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
