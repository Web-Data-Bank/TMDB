Whether you're feuding or fighting, you still make everything alright. That's where the Garrett family stands. Battling life's obstacles and raising children on an average pay schedule will make you become stressed, loaded with agony, balled up with hatred and devious ways, and you lose hope sometimes, but with family by your side you have weight of the world lifted off of you.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/v6jSPlNDtORddASFxQPovitVGp9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":170436,"logo_path":null,"name":"LBN TV NETWORKS","origin_country":""},{"id":170437,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mark Banks Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-01-30","revenue":15000,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A Middle Class Family Journey","title":"Family Still Matters","video":true,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":2}
