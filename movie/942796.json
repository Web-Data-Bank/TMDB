Long ago the fish had transformed into humans and came onto land to celebrate and dance. Once the sun had set, they hurried back into the sea, leaving behind a big mess. Curious as to who had been occupying the village in their absence, the villagers of one island plan to find out who those uninvited visitors were. What they would soon discover, leaves them amazed and mesmerized.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/scOL4yiZU8WHwAQkdXeSH902bNN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PG","name":"Papua New Guinea"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2022-02-25","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Idodo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
