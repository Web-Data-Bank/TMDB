Are we the only intelligent life, or is something else lurking out there?  For 60 years now, we have probed the skies for signs of alien intelligence, longing for connection -- to no avail. But new ideas and technologies are beginning to change the game.  Proudly presenting the third chapter in the Life Beyond trilogy: In Search of Giants.  In this journey, we will see how far weâ€™ve come in the search for intelligent life, how they might be communicating, just how advanced they might be, and what it would mean if we really did make contact.  It might take thousands of years to make a discovery. But as long as the mystery endures, the search for giants will continue. It's in our blood to want to know.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yf8p2U7GKo7rMNb5SNI9IdbRikN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-12-07","revenue":0,"runtime":43,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Life Beyond III: In Search of Giants","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":3}
