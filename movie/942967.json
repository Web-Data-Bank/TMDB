This is the voiceover over Kazuko's crying figure in the meadow. The voice is that of Haruko, Kazuko's best friend who is in a sanatorium. When Kazuko went to visit her, she was told to \"imagine\" her wrapped in a flower. On her way home, when she is followed in the forest by her classmate Yamada-Kun, Kazuko sees herself wrapped in a flower this time, while climbing a tree branch. With these strange thoughts in her mind, Kazuko arrives in a strange town. She smokes in an incinerator with her new friends and falls in love with the place. One day, on a bicycle trip, she discovers that the sanatorium she had missed is no longer there. There is only a vacant lot. Kazuko crouched there and wept.  It was the seventh day after Haruko's death.  The transience of memory and the sadness of forgetting. A fantasy of flowers and greenery, with a touch of fantasy that visualises the sadness of fading memories.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oAWprVifYg9ZppMGu4eVNpilJeL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"煙之花　花之煙","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
