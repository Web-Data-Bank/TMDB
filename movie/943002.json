The next day, Ando goes to visit him. The next day, he is told by a visiting detective that Arai has committed suicide. From that day on, the supposedly dead Arai begins to disrupt Ando's life.  In a series of well-crafted episodes, Ando shows us the two things that ordinary people fear the most: \"being a bit strange\" and \"being rumoured to be a bit strange\". However, the film's humour, which is on the edge of psycho, such as Arai's vivacity after his death, leaves a strange taste that straddles the line between funny and scary.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/aaxuW1VpXcVwA8NUkbhmwYkyc3h.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ストレンジ・ハイ","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
