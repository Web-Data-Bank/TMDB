Then one day, their new house, which the couple had painstakingly built together, catches fire due to Yuka's carelessness. Fortunately, no one in the family is seriously injured and Yasushi is relieved, but the shock of the fire causes Yuka to suffer from a neurological disorder called dissociative amnesia, and she is unable to remember even her own name.
