One day, Riho, the girl he thought he had broken up with, comes back with a withered sunflower flower. Yuji is confused, but he accepts her, but Riho and her friends have no memory of their breakup. However, not only Riho, but also his friends have no memory of their break-up, and events like déjà vu begin to occur around Yuji. When Yuji realises the truth, the sunflowers are in full bloom.  This light comedy depicts the steps of the protagonist as he climbs the next step in his love life by redoing \"the love he wanted to cherish more\", in the flow of time from the present to past to present. The director's sense and playfulness can be felt in the supporting characters, including the protagonist's beloved car, which does not listen to him easily.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tx11HqQ1U5mp6sLS8mBtWpDTYOv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ひまわりのテーマ","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
