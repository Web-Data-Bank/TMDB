One night, Maki, a psychology major at university, meets a girl crouched by a guardrail. One night, Maki, a psychology student at university, meets a girl crouched beside a guardrail who tells him she hears the sound of the guardrail. However, when her friend comes to check on her after hearing Maki's story, he does not see the girl. When the girl regains her memory, Maki begins to understand who she really is...  By interweaving a sound story and an episode of psychoanalysis, the film succeeds in turning a love story with a ghost into a serious psychic fantasy. The fragility of Kyoko Akiyama as the ghost makes the film even more compelling.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vyl58MygQT415rFtisN1ld1pFEA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ガードレール","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
