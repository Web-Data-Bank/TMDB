A young salaryman is fed up with the mundane but secure life he leads and goes AWOL from work. On a whim, he calls Noriko, a woman he once played with, and goes to take care of her in bed with a cold. Noriko is cheerful and innocent, and he begins to tell her about his daily frustrations and his dissatisfaction with society, which he has not even told his wife...  Director Sugiura has put a lot of effort into creating appealing characters in this film. The film uses elaborate dialogue and UFO catchers to portray the sense of discomfort that most people today feel at one time or another, that even if they have no clear grievances, they will be taken in by society and become boring salarymen.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3zOAX18gduBnbpP4x17kLaqXsPB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"萎れかけた春のために","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
