There is a man who was sexually violated as a child. He is troubled by the presence of another self, who appears before his eyes and reminds him of that time. The man hates the boy, but not completely, as he tries to control him by force but cannot. The boy silently adores the man. In the end, the two decide to live together in a world that is always looking for curiosity.  The psychological symbols hidden here and there are not only rhetorical but also beautiful and striking enough as visuals to give a sense of sadness born of inevitability. The fact that the faces of the people are not shown clearly gives the film the effect of a scene from a dream.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nfoWR4L9hOdeLikOOFgmLnzmcvo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rehabilitation","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
