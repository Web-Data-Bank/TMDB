Sunao is a boy who understands that there is no right thing or right person in the world, but he is obsessed with the fact that there are too many wrong things and wrong people in the world. In the closed room of the train, a microcosm of the world, are the scenes Sunao encounters a mirage or reality? Is the other boy who follows him an illusion created by Sunao, or is he an alter ego of the world?  This is an instantaneous spatial film that expresses through a boy with an inner weakness the fantasy that everyone has of being able to hit a noisy woman or a pompous man who happens to be in the same carriage as him. The filming on the train, which must have been done guerrilla style, makes us feel the speed at which the train runs.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8g5Wl5yYq664Rif4RpLQzjpksWv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1993-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"列車ノトビラゴシニメヲアわせるヒト人へ","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
