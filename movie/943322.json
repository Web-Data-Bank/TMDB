Although down and out, Ko takes in Siu-fung (Yung Siu-yi), an unwilling erotic dancer who has fled the war to Hong Kong. They may lead destitute lives, but their conscience remains intact. Director Cai Chusheng co-founded the National Salvation Association of Cinema. When Ko makes a uproar at the dance parlour and rips apart his friend's zombie costume, it represents Cai's criticism on the muddling-along attitude of Hong Kong society at the time. The characters' decision to return to the mainland to join the resistance effort also foretells Cai's decision to do the same in real-life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/viNjBOPJ3PgFyCZyrksoUEo84S0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":174197,"logo_path":null,"name":"Xinsheng Production Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1941-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":103,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ten Thousand Li Ahead","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
