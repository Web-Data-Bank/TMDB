What will disappear next?  The protagonist feels less and less alive every day. Even though she is a virgin, the only way she can think of to confirm her own life is to try a pregnancy test. To put an end to her boredom and pessimism, she leaves a message on her dial Q2 and meets a man. What does she get in exchange for making a man with a voice fetish cum?  Despite the stylish pictures with a French taste, the story deepens from ennui to horror. The first half of the film, \"the sense of alienation peculiar to a period when one is not young enough to be called a girl, but young enough to be called a woman\", becomes \"a scary story in the style of modern folklore\" at the end.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jw1aSwRakQCjFlDIwB4iIFCRIHv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"それでも夜明けは訪れて","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
