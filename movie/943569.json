Hailing from a simple family in the outskirts of Bengal, Paresh has big dreams of making it big in life in the Fil Industry. Talented, honest and very hard-working, Paresh filters through menial jobs and runs errands for several employers to make his luck work and achieve his dreams. The movie charts his struggle as a compositer at several press offices, the several crooks and sleaze-bags that he deals with and many ups and downs that life throws at him. He has a few faithful people in his life, like his wife, his employers Ela and Uncle, his elder brother and others who help him out and support and encourage him throughout. The movie ends on a happy note, where Paresh breaks his way through and releases his movies, with many more to come.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3sIXcfC1njTbB2LWx2ojsKNnzh5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2017-07-21","revenue":0,"runtime":150,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sunyo Theke Suru","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
