He has dedicated his life to exploring the Guyanese Creole culture, a counter-culture born of the deprivation of the basic rights of slaves from Africa, which has been enriched by Amerindian, European, Indian and Chinese influences... A man of transmission, he has tirelessly shared his knowledge of tales, proverbs, language, dances, carnival... In order to find its origins, he had to undertake a fascinating journey into the cultures of the whole world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/86l1WPHuIzLhGf6k708Oho5T5h9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maître Contout - Mémoire de la Guyane","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
