Our two main characters take us with them into the intimacy of \"real people\". We cross the roads of France with them, in their different vans and pick-up trucks transformed for the occasion into mini movie studios. Their concept: to film \"declarations of love\" and to deliver them directly by van to their recipients. And we discover, as we go along, that our duo and their own personal adventures are subtly intertwined with the people they film. This mix of genres offers several universes to the spectator in order to make him question himself about love.","popularity":0.645,"poster_path":"/A68dCrQMXdpWenyoVQHWoOElLuF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":165178,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fidelio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-06-15","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Je t'aime, filme-moi!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
