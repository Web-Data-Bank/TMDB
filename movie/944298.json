But Bergmann was more interested in the ant lion in the Lausitzer Sands than the lion in the African savannah. What began in the 1960s with fantastic animal observations using special technology soon became a representation of comprehensive ecological relationships and the search for solutions to environmental problems - no easy undertaking in the GDR. All this always with a fresh breeze of humor and playfulness in filmmaking.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gcDdUc0n2QSTTOaPZ6pHPZhROdk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Documentary film about the work of Siegfried Bergmann","title":"The Ways of an Animal Filmmaker","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
