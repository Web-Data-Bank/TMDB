Alex Lutz (recently seen as the son in Gaspar Noé’s Vortex) plays a man determined to escape with his elderly father (the ineffable André Dussollier) from a wildfire that is rapidly approaching their forested area of southern France. The pair know all the local roads, and the secret detours, but when they are caught in a dead end, they seem to be running out of possible exits. At once road movie, claustrophobic jeopardy thriller and portrait of a prickly but tender father-son relationship, this finely acted and executed film expertly lays on the heat.","popularity":2.079,"poster_path":"/phFNzjz4zifghYmCWwVWuWHqFEv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17653,"logo_path":"/ajdJNUuVI12xIgVzDMO6HY8NZzR.png","name":"22h22","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":112442,"logo_path":null,"name":"GapBusters","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":49755,"logo_path":"/iom7Z8e1dzoTfCvwq8F4bJvbeIJ.png","name":"Apollo Films","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":694,"logo_path":"/5LEHONGkZBIoWvp1ygHOF8iyi1M.png","name":"StudioCanal","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":8661,"logo_path":null,"name":"APC","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Blaze","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":3}
