When she arrived, she was greeted coldly, compelled to perform menial services, and treated more like a servant than a relation. Naturally, she was very unhappy. About this time the family was thrown into excitement by the news that the father's old chum in college, who had gone to Australia to make a fortune, had returned, with $1,000,000, and intended to marry and settle down. The parents figured that this was an excellent chance for their only child, and planned to marry her to the millionaire.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":35353,"logo_path":"/rVxiD2rIVla7S1liKIox42U6GkW.png","name":"Thanhouser Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1912-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Niagara Honeymoon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
