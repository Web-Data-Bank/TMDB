The film and the album are studies that consider slow shifts and personal changes experienced by the artist over the past several years. The film focuses on isolation and a gradual reflective turn inward as it attempts to navigate interior domestic landscapes, acknowledging the complexity of the inner realm, whose small transformations and movements can be as profound as macroscale developments in the outside world. – Christopher Bissonnette","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pgo91sgLk4wQRvs7WgQDc9kf8Dg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2022-02-08","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wayfinding","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
