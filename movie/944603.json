After \"Open Your Eyes\", \"Lords of The Boards\" and countless other hits, life was different for many teenagers than before, somehow what was wrong before became right. In 1997, the Guano Apes played the legendary Cologne E-Werk in Grund und Boden with irrepressible power, this DVD is nothing less than a contemporary document that shows where at that time the top of alternative rock was throughout Europe. Three number 1 albums and a few hits further,... 14 years later, the Guano Apes returned here in 2011, \"Bel Air\" was the name of the furious comeback. Everything was different and yet pleasantly familiar. They knew each other, and the Apes shook the Cologne E-Werk a second time.
