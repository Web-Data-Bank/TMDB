This already special day is made more unusual by the recent arrival of her grandson, Lev, who had immigrated to the United States with his family in 2001. Returning to Ukraine for the first time as an adult, Lev documents his grandmother as she tends to the small homestead and prepares for the birthday celebration in the rural village in Ukraine. By capturing moments of arduous labor, as well as through personal conversation, Lev inquires into his grandmothers relationship to her home, land - and their family.","popularity":1.105,"poster_path":"/t9GrlhNQ6ecjMspRH65DUXO6pAE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":170817,"logo_path":null,"name":"LEVOMEL Productions LLC","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-03-27","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lida","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
