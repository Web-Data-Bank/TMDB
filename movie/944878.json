Following his urge to communicate, the Major is looking for listeners and encouragement. He doesn't find either. Instead, the repeated monological memory of his own heroic deeds determines his present – with all the consequences.  This 30-minute short film is based on the statements made by the mercenary Siegfried Müller in the documentary “The Laughing Man” (Walter Heynowski and Gerhard Scheumann, DEFA studio for newsreels and documentaries, 1966), as well as records from the German colonial period in Africa.  An intensive contribution to the necessary public debate about the consequences of military operations.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sOMa9u9IPz4ShStuPUsfM8VZGUS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":170847,"logo_path":null,"name":"Übermut tut gut!","origin_country":""},{"id":170848,"logo_path":null,"name":"Digital Cinema Mastering","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2013-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"In Germany they call me \"Komü\", the Kongomüller","title":"Kongomüller","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
