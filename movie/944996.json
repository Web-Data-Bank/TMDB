A certain professor was bothered this way. He was not afraid of ghosts and could have endured one whose specialty was silent haunting. He found, however, that the weeping maiden was a nuisance, and prevented him from concentrating. So he decided, ungallant though his conduct might be deemed, to get rid of her.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/39zjNUmrm3ZYEH8SamL46UN0JSS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":35353,"logo_path":"/rVxiD2rIVla7S1liKIox42U6GkW.png","name":"Thanhouser Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1913-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When Ghost Meets Ghost","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
