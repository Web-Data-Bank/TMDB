The series will include all the quarantine songs and concerts, as well as various live shows from the past few years.  The first release, “Devolution Series #1 – Acoustically Inclined, Live in Leeds”, is a remixed and remastered version of the ‘Live in Leeds’ show that was originally included on the Empath Ultimate Edition as video asset. A cool acoustic show that deserves to be heard, now availble as audio version.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mylmfdBDhFOP0B74SmXpWOrMV5e.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"music","title":"Devin Townsend – Acoustically Inclined, Live In Leeds","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
