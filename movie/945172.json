The album is named \"UTAU\" because Onuki spins words to Sakamoto's songs and sings them. The two old acquaintances, who have shared musical activities and inspired each other, pursue their \"songs\" in the ultimate minimal space with only the two of them on stage, reminding us once again of the power of music and the beauty that songs possess.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ak06hXztiHJ1kQJYJJKd0cXRry4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":159141,"logo_path":null,"name":"Commmons","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2011-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":135,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Utau Live in Tokyo 2010 - A Project of Taeko Onuki & Ryuichi Sakamoto","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
