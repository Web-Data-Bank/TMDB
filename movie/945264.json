Ken is a university student who refuses to take anything seriously except picking up girls. Shin, a junior student who spends all his time picking up girls with Ken, has a girlfriend called Sakura for the first time. Shin worries about himself in terms of love. Shin gets angry at Ken's attitude of making fun of him, and they finally get into a fistfight. Ken loses out and gets injured, but still goes out into the night downtown to pick up girls again...  Conversation between Ken and Shin, who seem to be talking but do not communicate. Ken's pick-up, where he is actually not interested in the other person. Sakura, who doesn't explain anything. The bright emptiness of a generation living with language that does not produce communication is portrayed with a fixed camera like a photo box and night photography.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ynGfoSJotXlexYAzKaeJb0g8Z3v.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":168484,"logo_path":null,"name":"Waseda University Cine Lab Taco","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"JUDGE NOT","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
