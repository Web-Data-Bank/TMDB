A young man and woman live together. During the hot summer, the man is engaged in manual labour. The woman stays at home and sleeps. The only time she goes out is when she gets a phone call from the man who forgot his lunch. She takes her lunch to the construction site, waits until the work is finished and rides home on the back of her bicycle. The next day she sleeps again, and that's how she lives. One day, the woman wakes up comfortably. When she comes to, she finds an ice cube on her forehead. Her lipstick, which she had been unable to decide on no matter how much she applied, is now perfectly matched. She has a good feeling.  Getting up, getting dressed, walking along the dusty road, nibbling on ice cream... The film has a concise and powerful charm that flows throughout, symbolised by the movements of the main female character. After watching the film, you will feel that 'taking a nap is also a way of living straight'.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ow7fUrs2TaiP21tqiWrQOfVTaBA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"砂の涙","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
