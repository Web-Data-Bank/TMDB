Mahim marries her and they move to a village but she cannot forget Suresh. Her smouldering unhappiness takes the form of a resentment towards the orphaned Mrinal, raised by Mahim's father, and receives a dramatically visual embodiment when their house burns down. Mahim falls ill, is rescued by Suresh and nursed back to health by Achala. On a train (a metaphor for the irreversibly linear course of life) to a health-resort where Mahim is supposed to convalesce, Suresh on a rainswept night gives in to temptation and elopes with Achala. At the end of the film, there is a dubious reconciliation as Achala is shown following Mahim's 'good' traditionalism with Saratchandra's barely concealed hostility towards Achala's liberated Brhamo Samaj upbringing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9julv9osQgYQ0v9utDtW1yJaoUv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":94372,"logo_path":null,"name":"New Theatres Limited","origin_country":"IN"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"1936-11-20","revenue":0,"runtime":141,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Bengali","iso_639_1":"bn","name":"বাংলা"},{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grihadah","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
