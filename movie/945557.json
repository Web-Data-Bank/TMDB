The film uses only a few frames from the flipchart, turning day into night. Although the transition between every two frames is only four minutes, it may be long and unbearable for the audience. The characters hidden in the shadows can't wake up, the bicycle chains thrown over the field ridges have already stopped rotating, and the chimneys in the distance are still rising. Black smoke. The rain in front of the camera washed everything in vain, and the earth was fragrantâ€¦ Humanity and its civilization will eventually perish. This view means a lot to me personally. All the beautiful calligraphy, painting and music will be ruined, which is so awesome!
