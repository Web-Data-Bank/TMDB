The film follows the story of an Indian paraglider, Gurpreet Dhindsa and gazes upon this manâ€™s total commitment to flying and engages with the idea that adventure sports is closest to being most alive and we know that best when we come to injuries. Injuries are variable here, some are fears, most are obstacles and finally of-course the ones which are external, which reveal as the film unfolds. The challenge is to get better than our circumstances and that brings out the real one in us.  Gurpreet has given up things on earth to be in the skies.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nX5EKuFE2AhjpYVLpMugT0MyNO7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Once Upon a Sky","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
