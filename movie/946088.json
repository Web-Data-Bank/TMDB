Shot in Europe, AK, Canada, and the lower 48, Echo will be more of an experimental film compared to their last release, 'Stimulus'. The focus of this movie will be mainly on big-mountain riding and the experience of being a big-mountain rider. It also showcases four women riders in this flick: Jessica Sobolowski, Marte-Lise Karlsen, Laura Ogden, and Andrea Binning. Each will have an impressive section and a story to tell. Also featured will be newcomer Julian Carr, who front flips and back flips off cliffs from the range of 60 feet to 165feet. Joining him off the 165 footer is JT Holmes and Billy Poole. Heath Ordway will have the most well-rounded section with a 14 kink rail, backcountry jumps, and some impressive high speed doubles and other lines.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":171054,"logo_path":null,"name":"â€Ž Team Thirteen","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2005-08-16","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Echo.
