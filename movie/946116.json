Six young ​men walk ​into a forest in Taiwan, making close contact with ferns. They establish emotional and physical relationships with the plants, relying on their bodies rather than words. Ferns are very common in Taiwan​. They​ are valued by ​indigenous ​people but not by Japanese colonists​ or the Nationalists​.\r 2. A man makes love to a bird's nest fern​ and then starts eating it. Zheng reflects on our current moral outlook that it is “natural” to eat plants but “unnatural” to make love to them. Bird's nest fern is a popular delicacy in Taiwan.\r 3. Zheng collaborates with three local BDSM practitioners who in turn collaborate with three ​fern species​ to expand BDSM practice.\r 4. For centuries humans have been in love with furled fronds of young ferns. Inspired by Yaoi anime, this chapter follows a young couple in their acts of love with fiddleheads.\r 5. This chapter connects spores and sperms.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vs9B3PlAo53FlqRFe6ztfhtLD81.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":171056,"logo_path":null,"name":"TheCube Project Space","origin_country":""},{"id":171057,"logo_path":null,"name":"The 11th Taipei Biennial","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"2016-09-28","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pteridophilia","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
