Six young performers who belong to completely different styles - classical ballet, contemporary dance, krump, vogue, experimental hip-hop, pole dance - represent the new generation of Russian artists, free from preconceptions, clichés, and ready to be part of the dance revolution. The documentary format of the project looks at real people in an intimate setting and the behind-the-scenes routine of professional dancers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fG6urVxQYJHpjHzDpoYSIBOzOoz.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":102494,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio MAO","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2022-03-17","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Solo","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
