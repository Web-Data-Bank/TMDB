Prefaced by the Wittgenstein quotation included below, the image focuses on the vanishing point—aligning it with the top of the frame in wide shots—and movements of vehicles up and down the boulevard. While the film's first half presents a stationary shot, the second half follows individual cars and motorbikes, zooming in to frame them at a consistent size even as they advance toward and recede from the camera.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/caiEGs6SnQN8pvCOdjRPb5Oqom0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1975-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Recognition Construction IV: Recognition Construction in Film","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
