Civil conflict in the area prevented international experts from conducting a full and thorough investigation.  The wreckage should have been collected and scrupulously re-assembled to identify all the damage, but this standard investigative procedure was never carried out. Until thatâ€™s done, evidence can only be gleaned from pictures of the debris, the flight recorders or black boxes and eye-witnesses' testimonies.  This may be enough to help build a picture of what really happened to the aircraft, whether a rocket fired from the ground or gunfire from a military jet.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8flsBcOIZFnQjeOCSlhPFdvkKK2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Exploring possible causes of the tragedy","title":"MH-17: The Untold Story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
