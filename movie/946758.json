She had never had a beau. Andy Donovan, a new boarder, caused her first flutter and regret for her unattractiveness. A description in a lurid novel of the grief-stricken heroine and the attention she attracted in her garb of woe gives Mary an idea and - two weeks later she appears fashionably attired in Fifth avenue mourning - and weeps forth a tale to the now sympathetic Andy of a dead fianc√©, the Count Mazzini.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hzCpmscdVF8u6k0ybfMyS90ez1M.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitagraph Company of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1918-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Count and the Wedding Guest","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
