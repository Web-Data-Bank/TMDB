Not quite a serial, not quite a newsreel and not strictly an advertisement, it combined elements of all three. In 52 weekly one-reel episodes, running from January 19, 1914 to January 11, 1915, the Mutual Girl outwitted villains, saw the sights of New York, met with theatrical and political celebrities (who frequently helped her out of trouble) and tried on fashionable outfits in chic stores. The fashions were an early example of product placement, although apparently not paid placement.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vfD3JRMzbrAm6iGyU5OeLp03PIp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":90606,"logo_path":null,"name":"Reliance Film Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1914-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Shows us all about the latest Parisian craze of the \"colored wig\" or the coiffure to match the dress, together with all the latest in the world of dress and fashion.","title":"Our Mutual Girl","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
