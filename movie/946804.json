A band from the same era as Sweet, David Bowie and T-Rex. In the middle of the prog wave, the band chose to invest in an extroverted expression with make-up, glitter and spectacular stage shows. A unique band in Sweden of that time not only for how they looked but also for their sound. Nowadays, the members of Tears are older men, but it still happens that they put on make-up and take to the stage. Ola Salo (The Arc) is one of Tears biggest fans and speaks passionately about the band's history and glam rock in general.","popularity":0.641,"poster_path":"/uEyOM702AXwaLH6J3A405e77a1s.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":171160,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tulpa Creatives","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2021-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Glam, Sweat & Tears","video":false,"vote_average":1.0,"vote_count":1}
