Viewers can experience the work with their hearts in their hands. The heart in the animation vibrates at the same pace at viewers' heartbeat. Viewers encounter a rusted robot, absolutely static. He doesn’t have a “heart” to move. Viewers can grant him a new heart by putting theirs on the robot. He then stands up and starts to move, expressing joy to live out all his strength. However, when he meets with new robots, he doesn’t know how to communicate properly. “Heart” becomes the key to move the story forward. The story aims to arouse consciousness of “Heart” via the growth of the robot.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pwn2DwRXGzhuSU93x5f3iGZhnHt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2020-01-28","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beat","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
