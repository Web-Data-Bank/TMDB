Young people from the suburbs all over France – often still in college or high school - came together each night to burn dustbins, cars, even schools. The riot prompted the decree of a state of emergency – something that has not been seen in France since the years of the war of independence in Algeria. In an effort towards appeasement, the government made promises to come to the aid of “abandoned” areas. Today, one year later, what has changed for the people in the suburbs? Have they managed to pick up the pieces? Have official bodies managed to transform promises into real measures on the field? Alice Diop - who grew up in neighboring Aulnay – took the temperature of the area in and around Clichy, the place where the riots broke out following the deaths of two of the town’s youngsters who perished in an electrical transformer station while fleeing from the police.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/98PPnIJHcoXc1KXYZLHObiIpu4b.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":86197,"logo_path":"/gUTZ1JDzJOytALYfXtPJKI1MqGp.png","name":"Point du Jour","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-06-06","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Clichy pour l'exemple","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
