Through sound and image, the film immerses viewers in the rainforest, and makes audible myriad connections between the everyday sounds of the rainforest biosphere and the creative practices of singing to, with, and about it by the Bosavi people. Structured around a day in the life of the rainforest and the music it inspires for the Bosavi people, the film brings to life the everyday activities of work, leisure, and ritual-heard in the full ambient setting of the rainforest-throughout the day and night.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/di7RzHjkCG8Kxzh8hLef0THTiab.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PG","name":"Papua New Guinea"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":69,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Voices of the Rainforest: A Day in the Life of Bosavi","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
