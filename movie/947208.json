Animator Wayne Traudt creates a striking visual rendition of renowned Qawwali singer Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan's vocals as he performs 'Tracery,' composed by Michael Brooks. As Fateh Ali Khan's voice performs agile pyrotechnics, Traudt invents a visual experience to match. Together, the music and the animation resonate. The body movements echo the phrasing of the music with grace, evoking life and breath, the universal rhythms to which we all dance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pVYlwIGxqKsQG7h7UTR1l0JJEqR.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2000-03-15","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Body Rhythm","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
