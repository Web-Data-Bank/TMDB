Apollo brought Balanchine together for the first time with composer Igor Stravinsky. Their creation for Diaghilev’s Ballets Russes in 1928 remains a masterpiece of neoclassicism in its striking depiction of the young god of music and his three muses. Balanchine’s effervescent Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux breathes life into a long-lost movement from Tchaikovsky’s original score for Swan Lake. Created in 1960 for virtuoso New York City Ballet dancers Violette Verdy and Conrad Ludlow, its thrilling technical challenges are still relished by performers today.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/f6fbUw6i48lzy9pAYaIwCTvxeq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Apollo/ Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux/ Dances at a Gathering","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
