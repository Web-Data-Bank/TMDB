They end up writing a hit and getting a recording contract. The trouble is, the composer's works are never played without another band member doctoring them up to make them swingier. Fortunately, the composer isn't too averse to the changes as he has just won the heart of the beauty who sings his revamped songs. Songs include: \"Where Did You Get That Girl?\" (Harry Puck, Bert Kalmar, sung by Helen Parrish), \"Sergeant Swing,\" \"Rug-Cuttin' Romeo\" (Milton Rosen, Everett Carter).","popularity":1.639,"poster_path":"/cO7sywdpgavlMazA1AOO3NcUJ0z.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":33,"logo_path":"/8lvHyhjr8oUKOOy2dKXoALWKdp0.png","name":"Universal Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1941-01-03","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Where Did You Get That Girl?","video":false,"vote_average":5.0,"vote_count":2}
