The two start a different kind of friendship in which the creature learns that not all human beings are evil and greedy, and Iida learns the truth about her father’s old imaginary friend. Iida and her big brother help the creature build an improvised device to return home, even if this means she will lose an unexpected but dear friend. Little do they know that a few competing international task forces work day and night to track down the whereabouts of earth’s visitors from out of this world to gain access to their vast energy resources.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/opk4U7525FQFiYnWq2BtDuN0Yru.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"My True Imaginary Friend — Mr. Clutterbuck","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
