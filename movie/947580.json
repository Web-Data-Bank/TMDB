The ques­tion is that even if they man­age to beat the queen and her min­ions will the sea­son­al bal­ance be restored? It’s a tale of courage, friend­ship and high adven­ture that shows that even the small­est and frailest of us have an impor­tant role to play in the scheme of things.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zY583Y9HCdFBy9Iwf7LxYTtqsQW.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Planned","tagline":"","title":"Ploey 2: The Legend of the Winds","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
