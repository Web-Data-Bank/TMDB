One of them has just been fired from the RAID following a blunder, the other, an inveterate blunderer, seems to have badly controlled superpowers. During this picaresque odyssey, often bordering on the burlesque, Kharis and Brindelune will meet Lionel and Arthur, two Solex enthusiasts absorbed in an improbable quest worthy of the Knights of the Round Table, as well as Pauline, an extravagant young woman around whom an unspeakable threat hovers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pzdrDFZ86hE1sWscbQIpRRzcng7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":171274,"logo_path":null,"name":"Le Couvoir (FR)","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-10-19","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Solex dans les prés","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
