The zeitgeist exhibited at these conventions was not lost on the band and in 1996 they responded, rising up like a grease painted phoenix into a new era of success. On the surface, KISS fans got exactly what they longed for, but for some the return of their idols brought unexpected consequences. KISS Loves You follows a few KISS fans along the way.","popularity":1.091,"poster_path":"/1uzJEDZzC6FfdVyJStx0Ivwqpyt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-04-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"KISS Loves You","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
