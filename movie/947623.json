When Yoshimi returned home, he found a letter in his mailbox. It was from his \"real father\" who said that he was waiting for him at the beach house and wanted him to come and see him. He didn't immediately believe the story that \"you are not a real child of the family\", but the suggestion that he had a chicken head was true. The next day, Yoshimi leaves the house, ready to never return. Meanwhile, the three women gather at the bus stop and are surprised to find chicken heads hanging from each other's necks. The three quickly become friends and embark on a foolhardy adventure, but they are involved in one bizarre accident after another...  A surreal story and images that seem to make no sense, that seems to continue and break off, that seems to be in the near future and in the past, that seems eerie and wacky. The analogue speed of the film evokes the sensation of a daytime nightmare.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1qa3QA6tpdD3ziwRv8JWvsYKYJy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Led by Chickenhead, where do my daughters go?","title":"Chicken Head","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
