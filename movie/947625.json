As the story unfolds, it veers from the objective to the highly personal. The tape relates the story of Mel Glasser, a recovering schizophrenic who, having adopted the persona of Abraham Lincoln, has made considerable progress in the last twenty years. The tape refuses to romanticize Mel's condition; he speaks frankly with intelligence and humour, and takes Applegath on a special journey.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5TJE0jlHGNuMCyeBx8oFiaw0PZt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1992-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Escaping History","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
