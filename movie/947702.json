Students protesting against the illegal expulsion of their colleagues from university and in defence of play Dziady, directed by Kazimierz Dejmek and performed at the National Theatre, which has been taken off the bill. Among the protesting young people are also Hania and Janek. Their families are on both sides of the March barricade.
