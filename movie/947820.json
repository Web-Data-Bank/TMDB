Although their circumstances and motivations are very different, each character shares a desperation thatâ€™s led them to their booth: a heartbroken transvestite driven to conforming to societal expectations; two young people compelled to risk everything in the hope of a better life; and a lonesome cleaner who goes to extraordinary lengths to attract the attention he so desperately craves. With the help of the camera each character uses deception in pursuit of happiness, demonstrating that appearances are not always as they seem.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/T67pZbFyz8cp9181fxJu35CEsN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-09-09","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Behind every photo is a story...","title":"Snapshots","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
