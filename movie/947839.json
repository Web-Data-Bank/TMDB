The suicide rate in men under 25 has tripled in the last 30 years, and young men in rural and remote communities are particularly vulnerable. This reality has disturbing implications for society. When it affects you directly, it's shattering. In this very personal film, director Jessica Douglas-Henry and her sister Alix explore the impact of their brotherâ€™s suicide.  In 1996 James Dalmann killed himself. He was found dead in the bathroom of his housing commission unit in Geraldton, Western Australia. James was only twenty.  Although this film is about James, it's really Alix's story. It's about the people left behind, whose lives have been changed forever by the suicide of someone they loved.  Although Our Brother James focuses on a personal tragedy, it is ultimately a film about survival and growth, about love, strength and hope for the future.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/78IzzWWvoYMg6X5U7zd66ybs1f.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"This is a film about love, strength & hope but it begins with a tragedy","title":"Our Brother James","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
