In their home country, they lure young women with the prospect of a secure future in Europe - a fateful promise. Because it leads to forced prostitution. The women pay thousands of euros for the often illegal journey. Once there, the human traffickers demand the money back and force the young women into prostitution. They are put under psychological pressure by an archaic \"Yuyu\" ritual intended to prevent them from escaping and escaping their tormentors. \"Without demand, the business would not exist,\" says social worker Princess Inyang Okokon. She herself had fallen into the hands of human traffickers, but managed to get out and is now helping other women to break out of forced prostitution. The documentary accompanies the committed Italian prosecutor Lina Trovato and the German investigator Colin Nierenz in their work and tells of the fate of young Nigerian women who managed to escape from forced prostitution","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kKupn5woE5awyWPHdXXhGJ6aLmJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2022-03-08","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Verhängnisvolle Versprechen: Das nigerianische Netzwerk","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
