Together they discuss the daily confrontations they face as a girl and a woman. What expectations should they meet? What taboos perpetuate shame? Bad experiences and fear of men are also discussed, just like the clinical blue blood in sanitary towel commercials, transgressive behavior and unwanted dick pics.
