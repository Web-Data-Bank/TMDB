All the boy wants is to dispose of his date's dead dog Jasper and get back to the babe who's so hot she mutters darkly about being a Pressure Cooker: his conventional efforts are continually thwarted. Quaid is respected by the peculiar groups he interests in the dog's corpse and effects, and our one-gloved heroine is much keener on him than on her rather lackluster date.","popularity":1.526,"poster_path":"/y7C9UGYkmrRgaM43ekK9q1iPNFu.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1951,"logo_path":null,"name":"Aspen Film Society","origin_country":""},{"id":20076,"logo_path":"/i9qXGJIP9fGN22PP5jXUVENbyHi.png","name":"HandMade Films","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1990-09-06","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cold Dog Soup","video":false,"vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":9}
