If as he often remarked, he never met a man he didn't like, it is also true that Rogers never met a man he didn't like to make fun of. Everyone from congressmen and Presidents to Hollywood movie moguls and wealthy industrialists bore the brunt of his gently lacerating wit--and seemed, mostly, to be charmed in the process. So popular did Rogers become--through dozens of films, a daily column that ran for nine years in newspapers across the country, and countless lectures and stage performances--that he was often urged to run for Congress and even the Presidency. Upon receiving a mock appointment as Congressman-at-Large for the whole United States, Rogers protested, \"I regret the disgrace that's been thrust upon me here tonight. I've tried to live my whole life so that I would never become a congressman.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yTLaFUy7cEoOxWXi3zNzNdqfofl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Will Rogers: An American Original","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
