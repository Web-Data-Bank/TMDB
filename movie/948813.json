We do know that just as the music is moving ahead, left to right, the camera and dancers will too. And we know that just as the music suspends you out of time - feeling like both 1972 and 2022 - our vision will too. Boys Will Be Toys is an eight-minute dance piece that fuses two unique songs. It is a fast, sensory, exhilarating ride, weaving you through feelings of attachment and detachment from the body - and the needs of the body.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/koCHMXeRKICV5vnAdhuEojYzIcv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Be pure, be vigilant... behave","title":"Boys Will Be Toys","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
