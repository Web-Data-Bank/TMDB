Their goal is to counter the government narrative about their practice.  In the aftermath, police raids sweep Changchun City, and comic book illustrator Daxiong (Justice League, Star Wars), a Falun Gong practitioner, is forced to flee. He arrives in North America, blaming the hijacking for worsening an already violent repression. But his views are challenged when he meets the lone surviving participant to have escaped China, now living in Seoul, South Korea.","popularity":0.676,"poster_path":"/ilmtlLm7JJJMlRLoatCM6umKWYT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":171496,"logo_path":"/skjnKMbYiGNRo9nMWaVI2RUvdQi.png","name":"Lofty Sky Pictures","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":806,"logo_path":"/kcNh09qqR2Pkw1JAzRW4CommrW4.png","name":"Téléfilm Canada","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2022-10-14","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The heist of China's airwaves","title":"Eternal Spring","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
