Pick up the voices of the residents. We interviewed mountain villages and remote islands in Hokkaido, Tohoku, China, and Kyushu. The aging of villages and the rapid decrease of households affect all the lives of residents such as school consolidation, agriculture and forestry, and living road management, and the decline in village (community) functions is further accelerating remote villages.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":77483,"logo_path":null,"name":"Iwanami Productions","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1973-03-13","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ドキュメンタリー映画「過疎地帯」","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
