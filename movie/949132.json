For years, people communicated with each other without obstacles: getting married, visiting each other for baptisms or other family celebrations, and sometimes even for a glass of wine. Things have changed since the Dniester became a border river. A check in point appeared on the left bank, which controls and authorizes crossings from one bank to another. Ever since the bans were imposed, people go out on the shore and communicate by shouting because the \"screaming\" is not subject to prohibitions and does not involve any costs. Ana and Vasile Manea lived in their youth on the left bank, then moved to the right, while their children chose to live on the other side. Such twisted connections are plentiful in these two villages.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/w1FZ2yrmwaTMPAeWQz85pyd2fNw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110517,"logo_path":null,"name":"Telefilm Chisinau","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MD","name":"Moldova"}],"release_date":"2021-07-16","revenue":0,"runtime":70,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Riverbanks","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
