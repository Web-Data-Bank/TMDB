It tells the story of one's battle with self-love through black-and-white imagery. After being cast in the lead role of a professional ballet, Ragan is pressured by the ballet’s director to lighten her skin with make-up, in order to be consistent with the white dancers on stage. She reluctantly goes along with the request, but with each performance in the lighter make-up, she feels more degraded. When a young adoring fan tells her she wants to be just like her, the dancer cannot continue to perform feeling such shame. She makes a decision to be authentic, and dance freely, in her own skin.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"En Avant","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
