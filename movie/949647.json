Following the Parti Québécois’ proposed Quebec Charter of Values in 2013, the Insoumis focused their attention on issues around identity, and their concerns crystallized into a fear of the ‘Islamization’ of Quebec. The group’s ideological contradictions and confusion are slowly revealed before the camera, but so is a troubling familiarity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gzNOpQG0BAzILarcJNenT05UP8h.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":38201,"logo_path":"/fYolDp6ajIDXiMsXYXHXcWyNIYe.png","name":"Colonelle Films","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2017-10-30","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Minoritaires","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
