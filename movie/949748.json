Conceptually arranged in to a film “album”, Lion’s seven works navigate atomic fallout and a girl’s adolescence, a dream before death, radiation as a cause and cure for cancer, masculine bravado, feminine obsession, a trip to Chernobyl amongst the death of a matriarch, and the destruction of memory. Composed of seven works, Lion is a series of films created on 16mm and hand processed with darkroom techniques that mimic the effects of radiation on film. Researched in Chernobyl, the series is a product of memories, history, pop culture and technical experiments to create visual representations of invisible forces.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5rN9toODPtzyi1rIzmyZaaMcDFp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lion","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
