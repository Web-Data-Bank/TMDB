Unfettered by conscience, Walton opens a disreputable pool hall and hires Tony, an Italian ex-convict, as a pool hustler. The pool hall becomes a meeting place for criminals and naïve young men, including Elmer, a bank messenger, and Bingham, the neglected son of wealthy parents. One night at a cabaret, Bingham and Tony meet O'Neil’s daughter, Hazel. Tony borrows Bingham’s car without permission and takes Hazel for a late-night drive. After Bingham reports the theft to police, a chase ensues, and Hazel is killed when the car is struck by a locomotive. While detectives wait for Tony at the pool room, they thwart a pair of thugs who attempt to rob Elmer. The bank messenger confesses that he learned to gamble at the pool room, prompting the authorities to force Walton out of business. Tony survives the wreck and is taken into custody.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":1282,"logo_path":null,"name":"Selig Polyscope Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1915-12-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Making of Crooks","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
