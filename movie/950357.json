The bust of the great poet Luis de Cam√µes recalls the epic discoveries and the glory of navigators. The director observes the Chinese people, their activities, their hobbies. He seems fascinated and, perhaps in spite of himself, shows us a very dynamic Chinese city where the Portuguese seem to be tourists.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1923-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Macao - Progress and Monuments","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
