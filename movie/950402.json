It presents a panorama of the benefits of the singular Portuguese presence, which harmoniously rubs shoulders with peoples and cultures: Macao, its cathedral, junks and casinos; the dances of the Timorese; Cape Verde and its morna; the Tchiloli Theatre of São Tomé; the riches of Angola and the development of Mozambique. And several sequences expose at length the Portuguese military power, especially in Guinea-Bissau and Angola – while a part of these countries is actually under control of the separatists. The film is punctuated by the words of Prime Minister Marcelo Caetano, who replaced Salazar in 1968: “These terrorist movements did not appear spontaneously, they originate in a neighbouring territory, and they would have disappeared if the help of the neighbouring powers had stopped. The people of our territories are fighting them.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le Portugal d’Outre-mer dans le monde d’aujourd’hui","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
