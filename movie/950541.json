Set in the Florida Everglades, this ambitious piece is a contemporary fairy tale. A young woman struggles to free herself from a small town and her demanding, eccentric family. Her search leads to her doppelganger, a mysterious woman — half-human, half-bird — who lives in the mangrove swamps outside town. In confronting the psychological Other, she comes to terms with her own spiritual dilemma. This quest for self-identity resonates with the archetypal themes of such fairy tales as Beauty and the Beast and Cinderella. In a narrative shot through with ambiguity and hidden meanings, the languorous, menacing landscape acts as a visual metaphor for the human imagination.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Everglades City","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
