Evoking subconscious memory, Remains Vivid recalls childhood experiences through use of the \"after-image,\" while Over/Time subtly transposes physical and temporal distance as contrasting, equally resonant landscapes. POV explores the subjective eye versus the camera eye, and the nature of artistic creation. Using a split-screen technique, Similar Nature dissects the activities of four people in a study of time, motion, and simultaneity of gesture. Sax and Violins is a conflation of sound and fragmented image in which the musicians perform separately and are brought together only in the post-production process.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gXvctN9A8fozXjFF0buKGIt4vXL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Resolution of the Eye","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
