In November of 2020, Gerald Varga, his roommate, actor David Quast, and Gerald's long-time collaborator, Darren Andrichuk, were all reported missing. Evidence at the residence shared by Varga and Quast seemed to suggest foul play, though no bodies were ever recovered. In the spring of 2021, an anonymous colleague of Gerald Varga's received a package containing all the raw footage for \"My Inner Demon: A Geraldson Tale\" along with extensive notes detailing how it was to be cut. The film you are about to see comprises the chief piece of evidence in this ongoing investigation and offers the only clues as to what really happened to Gerald Varga, David Quast, and Darren Andrichuk.","popularity":1.181,"poster_path":"/uPfgYxJ2BkAhb4WFbxrspK0w4B0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":171801,"logo_path":null,"name":"Angry Dog Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":171802,"logo_path":null,"name":"HALF-A-GSIX","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"2022-03-19","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Inner Demon: A Geraldson Tale","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
