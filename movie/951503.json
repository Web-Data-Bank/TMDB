They have in more recent history fled Laos as refugees and resettled in the Americas, Australia, and Europe. This documentary was filmed in Chang Khian, a village in the mountains of Northern Thailand. With the traditional, year-long process of transforming the bark of hemp plants into cloth, the complex relationships of men and women are revealed. Women produce the cloth and clothing as the men perform healing ceremonies, settle marriage agreements, and conduct funeral rights. The ready availability of mass-produced, inexpensive cloth combined with the fact that the cultivation of hemp is now illegal has brought the continuation of this traditional practice into question. This film is of great interest to the study of gender and kinship, textiles, traditional crafts, shamanism, and social change.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Threads of Life: Hemp and Gender in a Hmong Village","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
