It shapes our identities, builds communities and nourishes our souls.  Food for the Rest of Us presents 4 inspirational stories of people living life on their own terms, serving as leaders and role models who are lending their voice to the underdog and leading a revolution to a better world, from the ground up!  An Indigenous-owned, youth-run organic farm in Hawaii, and Black urban grower in Kansas City who runs a land-farm at East High School, a female Kosher Butcher in Colorado working with the Queer Community and an Inuit community on the Arctic Coast who are adapting to climate change with a community garden in a small geodesic dome, all show us new ways of relating to how we grow, cook, sell and serve.  Exploring the relationship between Black Lives Matter, Idle No More, Times Up and grassroots food movements, the film shows us how powerful food can be for building and empowering communities and inspiring change.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uxhoCBC0ICUyayLkgj7FYxWUtMG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Food for the Rest of Us","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
