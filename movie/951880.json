Imagine a story about hope, despair, occupation, globalization and politics all centered on a small red fruit - a strawberry. The mother seedlings come from Israel to Gaza and there in the fields of Beit Lihi the seedlings grow into a red strawberry intended for marketing to Europe. In this fateful year in Gaza, the director, accompanied by the Gazan team, documented the agricultural cycle of growing strawberries. The various stages, the hopes, the disappointments, the political events that immediately affected the lives of the farmers. Between green fields, red fruits, sky and sea, an almost pastoral picture emerges for a moment of farmers trying to find the warmth with hard and arduous handwork of the land. But in Gaza the laws of nature don't rule, the occupation does.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-07-06","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"the story of a strawberry who wanted independence","title":"Red Fields","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
