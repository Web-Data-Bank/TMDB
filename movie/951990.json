In a perverse twist, the film invites the viewer to be at once soothed and repulsed by the seething display of the flag and what it leads to. The film establishes a tension between visual beauty and narrative and thematic concerns. ECHO ANTHEM is made up of three sections, each suggesting the same sequence of events. The viewer is challenged to fluctuate between states - from being engulfed by the visuals to being concerned about the narrative particulars and thematic possibilities.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bPfNlKhEFF7YvLlA66YEfjW9gmd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Echo Anthem","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
