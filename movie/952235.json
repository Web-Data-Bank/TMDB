Now he has to face a new challenge: to survive freedom.  Curtis was only 22 when he was sentenced to death for a crime he didn’t commit and spent 22 years in prison, 19 of them in death row, buried alive below ground in a concrete room with no windows, waiting to be executed, in Oklahoma State Penitentiary. “A Declaration Of Love” by Director Marco Speroni, aims to give voice to a man who is being cruelly persecuted by a perverse legal system, digging into his deepest and most hidden emotions. The film is a visual journey through Curtis’s glance and his sense of displacement towards a world where he doesn’t belong anymore. “A Declaration Of Love” is a singular way of addressing the barbarity of the death penalty and also a chance to explore a crucial question: what does “freedom” mean in a society that refuses a person like Curtis despite all he went through?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iMB8QWTnOLp9X9fRw9bD0ydxlbl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":125795,"logo_path":null,"name":"Nacne","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2021-06-07","revenue":0,"runtime":61,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Declaration of Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
