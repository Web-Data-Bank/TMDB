Here multiple entities, objects, pulses, forms, colors and figures all co-habit and co-exist according to an altered rhythm and order, the percussive rhythm of an audiovisual and cinetic teponaztli. Our Teponaztli implies a singular perceptive transformation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tGgAEPNN37IL0618FZeuh7C4bDX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"}],"release_date":"2022-03-18","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Teponaztli","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
