In these communities there is no infrastructure, no development programs in public services, and total neglect in the area of social security. The problem derives from a process of accelerated urbanization that has overwhelmed any planning attempt. No one is more aware of this reality than the people who suffer from it; so, they decided to organize themselves and with imagination, with daring, and above all with decision, diverse groups face and solve their problems themselves.
