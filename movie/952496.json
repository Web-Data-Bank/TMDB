The second instance, that of the domestic worker, the one who goes into someone else's house, almost always comes from the countryside and receives a salary for her work. This woman also suffers from the hostility of her job, isolation and loneliness, and in many cases, discrimination. And the third, the domestic worker by the day, on whom the hardest work falls and who is totally unprotected especially in old age. In all three modalities work has no social recognition. Women are classified as economically inactive, alongside the disabled and beggars. But the most important reflection of this video is that domestic work is a job that is not shared by both sexes; this has been traditionally assigned to women.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1987-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Invisible Worker","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
