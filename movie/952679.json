He is Philippe Koudjina, who was once a successful photographer. In 1960s during the euphoria that followed independence, young people danced the twist and rock ‘n’ roll. Koudjina took snapshots and made a good living. Now, his negatives are decaying in a rusty cabinet.  These snapshots now have artistic value. In Paris and New York, large sums are paid for photography like this. There is hope for Koudjina as two French connoisseurs are now trying to launch his work on the art circuit.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9rOFX5WAhOHNkzQkE9E3Oui24Ah.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Photo Souvenir","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
