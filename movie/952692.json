Who are they? Which ones? Do you need someone other than yourself? What do we know about their loneliness? And what, in fact, lies behind the statistics of teenage suicides, according to which Russia ranks first in Europe. Six stories that happened in one summer: a house, a dacha, a camp and another amazing place that influenced the life of one of them. Who will be on the edge of that very roof, and who will decide never to climb it again? Why? Starting this movie, none of the crew knew how it would end.
