He would like to be a pacifist and struggles to be fair to the Palestinians, but has to contend with the prying eyes of his superiors. The problems Yaniv faces at home are no easier. His mother is a wheelchair bound hard-right-winger due to the same terrorist attack that killed her husband. The story centers on Yaniv's relationship with his younger brother, Avi, who attends one of the few mixed Jewish-Arab schools in Israel, and builds towards an incident at the checkpoint that challenges all involved to reconsider their previous resolve.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/59Iax2hJvECVgFpuYpiBAw3TiGk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IL","name":"Israel"}],"release_date":"2013-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Hebrew","iso_639_1":"he","name":"עִבְרִית"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.","title":"Checkpoint","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
