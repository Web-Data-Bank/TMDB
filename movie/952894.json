The woman pulls water out of the well, but the handle hits her several times. While the barber is sharpening his razor, the client's beard reaches his waist. The farmer stepped on the hoe and it hit him. A blacksmith can't strike iron while it's hot. The dog does not chase the wolf, but bites its owner. A mouse eats a cat. In the finale, it turns out that the only thing the villagers can do normally is to play a folk dance. In their hands, the dancers hold sickles and hammers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hxhwdQxaKiPENIHfSNCVyqwBhPI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1980-07-09","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pastoral","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
