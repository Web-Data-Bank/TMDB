The prayer that he originally said was only to repair the leaking roof tiles of his house and buy Mbah Kedah Nasi Padang, increased when his grandmother who took care of him from the baby fell in the bathroom, was hospitalized, and required a lot of money. Instead of being granted, Adi lost his job as a polisher because his friends in the profession revealed that Adi was a woman. Women are prohibited from participating in polishing, because it can cause \"excessive\" compassion from potential customers. It was at the lowest point that his prayer was answered, Adi found a bag containing hundreds of millions, but led him to disaster.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xF7JZh3Gu6iyu9RCT466A2bGqLo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":164870,"logo_path":null,"name":"Merpati Films","origin_country":""},{"id":148904,"logo_path":"/oEp0EY7zGqYShh3zzyzGWIYJzlJ.png","name":"Klikfilm Production","origin_country":"ID"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"2022-04-02","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tuhan, Minta Duit!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
