Now re-edited and transferred to today's university classroom, it is intended to facilitate anthropology students who are preparing to enter the field study phase, and by watching this film, it will trigger them to think about the opportunity of academic docking between theory and research sites, and further transition them into their own fieldwork thinking.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6x6PbW8CtGhdFleFS2C4RROGGjb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1998-03-05","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Field Study Along the Yangtze River","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
