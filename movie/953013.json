And he is certainly a historical person. People enter history in different ways - he entered with a movie spotlight. Yakov Markovich has been working as an illuminator at the Russian Central Documentary Film Studio for almost 57 (!) years. Over the years, he traveled around the country, saw many famous and important people (including all the political leaders of the country - from Stalin to Yeltsin). And he also \"illuminated\" the era. It was thanks to the light of the searchlights installed by him that it was possible to capture on film almost all the main political events of the second half of the twentieth century.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-03-02","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Let There Be Light!","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
