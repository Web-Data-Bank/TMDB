The three main characters of the film, Mustafa, Mehmet and Yusuf migrated to Istanbul from small towns and come from conservative families. The film reveals each characters’ world: exhausted from continually playing at social roles and lying about their identity, faltering between their reality and their dreams, frustrated and stuck in their lives. It also looks at the subject from the aspect of women who are the other victims of these marriages. Mehmet and Yusuf, both married to women, act the part of heterosexual males and family men within their own social circles.","popularity":0.667,"poster_path":"/yZwmQVxspVJSsZ5LftbFsFjQEz2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":172139,"logo_path":"/e0JriTVNY8c0QzLvXWUHmOUQhLx.png","name":"ArtHood Entertainment","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TR","name":"Turkey"}],"release_date":"2022-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This Is Not Me","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1}
