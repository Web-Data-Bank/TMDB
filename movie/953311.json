An intentionally crude cartoon with a live action epilogue in which Milius appears with Gayle Hunnicutt. The film was made when Milius was a student at the University of Southern California and was a parody of Italian cinema. The film was edited by George Lucas. Milius' first film is important because it was the beginning point for his contribution of a style emphasizing depth and meaning in American popular films.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9VxkwOeT6A8Je6Hm9oAJAA8eOxi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1973-02-23","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marcello, I'm Bored","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
