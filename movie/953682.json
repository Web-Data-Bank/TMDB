Done in cartoon animation, the film traces the growth of the typical city, from a tiny settlement in the vast North American wilderness to the car-clogged metropolis that so many cities are today. Film without words.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xQySxUo0i4XRsUY2KLJp2zPP6oE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1968-10-22","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boomsville","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
