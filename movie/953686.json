This is an escape from a merry-go-round of painted horses suddenly turned to flesh and blood, making a wild plunge for freedom. But these are horses of extraordinary colour--lime, mauve, bronze and gold--as if caught in some mysterious kaleidoscope of the dawn. A triumph of technical virtuosity, these unusual effects were achieved in the printing process.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jRigSzoXMnaU4sXJiK3mvVABsKc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1968-09-16","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Carrousel","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
