How he is jolted into the metric age, and how he discovers its advantages, makes an amusing cartoon screen adventure for anyone who sees George's problem but, like him, resists the idea of change to a simpler way of figuring the size and weight of things.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vwYquxNrpEt0rWycNgjdcNlz0Ov.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1973-07-12","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ten: The Magic Number","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
