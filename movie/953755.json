He expedites the ubiquitous Marshall Efron on a fact-finding mission north of the border. Part satire, part serious, this film sets out to package Canada for American consumption, with some of the clich√©s thrown in. Contrasting with the decidedly lighter side of the film are interviews with well-known Canadians such as Marshall McLuhan, Mordecai Richler, Margaret Atwood, John Kenneth Galbraith, Raoul Duguay, and Pierre Bourgault.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/82tQaDkxjugORGz6pUDvRK418mU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1979-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"What the Hell's Going On Up There?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
