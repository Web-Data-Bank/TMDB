Functioning inside a black frame that manipulates him and restricts him to his daily routine, he struggles to free himself. Through an act of creative energy, he stands his life on end and starts anew. A wonderfully fresh and freewheeling film that tells a serious story lightly.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wPsPy1eKQSp6Y0eA0VBILxZrjCi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1984-06-05","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bounds","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
