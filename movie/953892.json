With a few deft strokes, the film portrays the hardships these people had to endure in their struggle for survival. The film's focus is on the life of one family whose autumn harvesting days are coloured by the death of a neighbour during childbirth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iFEa2ywzsk42cj4d3xO0Wrq5aC5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10473,"logo_path":"/lMUDQZVtg8On4PAW5XFQPaQy6UK.png","name":"ONF | NFB","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"1986-08-09","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Debts","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
