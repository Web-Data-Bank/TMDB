Hamedah fled from an abusive relationship and found refuge at the home of her cousin, who was selling drugs. When her cousin was arrested, prosecutors also charged Hamedah as a conspirator in the drug-selling operation. What happened next shocked Hamedah, bewildered her attorneys and outraged even the Bush-appointed federal judge who sentenced her, calling this \"the most grotesque perversion of justice I can think of.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gUVf9rg3AXa97TXfgbMTWfUhPTB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"\"What about my children?\"","title":"Perversion of Justice","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
