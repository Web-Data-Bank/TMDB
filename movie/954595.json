Fiorenza Cossotto sings the role of Adriana’s nemesis, the Princess of Bouillon, and José Carreras is Adriana’s lover, Maurizio, in this live 1976 performance from Tokyo. The NHK Symphony Orchestra is under the direction of Gianfranco Masini.  This performance of Adriana Lecouvreur documents the art of Montserrat Caballé at its peak, the soprano employing her singularly ravishing vocal quality and staggering technical facility fully in the service of the drama. In her portrayal of the title character - described in the opera as a supreme tragedienne, self-trained and completely artless - Caballé matches Adriana's attributes with a naturalistic approach that is profoundly moving in its honesty and directness. This production also boasts the presence of Fiorenza Cossotto and José Carreras, stars of the highest caliber with whom Caballé performed this opera on many occasions all over the world.","popularity":0.654,"poster_path":"/oQJpS15fxVZTl1UM8t708H2t3NI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":147,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cilea - Adriana Lecouvreur - Caballe, Cossotto, Carreras (NHK 1976)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
