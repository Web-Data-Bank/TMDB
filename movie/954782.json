In the 1970s, the city along with big business interests planned to redevelop the Fourth Ward in order to revitalize the dilapidated real estate and freshen the image of downtown Houston. The price of progress in this case would be the removal of many poor black families.

Who makes the decisions about where resources are spent and so determines the growth and wealth of the community.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7YXVXPYBjlje0jbYB2FEV7FbQSv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97962,"logo_path":null,"name":"KUHT Film Production","origin_country":""},{"id":124017,"logo_path":"/ioSRRQqdux1jFOxjBI5jUxcruGW.png","name":"PBS","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1978-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":173,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"This is the story of a small downtown neighborhood which sees itself caught in the wake of the city's growth","title":"Who Killed Fourth Ward?","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
