Note that this was one of the approximately 100 \"sexy nocturne\" mondo style documentaries that were produced between 1959 and 1970, mainly in Italy. They are documentaries that include segments of strippers, which allowed them to include nudity that had formerly only been seen in nudist movies. The strippers are shown performing their acts, and there was an attempt to film them artistically.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9VL3qxwZdw4TkX6hN5HDkp6laSL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4498,"logo_path":null,"name":"Arco Film","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":4779,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinematografica Associati (CI.AS.)","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1962-11-09","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Notti calde d'Oriente","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
