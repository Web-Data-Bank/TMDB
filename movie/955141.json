Michael (Derrick Pierce) tenses but plays it cool, telling him that his step-daughter is not feeling so well today. When Michael returns to Katie, who obediently and sensually licks the icing he scooped off the cupcake from his finger, it seems like he's anything but a good step-father.  After looking for her friend Emma (Kay Carter), Lucy (Jojo Kiss) finally finds her having a perfectly friendly chat with Lucy's step-dad, Mr. Edwards (Dick Chibbles). Emma gushes that \"I had no idea your step-dad's a policeman, Lucy, you never talk about him!\" Lucy seems in a hurry to bring Emma back to her room, saying they should get back to studying.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tyyJBxSEPD0KoB2trnyrGfVmEJZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97187,"logo_path":"/8b3EX6zgcWIBhlAMJjlaX8j35hS.png","name":"Pure Taboo","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-11-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Daddy's Special Hug","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
