Logical chains enchain and imprison us.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bWWIcvFblLw7yOVKnDsgRWF8g8N.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1982-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Experiencias PLAT en Super 8","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
