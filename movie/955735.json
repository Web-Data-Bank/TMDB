Claudio Abbado became Artistic Director of the Berlin Philharmonic in 1989 shortly after the death of Herbert von Karajan. His appointment was a surprise to many and there were a few unsettled years, but Abbado and the BPO soon became accustomed to each other and the partnership has produced countless superb performances. Particularly in the last few years they have been working together magnificently, evidenced in a number of their recordings. Abbado of course is an old hand at Beethoven; he has recorded complete sets of the symphonies with both the Vienna and Berlin Philharmonic Orchestras.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/Al7gQaWWggMAwPF7NCsOdmQewXM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Beethoven Symphonies 4 7 - Berliner POAbbado","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
