The whole year we have lived in the atmosphere of revolution, then war. Whatever you did - you saw these things in the background, you always mean them, although you live not even on a border of war, but deep in in the rear. I want to remember this year, I want to keep the memory of all the people who surrounded me. The year of Maidan, the year marked by war and peace.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mJuWYwf9ax7jDTcp9HLL2T12vpF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2015-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":38,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Maidan Is Everywhere","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
