These mobilizations took place in a context of economic crisis in the country and growing political and social conflict. Filmmakers Mario Handler, Alberto Miller and Marcos Banchero recorded some of these mobilizations at the time, contributing to the visibility of this sector of society, whose conditions of exploitation had been unknown to the capital's gaze until then.  Cañeros, by Mario Handler, records the 1965 march and was made within the framework of the Instituto de Cinematografía de la Universidad de la República.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1965-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sugar Cane Workers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
