Discover the piece at the Salzburg Festival in the hands of conductor Teodor Currentzis, the ensemble musicAeterna, Anna Prohaska (soprano), Katharina Magiera (contralto), Mauro Peter (tenor), and Tareq Nazmi (bass).  Few musical works are as steeped in legend as Mozart’s Requiem in D minor, K. 626. Commissioned anonymously by the eccentric count Franz von Walsegg, the funereal oeuvre would become Mozart’s last: when he died on December 5, 1791, only the Requiem aeternam and Kyrie movements were fully composed and orchestrated. Completed by other composers (Mozart’s student Franz Xaver Süssmayer in particular) using Mozart’s sketches and notes, the resulting work weaves the emotions we associate with death into a timeless musical exploration of every human being’s destiny, and constitutes a powerful final testament to its creator’s genius.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7ovv3TzZqqa3HTHeBzyzBKIsCxb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26290,"logo_path":"/o7QeTO6M5CLKZP7RYuIxoHbTqET.png","name":"Unitel","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":161584,"logo_path":"/sPdlHrkSpsIKkm5burGL5QB7PbX.png","name":"ZDF/3Sat","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":3391,"logo_path":"/t0QBs2fI3mE3HxgoH1n39bYuzNu.png","name":"ORF","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-07-23","revenue":0,"runtime":55,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Latin","iso_639_1":"la","name":"Latin"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Salzburg Festival 2017: Mozart, Requiem in D minor, K. 626","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
