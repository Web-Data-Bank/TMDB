Calls from his parents in China inquiring after his marital status blend with calls from his boyfriend asking about his job prospects, each underscoring the reality that the student visa that brought him to Europe will soon end. With time running out, Yao faces tough questions about his relationship with his family, culture, and his sense of self. Seeking release, he turns to drag. Shifting between observational footage, paper puppetry, and poetic symbolism, Yao explores expressions of sexual identity in this essay about queerness, immigration, and performance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iyzruEpftdY9JFOtwiXaDO0TPJo.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"release_date":"2022-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hungarian","iso_639_1":"hu","name":"Magyar"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"An extremely intimate journey through the world of drag with a Chinese twist","title":"My Dear","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
