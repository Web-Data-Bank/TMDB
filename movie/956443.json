It was the first targeted killing of a journalist in Slovakia's history, and shocked citizens protested on a scale not seen since the fall of communism. Kuciak was well known for covering questionable financial connections between politicians and \"elite\" business tycoons, namely millionaire Marián Kocner. When police failed to meaningfully investigate the prime suspect, journalists mobilized the public. Leaked files, Kuciak's posthumous reports and civic outcry led to scandalous discoveries of decades-old corruption networks involving Kocner and the police chief, high-ranking bureaucrats and the prime minister himself.","popularity":2.303,"poster_path":"/cu7JpLtjQdANlhx4JznYDS1gIhm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29062,"logo_path":"/hwlA6f2HhaOJP1ZcrYL8f8g8UbJ.png","name":"Final Cut for Real","origin_country":"DK"},{"id":182517,"logo_path":null,"name":"OCCRP","origin_country":"US"},{"id":116619,"logo_path":null,"name":"Frame Films","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"DK","name":"Denmark"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-03-23","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Killing of a Journalist","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
