Sophia plays the lottery daily in hopes of changing their economic future, but above all, she dreams of escape. This year, after cutting his contract short, Delroy returns to his family with an engagement ring for Sophiaâ€”and an unexpected diagnosis of terminal cancer. Through a composed, empathetic lens, Andrew Moir chronicles the last days of Sophia and Delroy's relationship as she cares for her new spouse. The film quietly observes Sophia rise to the many challenges presented by her unknown future, in a rural society where women traditionally have little independence. Beautifully observed, Don't Come Searching presents a moving portrait of a resilient, contemporary Jamaican woman, determined to find her own way in life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jf3SbXkW9OvBTTQ7Zdgm3peJEmk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Don't Come Searching","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
