Kang-Won, a Christian living in South Korea, has publicly come out as gay on social media. Although it's an incredibly liberating experience for him, he lives in a society that refuses to accept his reality. Feeling empowered and inspired, Kang-Wan moves to the United States to pursue his dream of theatre. Meanwhile, Ah-Hyun is having difficulty processing his brash decisions, while coming to terms with her own insecurities about the decisions (or lack thereof) that she's made for herself. Queer My Friends is a delicate and compassionate coming-out story, but it's also one of those rare films where filmmaker and subject discover their need for each other, both in the artistic process and in life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uQE9Pg95i2jXjYsxtWFy8L0vIoZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2022-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"I'll see you in hell!","title":"Queer My Friends","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
