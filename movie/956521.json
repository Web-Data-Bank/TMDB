One of the foremost political figures of our time, he reflects on debt, austerity and his battle against the European establishment during Greece's debt crisis. In a master class in economics and oratory, Varoufakis raises urgent questions and contradictions about where our civilization is headed and how power works at the highest levels, and connects economic failure, globalization, democracy, fascism and climate crisis.","popularity":0.652,"poster_path":"/3rzM46cyCWIVm1RL5WnlRqqOLQr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-30","revenue":0,"runtime":250,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Eye of the Storm: The Political Odyssey of Yanis Varoufakis","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
