He has been transferred into a halfway house to slowly reintegrate into society. However, his first day in the house is far from perfect, he is attacked by the house bully and a horrible fight breaks out at the dinner table later that evening. Just when he thinks his stay at the house can't get any worse, one of the house mates is brutally murdered. Naturally, the remaining house mates blame David for the murder. Not even the evidence seems to be in his favor; especially not when the body count starts to rise. Questioning his sanity, David must set forth to prove his innocence and find the real killer...even if it turns out to be himself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1DAVr5UJdWSkGAu1vPyDEHB9mPj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":172566,"logo_path":null,"name":"Decades Apart Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Through the Devil's Eyes","video":false,"vote_average":4.0,"vote_count":1}
