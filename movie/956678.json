Who knows what happened to the one in a splint. Well, she knows but she’s not telling. But she can’t rest on the healing.  There’s bills to pay, and this time she'll make it work. This place will be different. She'll even paint the walls. Make it real pretty. Like a grown-up.  And covers on the bed. And places to sit. Maybe that’s how to make this life stick to the ribs. Kevin is a sleepwalker. He’s awake alright, walking right through the day not sure when it starts and stops and starts again.  He boxed up his life and drove down to move his mom into a nursing home about a year ago. Now, those boxes have collected as much dust as he has. These two broken people are neighbors in a duplex South of Nashville.  They just shuffle and sleep through their broken lives, yards apart, walking the same floor of the same house with a wall running through it. Don't even know each other’s names.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"I Can Feel You Walking","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
