They belong to migrants who were sailing for Europe via neighbouring Libya. Piled up by people smugglers into unseaworthy vessels, they often drown at the start of the dangerous voyage.  According to the UNHCR, 325,000 migrants have arrived in Europe since 2016 after taking the Central Mediterranean sea route that links the Libyan and Tunisian coasts with Italy. Tragically, 9,044 are thought to be missing or dead.  One former fisherman has decided to give their remains a decent burial. Chamseddine Marzoug tends a makeshift “cemetery of the unknown” in the southeastern coastal town of Zarzis or Jarjis, opposite Libya. On a visit to the graveyard, the fisherman shares what inspires him to act as next-of-kin for these anonymous victims of the Mediterranean migrant crisis.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fisher of Men","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
