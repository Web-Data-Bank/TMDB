Despite success abroad, the undiscovered work of Aksel Waldemar Johannessen, an admired contemporary of Edvard Munch, takes nearly three decades to launch. The painter's oil depictions of prostitutes and drunks living in miserable poverty offend the bourgeois aesthetics of Norway's art establishment and challenge the canon to the point of sabotaging his rediscovery. Will rejection by the curatorial staff at the National Museum and gatekeepers of the Munch Museum diminish Johannessen's work?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2bphWiJS2cTiDB0N9wZQ5IzI1p5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"}],"release_date":"2021-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Images of a Nordic Drama","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
