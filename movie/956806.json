In this cinematically striking and poetic documentary, López bravely films her story as a willful act to accept difficult truths while finding beauty in the process of healing. As she defies the cultural silence that pervades her family and confronts her abusive grandfather, who is a Baptist minister, a world of generational abuse unfolds, and she quickly discovers she is not alone. Through archival family footage and intimate moments with her family, López has created a film about confronting painful truths and the beauty one can feel when they reach the other side of grief.","popularity":1.27,"poster_path":"/wjuJfCahVhPZjanG136QiVZxStw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":200349,"logo_path":null,"name":"Corazón Oscuro Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":128100,"logo_path":"/g10mQQuYTsNnytluf1WSGjWkp85.png","name":"Black Public Media (BPM)","origin_country":"US"},{"id":105516,"logo_path":"/j1FgbOz1NFwt6iEhdd05dWwr7Z2.png","name":"Latino Public Broadcasting","origin_country":"US"},{"id":10943,"logo_path":"/9jd9RFYraPpPCz7rpqp5KhrwfAH.png","name":"ITVS","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MT","name":"Malta"},{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-05-03","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Silent Beauty","video":false,"vote_average":2.0,"vote_count":1}
