The sound design features a layering of ambience audio gathered from Los Angeles, New York and Vietnam that I did throughout the year of 2019, overlapped interviews with Stan Brakhage, Jonas Mekas and Nathaniel Dorsky, different sound effects of film grain, film leader, film projector, implicitly paying tribute to the wonder of working with the physical film itself. The final audio is from a recording of my cousin \"mumbling\" when she was 6 months old.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oldZdUC2iSXYrWhNWG0oC4K6jqA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Reverberance","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
