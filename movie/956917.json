Julius meets Arnold Cautious, who lives in an abandoned house on the outskirts of town and introduces himself as a degenerated, strawberry juice-drinking vampire. Julius and Cautious become friends. Together they try to make the Lucky Stone, the recipe for which is in Cautious' grandmother's secret recipe book. Julius wants to give the stone to his estranged parents so they can rediscover their common happiness. Julius and Arnold's laboratory attempts to make the Lucky Stone falter badly time and time again, but they stubbornly pursue their quest for happiness.","popularity":1.164,"poster_path":"/lzZCSBOggdL6nQ6MOnx41YREpxj.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70772,"logo_path":"/4dZxmrKg3uLLnI6oXqOKFIaXrgZ.png","name":"Art Films Production","origin_country":"FI"},{"id":93635,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tasse Film","origin_country":"LV"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"},{"iso_3166_1":"LV","name":"Latvia"}],"release_date":"2023-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":89,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Arnold Cautious And The Lucky Stone","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
