Midwaste redirects the conversation to how drug policies and racism embedded in pharmacological treatment and biomedical addiction models really make us sick.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Midwaste","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
