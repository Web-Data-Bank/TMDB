The film portrays the belvédère of the Boekentoren, Ghent’s university library, built by Flemish modernist Henry Van De Velde. In a continuous panoramic shot, taken from the centre of the interior, the camera scans both the modernist wooden pillars as the stark windows framing the city skyline and Ghent’s historic towers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/osY9oR00E8UiOzu71DwO8vACU1k.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Boekentoren","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
