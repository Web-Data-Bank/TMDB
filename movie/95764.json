Hart stars in this 1925 silent film as a cowboy intent on claiming land during the 1889 land rush in the Oklahoma Territory. Though hardened from years of taming the new frontier, he falls in love with a beautiful woman. Before he settles down, however, he must contend with men who wish to bring him harm. In the prologue of the 1939 Astor Pictures revival of this film, Hart gives a moving eight-minute introduction-- the first and only time he appeared in a film accompanied by his striking voice.","popularity":0.962,"poster_path":"/kXq1OQALcCToqdf7O9c1DBA0qc3.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32484,"logo_path":null,"name":"William S.
