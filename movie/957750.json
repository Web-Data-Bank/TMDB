The footage shows the systematic exploitation and violence suffered by animals in slaughterhouses and that is deliberately kept hidden by the meat industry.  In order to carry out this documentary, the director, who for years has been carrying out a project against animal exploitation named as «Tras los Muros», has had to use false identities that have allowed him to access all these places.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/b064dGXzBEmKHe5ZxyuW03b8m4G.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":172729,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tras Los Muros","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MX","name":"Mexico"},{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Slaughterhouse.
