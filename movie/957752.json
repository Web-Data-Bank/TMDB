At the time, they were the \"Bioman\": the kings of partying, excess and \"transmutation\". 20 years later, they have mellowed out and lead well-ordered lives. Except... Once a year, when they get together for the WEB: the Bioman Weekend. There, they \"transmute\" hard as they like to say. In short: they drink and sing in a pathetic way.","popularity":45.488,"poster_path":"/ofWJ1UiUFJncIGBV2E9f9CGRFwk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":172730,"logo_path":null,"name":"Zoé \u0026 Cie","origin_country":""},{"id":78298,"logo_path":"/9U7x4fLDn8EVEZTc4usYeJV1uHF.png","name":"Belga Productions","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":149633,"logo_path":null,"name":"Marvelous Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":135948,"logo_path":null,"name":"Amazon","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2023-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":105,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"BDE","video":false,"vote_average":4.739,"vote_count":69}
