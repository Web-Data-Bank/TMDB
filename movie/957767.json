In conversation with Yone Lindgren, a long  time activist and elder in the lesbian community, she learns about the  trajectory of many of her queer elders who are coerced back in the closet,  where they become invisible to society, while younger queers in the  movement search for guidance. This film affirms the necessity of fostering  intergenerational relationships in order to ensure resistance and thriving.  This compassionate portrait urges us to ‘Wake up! Shake off the blues’ and  get involved in mutual care.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-09","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Coming Into Bloom","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
