Summary: On October 13, 1917, at 5 a.m. in the Cova da Iria meadow in Portugal, tens of thousands of people arrived from all over the country. They are waiting in the rain for a so-called miracle announced 3 months earlier by a woman who would have appeared to 3 children. This miracle would be linked to a secret, which would have been entrusted by the Virgin to the three young shepherds on the same day and which fuels controversy and concern. 4 years of investigation and filming in 13 countries were necessary to finally lift the veil on this secret which has terrified the greatest world government, the Vatican, for 101 years.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3OXwsBU75KvRlZhfJawCoy5xwGl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2018-12-25","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Fatima and the 3rd secret","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
