She doesn’t have much, just a guitar in the backseat of her beat-up Ford Taurus, which often serves as a hotel room when she can’t scrounge up enough to get herself a real bed. She’s used to bumps in the road – disgusting gas station bathrooms, cash shortages, homesickness – and has grown accustomed to her solitary lifestyle. When her solo tour makes a stop in a quaint town, she anxiously invites her ex-girlfriend, Phoebe, who’s attending medical school nearby. Jules and Phoebe reconnect almost instantly, and Jules is suddenly faced with everything she’s been missing. Five Song Tour asks, simply, how do we balance the pursuit of creative passion with the need for stability, the comfort of home, and the universal desire for human connection?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/alhHIJeobwXbkvl6l6amSzVephm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Five Song Tour","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
