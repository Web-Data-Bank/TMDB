As she paints, Cita talks about her life in the Washington D.C. area, her cultural heritage, the influence of punk and hip-hop on her life and how she came to fall in love with graffiti in the 1980’s when there were few women drawn to the culture at the time. Cita drew on her Javanese heritage to create a modern woman ornamented in traditional Indonesian jewelry yet rooted in 21st century youth culture. Filmmaker Sara T. Gama's aim was to elevate a woman’s voice from her community and visually tell her story, the result is a short documentary that unfolds Cita’s life as she creates her art, one color at a time.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qJQNSuDZDV8R2ciWwAx1NzRuXtb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-28","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Miss Chelove","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
