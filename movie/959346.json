Originally a study on coal mining it grew as a study of perception and sensitization of a place very few have been to physically but have a vast socio economic and humanitarian implication. The audio-visual nature of this project lets experience one such interpretation which goes against the stereotypical description of a space,like such, a coal mine.  The ethnographic reconstruction of the space happened entirely on a completely different fabric of reality. The installation was entirely made in the campus of Djad both the recording of the audio, video and its related textures.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sb9yZ0K2NXkolR5ltkLwbaPpSXm.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":172930,"logo_path":null,"name":"rishndn.com","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2022-01-08","revenue":100,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Catatonik","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
