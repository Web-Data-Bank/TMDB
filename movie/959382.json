Sharing one of the recurrent stylistic motifs of the Georgian documentaries shown here, an uncanny atmosphere is created by the use of post-production sound and chiaroscuro lighting. In effect, the removal of the bread from the oven is witnessed with the same sense of wonder as would greet the appearance of a flying saucer. When sticking the dough to the tandoor, the baker moves half of his body into this dungeon – an image at once frightening and mesmerising. Nowhere else has bread been seen like this, save perhaps for Night of the Living Bread (Kevin S. O’Brien, 1990). But this is hardly a parody: here the most essential human foodstuff meets an expressionist sensibility. In fact, along with Manoel de Oliveira’s O Pão (also showing this year), Khabazebi presents some of the most beautiful images of our daily bread on screen.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1970-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bread Makers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
