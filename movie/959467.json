A very precise and articulated movement language, shapes this artificial display of reality. The sterile environment articulates the disconnection of recognisable actions and takes the spectator along into an artificial world, drawn from a forgotten past on how to behave as a human being. The two characters take the audience through an altered depiction of reality.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vVY9Vtaw2zfdmVJAVpHhEIB69Dg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"2021-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"ONTKOPPELING","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
