For in many ways, the nondescript sanctum under the grandstand stairs where Bill Shankly and his backroom staff worked together to orchestrate the club’s resurgence epitomised the spirit of the city. It was Liverpool in microcosm.  Astonishing archive footage and a reminder of Liverpool’s collectivist culture reveals how the revered Boot Room Boys brought a city back from the brink and ushered in an unprecedented era of dominance.","popularity":2.321,"poster_path":"/kIE4sjAlQJak9ge7cT89ac0hCYt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":65389,"logo_path":null,"name":"BT Sport Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-04-05","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Tthe fabled Anfield Boot Room","title":"The Boot Room Boys","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
