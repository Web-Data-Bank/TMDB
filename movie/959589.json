Landon’s TikTok goes viral, thrusting him into the spotlight — and leaving Paige behind. When a producer offers Landon the opportunity to adapt the book series into a musical, Landon discovers that the glory of doing it all himself isn’t worth the stress and enlists the help of Paige and the TikTok community to turn the show into a huge success.  For You Paige was influenced by TikTok culture and features many references to TikTok trends and communities. The development and production processes were documented on TikTok by creator Daniel Mertzluff, along with the show’s cast and crew. The musical premiered live at a theater in New York City on April 14, 2022.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7AtZIuzmxN0GaiMAEMe0SjRB9H8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":172958,"logo_path":null,"name":"tik tok","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Inspired by real TikTok creators","title":"For you, Paige","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
