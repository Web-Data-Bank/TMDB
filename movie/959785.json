Palaeontologist Robert DePalma has made an incredible discovery in a prehistoric graveyard: fossilised creatures, astonishingly well preserved, that could help change our understanding of the last days of the dinosaurs. Evidence from his site records the day when an asteroid bigger than Mount Everest devastated our planet and caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. Based on brand new evidence, witness the catastrophic events of that day play out minute by minute.","popularity":5.508,"poster_path":"/xPmf46lk6XwOxDjlvVVTdWvMo2d.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":113381,"logo_path":"/wuLsHAoN6X46X8sLL4RGfrHHSHg.png","name":"BBC Studios Science Unit","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":6773,"logo_path":"/thh8BxybjvOoI618djeXzwhGfh4.png","name":"NOVA","origin_country":"US"},{"id":10197,"logo_path":"/lRah8iyzBZJ90ZgsKUIWUU9XnRu.png","name":"WGBH Boston","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dinosaurs - The Final Day with David Attenborough","video":false,"vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":15}
