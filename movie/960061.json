Soon enough, he is confronted by his greatest fear of all: clowns. As it turns out, the clown - heartbroken and unable to forgive himself after losing love - digs his own grave, convinced that dying is the only way out of his pain and misery. Wise beyond his years, Matt decides to face his fears rather than run away, setting the scene for a life-changing conversation where each becomes a guide of sorts to the other. Both of them find the answers they seek on a journey of personal redemption.  â€”Juan Diego Escobar Alzate","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yycITXzKJ9Berb5dV49Nl4TA4R1.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-11-15","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Sometimes wisdom can be found in the smallest of things, a kid","title":"The Colors of Hope and Wisdom","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
