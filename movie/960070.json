These scenes are spliced together in seemingly random order, sometimes inserted into each other or reshot through close-ups of video monitors. At times the footage is so heavily mediated and re-mediated that images blur into shadow and light, disappear into CRT phosphor dots, or shift hues and patterns from oversaturation and noise. A soundtrack by Hideki Yoshida accompanies the entire sequence, featuring echoing electronic patterns and long tones interspersed with ambient sounds of traffic and beachfront waves. This work was first screened at the Worldwide Video Festival in the Kunstmuseum Den Haag, the Netherlands, in 1986.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4gUV17e9yvYpoXrtzj6TBArzJpC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1985-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Recognition Construction №XIII, Variation’85","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
