It tells the story about the ambiguous relationship between a mother and her daughter. The story involves a midnight adventure through the dark forest, encounters with monsters and a short trip to an erotic dream land. The film is about suppressed female desires, that uncannily return as monstrous doppelgangers within the patriarchal society.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7KDAslKrXoWTudLmUOBPYTjXOYE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tale of Blood","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
