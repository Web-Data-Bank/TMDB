The production revolves around three great French composers who inspired NYCB founder George Balanchine: Charles Gounod, Maurice Ravel and Georges Bizet. The four ballets performed encapsulate Balanchineâ€™s genius and his very own neo-classical style, they also provide a particular insight on the bonds that tied Balanchine to France. What is known today as Walpurgisnacht Ballet was a ballet choreographed for the opera Faust at the Paris Opera in 1975, it premiered as an independent piece in New York in 1980. Sonatine set to a music by Maurice Ravel, was created by two New York City Ballet's French principals, the recently departed Violette Verdy and Jean-Pierre Bonnefoux. La Valse was originally composed by Ravel for the Ballets Russes and Serge Diaghilev, then exiled in France, shortly before Balanchine entered the company. Symphony in C better known as Le Palais de Cristal, premiered at the Paris Opera.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4xRbekWnPNRqUjPBcdzhIlMUr8w.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-05-12","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"New York City Ballet in Paris","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
