She was targeted specifically because she was a proud black lesbian, beloved in her home community of Khayelitsha Township, South Africa, and the latest victim in a national epidemic of homophobic violence. Funeka Soldaat and her activist group Free Gender in Khayelitsha took the police to court, alleging incompetence and corruption in Phelokazi's case. Ndodana-Breen and Greyson have crafted an operatic cine-poem inspired by Phelokazi's story, featuring vocals by mezzo-soprano Chantelle Grant.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/z77uNuy5s9AQBHrWDzNClaKddyt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":180832,"logo_path":null,"name":"Greyzone","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-03","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mariposa","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
