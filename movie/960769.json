Hamka also started writing literature for newspapers and his romance stories were well-liked by readers. Hamka and his family moved to Medan because he was appointed as the editor-in-chief of Pedoman Masyarakat magazine. This position caused Hamka to clash with the Japanese authorities, leading to the magazine being shut down as it was deemed dangerous. The Hamka family's life was also shaken when one of their children died due to illness. Hamka's efforts to approach the Japanese authorities were viewed as being sycophantic and met with hostility, resulting in him being asked to step down from his position as the manager of Muhammadiyah.","popularity":6.123,"poster_path":"/8G1bT9DSxVNX0YU4P5zijvX3pS0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":121036,"logo_path":null,"name":"Majelis Ulama Indonesia","origin_country":""},{"id":72761,"logo_path":"/ikOKXFh7K4Hc9ywiqCI9humBHmg.png","name":"Falcon Pictures","origin_country":"ID"},{"id":14140,"logo_path":"/tYujZw7UWP1mjWv48eqsjutjqeN.png","name":"Starvision Plus","origin_country":"ID"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"2023-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Buya Hamka: Vol. I","video":false,"vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":2}
