Van der Horst turned the recordings into a film titled Practicing which premiered in February and will be shown through August 28, 2022, at De Pont. Practicing is screened adjacent to Dan Graham’s Pavilion, completed for the De Pont museum in 2014. Graham’s work is an especially important touchstone for McBride, and the current installation has provided a unique opportunity to visualize the links between their artistic concerns and to meditate on his recent passing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xbIeYK1twAMugheBgEgHGSFRm5w.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-02-11","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Practicing","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
