And a light air, as if they were stitched together with humming. The film, which was made from images that sprang up rather than being worked out, asks the viewer to be sensitised rather than understood. The happiness and unconcernedness given by the many songs and smiles of the characters may be one of the origins of \"making films because you love them\".","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4IBAEd23PszriusikJO8Sc3y8EH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Would you like to join our dance circle?","title":"Paris Comes When The Flowers Bloom","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
