They arise spontaneously from nowhere, touch themselves one by one as if to confirm the joy of life, and the sight of them moving around with their whole bodies overflowing with the joy of life is irrationally heart-warming. What makes this film even more deeply moving is that it also depicts death, which is the exact opposite of their sense of life and loveliness. The sincerity with which the characters try to accept the death of their beloved companions with all their might goes beyond the realm of character that tends to be described with the word 'cute', and is established as a rich drama. The exhilarating flight scenes and the music, which more than compensates for the dialogue, are also worthy of special mention.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yQfuhN8QTTgmUCQPQDj3jwvwf2f.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"I don't know why I was born, but I know love.","title":"We The Sun At The Centre","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
