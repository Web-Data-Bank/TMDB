The work starts with 'Shaman' and 'Naerimgut (Initiatory Ritual of Shamanism)'. The dancers on the stage are all shamans. The journey of shamans, who are isolated from society due to their special abilities and are reborn through Naerimgut, which soon accepts fate and enters the dance, and shamans who overcome adversity and enter life again, continues beautifully. The title of the work, \"See You, I'm Home\" is a greeting each shaman gives themselves, and a friendly greeting to everyone. The colorful aspects of shamanic culture, a common property of mankind, will fill the theater like a panorama in harmony with intense physical energy, images, and clear music.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/m3cPm17N3HQ809fbgZFxvbZWUHR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-21","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"See You, I'm Home","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
