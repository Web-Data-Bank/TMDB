Perhaps it was the miracle of his survival that gave him the gift of “sight,” and he became a Sangoma, the seer of the Kuvuki tribe, interpreting the wishes of The Great One through the throwing of the bones. Hence his name, “Bones.” Today, at an advanced age but still fit in mind and body, his mission is to pass on his wisdom to his son, Mathambo, and guide him into manhood – a mission doomed to fail because of both of their obsessive personalities.","popularity":3.704,"poster_path":"/9QpdGpGNTKLNm7aOYx2mJM7hI4L.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":173222,"logo_path":null,"name":"Thabede Menzi Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"release_date":"2022-04-14","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Mr. Bones is back and now WITH HIS SON!","title":"Mr. Bones 3: Son of Bones","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":5}
