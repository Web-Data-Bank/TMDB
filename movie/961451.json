The boss agrees to hire the wanderer provided he can ride an unmanageable horse. He consents, rides the horse and gets the job. In accomplishing this \"stunt,\" he arouses the jealousy of the foreman, for the latter learns that the ranchman's daughter has seen the new-comer subdue the wild animal and is beginning to fall in love with him.
