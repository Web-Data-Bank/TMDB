Having been spared from death, he arrogantly attends the crucifixion of the man who took his place. Suddenly he is faced with the power of God and the plaguing question, \"Was Jesus really the Son of God?\" Confident in his unbelief, Barabbas sets out to prove Jesus a fraud. His search for answers reveals many witnesses to the life, ministry, miracles and power of Jesus. Witnesses with facts he cannot dispute.  This powerful animated production confirms that those who seek, often find more than they were searching for...they discover the power of the truth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vO4IBU5CZYqjYbFZxJ3UUWoGSM7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2001-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"The journey to unshakable faith begins with doubt for Barabbas.","title":"The Witness","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
