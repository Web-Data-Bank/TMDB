Miguel left Mexico at a young age, giving up his passion for music and singing. Now he is alone, without family, friends or money. Dalia, the college student, and neighbor, lends more than a sympathetic ear to his anecdotes and reflections; she encourages him to reconnect with friends and family as he faces death.","popularity":0.889,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bye Bye Chicago","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
