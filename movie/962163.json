She multiplies the sentiment in 1+1, by N times maybe, to come up with her debut feature-length fictional film N+N. The wise grandpa and witty granddaughter from 1+1 continue to bless the city with bamboo shoots, while their own home in a rural village is torn down to give way for the high speed railway. They meet other people also jeopardized by the so-called development: artist left homeless because of factory revitalization, the middle-class striving for a living, the young generation born in the 1990s... They are all trying to hold on to the city's collective memory and every living tree.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9B1oaRfhQTaOEvfZv4xKeN3bvU0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":95,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"N+N","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
