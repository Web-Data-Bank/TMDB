Using student films and interviews, Minnesota-based filmmakers Daniel Bergin with Miranda Harincar create a cinematic celebration of education and mentorship.  FITC began as a program offered through the Minneapolis Public Schools, under the umbrella of the Urban Arts Program (whose most notable student might just be Prince). FITC started teaching Super-8 filmmaking and then expanded to include photography and video. Their work not only allowed kids to express themselves cinematically, but they captured stories and images of events and landmarks that would have been forgotten today. Featuring footage shot by FITC students, Film in the Cities: Radical Roots of Youth Media is an eye-opening and inspiring documentary about a little-known aspect of Minnesota history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Film in the Cities: Radical Roots in Youth Media","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
