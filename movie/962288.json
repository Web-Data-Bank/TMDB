As the last big cat surviving in the eastern United States and the state animal of Florida, the panther is an icon of Florida’s ever-diminishing wild places, as revealed in the film’s sumptuous images. Leading a team that includes cowboys, wildlife biologists, photographers/videographers, and a lot of folks who simply care about the future of Florida’s fragile ecology, Ward treks repeatedly into the Everglades and expanses of South Florida to seek, record, and save these ghosts.","popularity":4.607,"poster_path":"/548qM0s0xKFrU793G9dYXaIdwIk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":124376,"logo_path":"/ujxLjV0aT4FOaUjvCe8Bdxx3tvx.png","name":"Grizzly Creek Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":199568,"logo_path":"/bgi0P20VTLfdtgeAQquQl7gLBy7.png","name":"Wildpath","origin_country":"US"},{"id":199569,"logo_path":"/wR1ZvnZH2iedpRA7OKfRUYLYf5e.png","name":"Common Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":562,"logo_path":"/azANEzu3H3Kztzt63sdjvlzxhuB.png","name":"Appian Way","origin_country":"US"},{"id":7521,"logo_path":"/fRqMjLjyAqThtEg9P9WKCXLmCpJ.png","name":"National Geographic","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-04-16","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"Keep the Florida Panther from becoming a ghost","title":"Path of the Panther","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
