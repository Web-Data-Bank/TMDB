Luc, a retired pediatrician and teacher in his eighties, lives with his son François, a pediatrician like his father, and François' wife Esther. Suffering and physically diminished, the old man has now decided to end his life. In a corrosive and sensitive verbal joust, he asks his son to end his days in privacy. The son then takes him on an existential and circus-like journey through the streets of Montreal where the father is supposed to go to his final destination, a hospital where he will be confronted with his ultimate wish: the choice between the finality of medical aid to die or a return to square one, the small pleasures of what remains of his life, alive.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p8R0vLYfAwyOek0ofmUmbavBKv9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":112512,"logo_path":"/wq8znGT8Q3yIK2uzW1L1sjOmvVY.png","name":"Filmoption International","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":35,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dying Alive","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
