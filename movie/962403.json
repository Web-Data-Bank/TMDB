After six years as a slave, Patrick hears the Holy Spirit urging him to make a daring escape from the Irish tribe and the druid priest who controls their ways. Once back home, Patrick first becomes a priest and then a bishop, but all this pales when he makes a stunning announcement: He will return to his kidnappers as a missionary! Find out why the man known as St. Patrick is credited with bringing the Gospel to Ireland in this episode of The Torchlighters.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rCN8pv2i2QzPsoq9IVXI7FCgyho.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Torchlighters: The St. Patrick Story","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
