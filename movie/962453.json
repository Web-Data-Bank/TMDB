They represent Touareg rock, a mix between a sharp BB King and frantic muezzins. It is a cry for uprising, wandering, love, a nomadic blues popular outside Mali's frontiers. It is the new Touareg culture.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Teshumara, les guitares de la rébellion Touareg","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
