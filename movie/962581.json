In a place like Hong Kong these conditions are intensified and magnified by the densely populated living conditions. The pressures of just trying to survive in the big city are already enough to drive people into extreme physical, emotional and mental conditions. These extreme conditions can cause humans to lock-up in every way. In this documentary, \"Finding Bliss: Fire and Ice\", we get a group of well-known but reserved musicians and music students from the bustling streets of Hong Kong and send them halfway around the world to the natural landscapes of Iceland, Fire and Ice.","popularity":0.668,"poster_path":"/ipvemj9Fi5cbeSH0uKTUXz5KMMA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18892,"logo_path":null,"name":"852 Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2022-04-23","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A music and soul tour from Hong Kong to Iceland","title":"Finding Bliss: Fire and Ice","video":false,"vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":1}
