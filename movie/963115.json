They have more than proved their worth through the years - herding, racing, hauling, hunting, rescuing and protecting. Machinery and new technologies have enhanced human life but dogs nonetheless remain a key part of the Arctic survival kit as man's best friend. 'Alaska Dogs' features five Alaskan dog breeds to explore the relationship with man through the history of the forty-ninth State of the USA.
