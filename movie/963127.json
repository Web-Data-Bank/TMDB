The second episode, \"Estrellita Va a New York\" (\"Estrellita Goes to New York\"), is inspired by a comics story by Carlos Ceesepe, and tells the escape to the United States of little Estrellita and her friend Katia who, helped by Pablo Picasso, try to escape from Paris occupied by the Nazis. The third segment, \"Due Dongiovanni\", is an original subject by Mario Martone and Giorgio Barberio Corsetti, freely inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's movie Saboteur (1942).
