Calzaghe was sensational, with the bewildering hand speed that is his trademark, sending his confused and battered rival into retreat. Lacy, who arrived with the most fearsome reputation, was too busy defending himself to throw much back. The Welshman won every round, connecting, incredibly, with over one thousand punches! Promoter Frank Warren had billed the fight as 'Judgement Day' and after this sublime boxing masterclass the judgement is surely that all-conquering Calzaghe is one of Britain's best ever.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rI9IwqvZRwphZzpus40MupRwfWt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-03-04","revenue":0,"runtime":73,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Calzaghe vs. Lacy","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
