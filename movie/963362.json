The discovery triggers a phantom to roam the marshlands, with an insatiable hunger. In its path lies Carona, a sleepy village of Catholics and Hindus, living on small pleasures of the past. The phantom sets its sight on Ravio, a weary bakery-worker mocked for being 'slow in the head'. On his morning round Ravio gets increasingly lost and desperate, and is ultimately consumed by the phantom. Ravio returns to the village that night, albeit in a vengeful form, leading to dire consequences for the village. Six months later the archaeologist who made the discovery, roams around Carona inquiring about the deaths and disappearances that happened here after his discovery. He tracks Ravio's steps from that fateful day and it leads him to a grove where the reincarnated phantom is resting.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mpZWaus0GQBtnfmcY3XCzK7GMWF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Today Me, Tomorrow You","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
