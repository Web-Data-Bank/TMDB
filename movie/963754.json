All hope seems to be lost for Fanny, but her luck turns when she’s hired as a cigar roller at a cigar shop – or that’s what she thinks. It quickly transpires that the “cigar shop” is merely a cover for shadier affairs. Together with “Piphans” and other bandits, Fanny has to roll something completely different than cigars.
