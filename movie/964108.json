Bajo el Tacaná uses the migrant´s testimonies and first-hand accounts from bystanders, such as a taxi driver in Tapachula and a doctor who tends the prostitutes to chronicle the atrocities that take place in the Mexico- Guatemala border. Voice-over adds meaning to the film, while the music conveys what we couldn´t or wouldn´t dare to record on video.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":26,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bajo el Tacaná","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
