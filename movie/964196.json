The soft focus of the live photography--as in a half-grown dog running all-out against a background of fields and fences--and the pleasing patterns of abstract designs combine with the relaxed mood of the ballad to produce an agreeable interlude of sights and sounds.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Half-masted Schooner","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
