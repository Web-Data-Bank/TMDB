Their priests are called daba. Among the few old shamans who are still living today, Dafa Luzo is the most remarkable. As the main character in the film, we see him looking after his farm and his family, as well as performing rituals to expel all unclean spirits and demons and honour the ancestors. His main worry, and his greatest hope, is to make sure his knowledge is safely handed down to the next generation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"}],"release_date":"1999-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Daba - Portrait of a Na Shaman","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
