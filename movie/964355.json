In 2013, the law on Marriage for All is voted in turn, allowing access to marriage and parenthood for homosexual couples. In 2021, the law on PMA for all, so that homosexual women are no longer discriminated against in access to maternity, is still being debated while deputies and senators are opposed on many articles of the text. More than twenty years separate these three laws, the fruit of three decades of struggle by activists and associations, women and men politicians. From the ravages of AIDS, the first motor of these struggles, to the agitated parliamentary debates around the Pacs, through the demonstrations of the Manif pour tous, this documentary, illustrated with archival images, gives the floor to the actors to retrace the stages, sometimes forgotten, of this history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tLHf8CofjSOJrAKHb4S5XfF2JOX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-11-10","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Du PACS à la PMA, trente ans de combats pour l’égalité des droits","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
