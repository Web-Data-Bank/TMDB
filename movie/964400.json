The sculpture was commissioned by Cathedraltown’s developer, and donated to the City of Markham as a public art piece. The residents, however, quickly rose in opposition to a sculpture that they felt did not represent them, and negatively affected their quiet suburban community.  Charity is presented as a public digital artwork produced by the National Film Board of Canada in partnership with Museum of Contemporary Art, Toronto. The interactive documentary employs 360° video and photogrammetry to share a variation on the familiar interactive real estate tour –– where a house in Cathedraltown becomes a site to collect and re-narrate a community’s confrontation with a piece of public art, in turn offering a portrait of private property.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Charity","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
