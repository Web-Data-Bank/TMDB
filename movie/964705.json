This is the question the multi-talented composer Flint Juventino Beppe – formerly known as Fred Jonny Berg – has set out to answer. The album Remote Galaxy is a journey in time and space, a journey given meaning by the album's music and philosophy. The music is uncompromisingly honest, with a genuine power of its own. Using well-known acoustic technology, the composer takes us to some unusual and, for most of us, unknown places.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xze9UInIzJDtuCMIeefvFrGUUpq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"2L 100 - Philharmonia Orchestra r- Remote Galaxy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
