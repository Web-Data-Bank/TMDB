This territory, developed by myself, Bryan Morello, and Matthew Endler, is a three story physical structure built at the threshold of our shared studio. This building is a set, a laboratory, and a place for us to play, experiment, research, and generate ideas. It is a place for creative overlap as well as individual development. This video found its form as the camera pushed through space, encountering its limits, detecting its surroundings, and recording our traces...How do we find our bodies in this place? And what actions do we take there? How does a narrative gather and disperse?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iYIfJIj9EnakCOgGCMXleiCxIRS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-09-24","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Engine Complex: Bridge/Seed","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
