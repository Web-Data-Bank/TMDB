Although a young man Aubry knows Ruthwen is a vampire, he is sworn to secrecy. When the young man’s own lover Malwina is about to become the vampire’s next victim, Aubry has to choose between saving his bride or remaining true to his oath.  Der Vampyr is by a formative figure in Hanover's musical life; the composer Heinrich Marschner led the theatre that preceded the Staatsoper, as Royal Hanoverian Kapellmeister and Intendant, for almost three decades from 1831. Marschner adapted John Polidori's novella ‘The Vampyre’, which was modelled on British dandy and writer Lord Byron. Our fascination with the bloodsucking outsider is still as strong two centuries later. Brilliant German director Ersan Mondtag and his team explore social outsiderness and the curse of immortality.","popularity":0.634,"poster_path":"/sQeiOuHn4Eh1wLnak492tJ2m7v9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-03-25","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Der Vampyr - MARSCHNER","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
