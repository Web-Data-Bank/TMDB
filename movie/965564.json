Is he the ‘pure fool, enlightened by compassion’, who, it has been prophesied, will purify the realm?  In his final music drama Parsifal, Wagner fashions the fear of the temptations and sinful desires into a tale of redemption. The score contrasts the sacred with the sensual, from the stark magnificence of the music for the procession to the Grail Hall in Act I to the richly orchestrated scene in which Kundry attempts to seduce Parsifal in Act II. There are sections of almost unearthly beauty such as the Act I Prologue and the closing scene of the opera, in which Parsifal reveals the Grail to the knights. OperaVision viewers discover András Almási-Tóth’s new production conducted by Balázs Kocsár live at its premiere on Good Friday at Hungarian State Opera.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dxI7ATTKE44SUuPrMtYTCGdrLnq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Parsifal - HSO","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
