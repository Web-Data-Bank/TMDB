Spanning over a course of seven years this film follows one strangely fascinating person's struggle to find the true meaning of life. Terrified by the possibility that she would die in anonymity she takes her costumes, dance and ideas on the road. Her story lends perspective to the unlimited potential in people of differing abilities and ultimately tells a tale about the resilience of the human spirit. Intimate interviews with Suzanne and people who know her, her performances and childhood memories are woven into a tapestry that creates frank, open and honest portrait of a real person.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"My Life as an Underdog","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
