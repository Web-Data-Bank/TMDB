It explores his photography, his relationship to the downtown New York art world, and the gay S&M club scene prevalent in the eighties. His infamously explicit pictures of the gay, leather, New York Underground were considered groundbreaking and made him a cause celebre. Mapplethorpeâ€™s portraits, flowers, erotic subject matter and artistic presentation, elevated the photograph to serious art, worthy of exhibition in galleries and museums.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1w87JkMHw5YIxSgEzEz2pbMclcf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-09-15","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Program No. 61: Robert Mapplethorpe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
