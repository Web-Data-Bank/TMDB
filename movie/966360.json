After kidnapping and robbing a man, two lovers - Sweetie and Rose - keep him captive in his bed. When Rose leaves, Sweetie is left alone with the prisoner, where she begins to project a twisted metaphysical bond. Exceedingly atmospheric, Fält’s film stars two NoBudge regulars, Kate Adams and Anna Cordell, in performances brimming with intensity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bandits","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
