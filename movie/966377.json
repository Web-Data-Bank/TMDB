I was attempting to distill the elements of film to a pure state by stripping away any meaning from the images, to explore film as simply the masking and filtering of light. For subject matter I shot things which had, at one time or another, struck a chord within me. In doing so, I realized that I was also creating a catalogue of my own memories. I have always seen memories as discreet units of light, not unlike books on a shelf... \"BOOKCASE\" became not only an experiment in \"pure\" film, but a reflection on the concept of memory as well. In the convergence of these two ideas, light is the common basic element.
