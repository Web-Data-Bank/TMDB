Four Czech pilgrimage stories also inspired a new pilgrim, who has just embarked on his long journey. He steps out of his comfort zone to not only discover the magic of the pilgrimage, but also to find himself. When a pilgrim meets a pilgrim on the way to Santiago de Compostela, their first question is clear: “Where are you coming from?” Because every step counts. This is evidenced by four pilgrims’ stories: Kvakin, who came from Boskovice; Olga, who managed her own pilgrimage at an older age; Mario, whose journey summoned him on its own accord; and Peter, who was paralyzed in half his body but got up from his wheelchair and hit the road. We also follow the pilgrimage of Kamil Bartošek, better known as the entertainer and mystifier Kazma Kazmitch.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xfnDRuIcK3wfo2XJKn2TD178yPg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":487,"logo_path":"/x3BUIowxU2skXOpnOeOkl7kIYDo.png","name":"Česká televize","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":127477,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bumerang.film","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2022-04-17","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Step By Step","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
