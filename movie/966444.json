Two flashlights are strapped to my ankles and the other to one wrist. I begin throwing the tree knives at 20 feet away from the panel and move toward the panel at 2 foot intervals, throwing the set of knives to 10 feet from the surface and then move back to the 20 ft. mark. The lights in the room are dimmed a specific amount at each interval until the room is totally dark revealing only light specks given by the flashlights reflecting off the broken surface of the panel. The soundtrack consists of the knives striking the surface and sometimes bouncing to the floor; a woman's voice is heard speaking: 'stick, bounce, stick, stick, bounce' etc., as each knife is thrown.\" - David Askevold","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hc7SOq45z8hBX1z6CtbYe1v5zcp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1969-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Knife Throw","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
