He built a second one in 1905. He shot more than 500 films there until 1913. In 1904, Charles Pathé built a studio a few hundred meters from there, which completed the installations in Vincennes; in 1909, he sold it to the famous producer Zecca. Later, Max Linder also came to work at the Montreuil studio. In 1920, Pathé gave up film production and sold his studio to Russian exiled filmmakers: Ermolieff, then to Alexandre Kamenka. They were among the most active producers of the 1920s. With great actors like Mosjoukine and a remarkable technical team, Kamenka was to launch such important filmmakers as Volkoff, René Clair, Jean Epstein, Jacques Feyder and Marcel L'Herbier.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cYzKQFkAUayTRAzECs2TKvEu4kl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-11-22","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Le cinéma des pêches","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
