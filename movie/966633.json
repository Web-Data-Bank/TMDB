This is the question the film tries to answer by addressing them directly through a voice-over. In a mosaic of fiction and animation sequences, film excerpts, \"smartphone\" shots and a considerable amount of archive material, the film restores entire sections of our History and our current events, by looking back at some of the major political and social achievements that young people often ignore. \"Letter to the child you gave us\" aims at inciting them to measure the importance of laws, the stake of democracy, and to push them to the commitment until fighting abstention.","popularity":0.64,"poster_path":"/j5OmEYTF1DqdRFiyPmn01T1TMw7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-05-11","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lettre à l'enfant que tu nous as donné","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
