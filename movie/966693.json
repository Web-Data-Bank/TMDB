Her teenager students and colleagues at graduate school say that the reason she fails in every blind date is because of her appearance. They say even though she was not born with a pretty appearance, she has never made enough effort to make herself up. In order to have the so-called 'feminine appearanceâ€™ she tries to lose weight. However she fails again on a blind date. She started these things in hopes that her loneliness would decrease if she was loved by someone. But rather she finds out that she was getting further apart from herself. What went wrong? In order to find the answer to this, she turns the camera to herself. She begins to make an experiment to observe the society, the neighborhoods, and herself by wearing the costume of femininity our society expects. What conclusion will this experiment lead to?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vMLAsOp3BZAiDd9Fjd7GRA7kCqj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Areum","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
