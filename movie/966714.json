The winding serpentine roads curling along a green mountain like lazy laces. Perhaps the ideal place for a game of black, white and grey. A writer comes to Kolkakham with his trophy wife for a holiday. In a most unexpected place he is run down by a car and goes into coma. He wakes up in a hospital after 3 days to an inspector questioning his identity. The only things he remembers are his name Samrat Ray, his wife's name Sayani and the hotel they are staying at. Inspector Chettri takes him to his wife who refuses to recognize him. Instead she introduces them to her husband and their friends. Now begins a perfect mind game to solve a riddle that keeps taking the protagonist to people and places where he keeps getting trapped in the intrigues of lies, deceit and betrayal.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nUvBFbMEOsnq5IAaK5f2uSKGZE0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-11-21","revenue":0,"runtime":151,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Shaada Kalo Aabcha","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
