People you once called friend or ally now mercilessly hunt you down in the street. Survive DC follows four teams as they participate in a one-of-a-kind footrace through the streets of our nation's capitol. They run, hide, strategize, and con their way through the 15-mile, five-hour game, trying to avoid being infected by other players. Some participants come dressed as superheroes, villains, and zombies and have trained all year for the event. The race is free of charge, totally open-source, and very illegal.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9iTVDIMlMYQxEZnNjXpagnf1Y6d.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":174064,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dreamscape Media, LLC","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Survive DC is a race for your life.","title":"Survive DC","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
