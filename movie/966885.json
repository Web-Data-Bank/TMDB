She has long wanted to make a film that brings together people from across Wales to share their experiences of what it means to be black and Welsh. Now she has done just that. Weaving together a collection of engaging stories, she meets people from Newport in the south to Snowdonia in the north, and from a 19-year-old model storming to international runway success to a 92-year-old whose arrival in Wales predates the Empire Windrush.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7UpZWDeVz2CXBZNYVKvhUagABkZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2020-10-04","revenue":0,"runtime":29,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Welsh","iso_639_1":"cy","name":"Cymraeg"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Black & Welsh","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
