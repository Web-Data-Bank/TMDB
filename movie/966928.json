A group of thirty-year-olds no longer accept that the solution to the economic, ecological and political problems of the territory is always \"to leave\". They propose to the villagers who own pieces of uncultivated land, often felt as a burden, to put them in common. They decide to stay, to link their lives to the land and to invest in a value: being together. Castiglione becomes the village of restance. They cultivate ancient seeds and local biodiversity, they make decisions together, they develop a local economy. Accepting the shadows of the past, another potential of the place is rediscovered.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":139172,"logo_path":null,"name":"Atelier Graphoui","origin_country":""},{"id":134802,"logo_path":null,"name":"Own Air","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2021-11-27","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La restanza","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
