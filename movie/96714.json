Anti-globalization activists clashed with the police, with 23-year-old protester Carlo Giuliani shot dead after confronting a police vehicle. In the aftermath, the police organized a night raid on the Diaz high school, where around a hundred people between unarmed protesters—mostly students—and independent reporters who documented the police brutality during the protests had took shelter. What happened next was called by Amnesty International \"the most serious breach of civil liberties in a democratic Western country since World War II.\"","popularity":4.541,"poster_path":"/vcGFlMHToPdYLn3ZMUwHsA8FQr0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2441,"logo_path":"/7Vutdea75apwXkRyfQ4Ne6j0KcN.png","name":"Fandango","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":5125,"logo_path":"/t3oWTsVukmEzrZzvfr37XRBibo5.png","name":"Le Pacte","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":20655,"logo_path":"/kbJVVP3nKf5YEPIeZ9P0hP1gaQu.png","name":"A Plus Image 3","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":20647,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studioul de Creatie Cinematografica al Ministerului Culturii","origin_country":"RO"},{"id":13407,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mandragora","origin_country":"RO"},{"id":14016,"logo_path":"/snclwsIZQbgvqYCBJP8fqNlCA5y.png","name":"MiC","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":20648,"logo_path":"/lh17Uva8X5wPYZSBKh7CYXqlmFF.png","name":"BNL - Gruppo BNP Paribas","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":197649,"logo_path":null,"name":"IDM Südtirol - Alto Adige Film Fund","origin_country":""},{"id":20645,"logo_path":null,"name":"Provincia Autonoma di Bolzano","origin_country":""},{"id":20416,"logo_path":"/jTXzZRiKZt7L4YvVW4DGvqU51RU.png","name":"Regione Lazio","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"2012-04-13","revenue":1800000,"runtime":127,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Diaz - Don't Clean Up This Blood","video":false,"vote_average":7.176,"vote_count":398}
