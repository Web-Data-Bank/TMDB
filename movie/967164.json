But when Renee leaves town to play a concert date, Don meets up with journalist Anna Falkner (Amy Fisher) for an interview that leads to an explosive one night stand. When the increasingly needy Anna shows signs of mental instability, Don tries to pull away from the tempestuous brunette and return to his normal life. But a furious Anna won't be ignored, and Don soon finds that he's in over his head and there may be no way out.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cs5uujp5u3x9UKzL3OCaIelggt8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":154032,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sweet Sinema","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-09-13","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"When love becomes obsession","title":"Fatal Seduction","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
