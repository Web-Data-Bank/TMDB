Lowe Railroad. It was produced by  Philip Callahan's Galway Productions. Callahan was an amateur historian who presented slide shows about Mt. Lowe. They proved to be so impressive that Southern California Edison funded a film version as a public service. As the documentary shows, at the turn of the 20th Century a \"railroad to the stars\" ran from Pasadena to Mt. Wilson by way of Pacific Electric Red Car, incline cable car / funicular, and electric trolley. Today, this engineering wonder is gone, although traces still exist in the San Gabriels. The film consists primarily of black and white motion pictures and (color tinted) stills. Narrated by Lynn Adkins.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fZt6S3IDRM08oDbVzsbO3acJBJd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":174165,"logo_path":null,"name":"Southern California Edison Company","origin_country":""},{"id":174167,"logo_path":null,"name":"Galway Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":32,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"PASADENA & MT.
