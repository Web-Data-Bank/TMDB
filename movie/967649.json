Based on a childhood memory, the experimental short film spans from the Cold War Iron Curtain, to the so-called “refugee crisis” and the renewed closing of borders during COVID-19. Textures of walls closing in, blur with pixelated maps, creating a subjective portrait of a new reality and its digital image-world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/atwwdpoyP0nTjdTYT3Z8In8jwDl.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The world is blue at its edges","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
