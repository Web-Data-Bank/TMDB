The artist herself reads \"Holzschnitt\", or woodcut, rather as \"Höllenszene\", a scene of Hell – perhaps because it appears as if animate nature is trying to force the giant to the ground. Gradually emerging from blurriness in the film, the hero defies fate – at least initially. In so doing, he sets the agenda for Gröller´s figures: Rust is about delaying the deterioration that comes with time. Three so-called \"best agers\" act according to the saying, \"If you rest, you rust,\" training their muscles, stretching their fascia, staying on the move.
