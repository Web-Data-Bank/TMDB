The white DJ was an early adopter of hip hop in the 1980s and presented BBC Radio 1’s Rap Show for almost 20 years, before moving to Capital Xtra in 2013. The self-styled ‘Big Dawg’ had everyone from Jay-Z to Nicki Minaj on his shows, and his stint presenting MTV’s Pimp My Ride made him a household name.  In a joint investigation by the BBC and The Guardian, allegations of sexual misconduct have been brought to light. In this explosive documentary, six women speak out about their experiences for the first time, claiming he misused his powerful position in the music industry to take advantage of them.","popularity":0.888,"poster_path":"/qX6wkNlhkO8f8ep1pZ67AZadNUx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-04-26","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tim Westwood: Abuse of Power","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
