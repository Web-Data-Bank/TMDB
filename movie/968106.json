They believe that when their loved ones die, they move on into another life -- and the Ga make sure they do so in style. They honor their dead with brightly colored coffins that celebrate the way they lived. The shape of the coffin gives the onlooker the feeling of having known the one who has just left this world or to recognize someone who had the same passion as him, the same dream ... or to allow a professional corporation to pay tribute to a brother who has just passed away. The popularity of the coffins of Ga, which normally all end up underground, have now found a place in museums outside the continent.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ghana, Coffins to Order","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
