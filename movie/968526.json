Following strategies of structural film making, 16mm plays with the footage roll used to film it as constitutive base of its form and content. A 16 mm film standard roll of 200 feet (60.96 meters) gives an approximate duration of 5' 33\" (333\"). That means 1 meter of film is consumed every 5.46 seconds or 18.3 cm. every second.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/v2SyfboPagEgnyzumcmrR82G9NY.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"16mm","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
