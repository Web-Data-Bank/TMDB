Along with director Frank Zichem, he departs for Ghana, where he is informed about how and where the slave trade took place. Breeveld is visibly moved upon seeing the dank dungeons and the 'door of no return' at Cape Coast Castle. The encounter with the 'key bearer' of the mighty Ashanti king is not a dispassionate event, either. At Fort Elmina, they meet the Ghanaian Stephen Korsah, who knows a lot about the history of slavery in his native country and Europe, but nothing about final destination Suriname. The road movie gets a sequel when Korsah travels along to Suriname. In the interior, he is greeted in Kromanti, the language from his native region. Now, even the tough Korsah is touched. The wounds of slavery are far from healed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Katibo Ye Ye","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
