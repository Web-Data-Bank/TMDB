At 8:34 a.m., the attack took place. Herrhausen, a top manager with threat level one, was killed instantly. Near the scene of the crime: paper with RAF emblem. Hidden in the bushes: the detonating mechanism of a bomb. An unprecedented, technically sophisticated attack. To this day, the case raises questions: Who were the perpetrators? Why was Herrhausen targeted?
