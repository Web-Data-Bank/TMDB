The comedy The Teenager premiered on October 16 last year at the Gaflar Theatre and was a huge hit, albeit particularly entertaining in every way. This summer Arnór and Óli Gunnar have since set up the work in many places, e.g. in Norway, where it was very well received. The play also received very good reviews from critics, saying, for example, Silja Aðalsteinsdóttir in her review that they were \"geniuses\" arnór and Óli Gunnar who \"know exactly what they are talking about when describing the teenager's life.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4xGlbKNro0B4oIRMZi9hPQmMA4m.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":110,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Unglingurinn","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
