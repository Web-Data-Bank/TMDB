Actually, something like this doesn't happen. It took many preliminary talks and several attempts before Jan P. actually sat down in front of the camera. For 10 years in the 1990s, he spied on the left-wing autonomous scene in Wuppertal and Solingen and betrayed his friends to the Office for the Protection of the Constitution. Afterwards, he kept quiet about his double life for 20 years. His original aim was to protect the state. Today, however, his doubts about having been a stooge for the wrong cause prevail. STRG_F reporter Felix met Jan P. and asks himself: What does such a double life do to people - to the traitor and the betrayed?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2022-04-19","revenue":0,"runtime":31,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"V-man unpacks: 10 years of friends spied on","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
