Alongside them were Jóhann Páll Valdimarsson, publisher and the Cadillac expert Steini í Svissinum. The trip gave them the inspiration to write a book about the trip which came out in the fall of 2006. Alot happened on this trip and the publisher Jóhann Páll wanted to write a book with the title: How to survive a mad trip with four insane guys. The book could be used for teaching in psychiatric studies.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uuu4taLwXDJEIEwajQcgl2YlBAp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-05-26","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Icelandic","iso_639_1":"is","name":"Íslenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Úti að aka - Á reykspúandi kadilakk yfir Ameríku","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
