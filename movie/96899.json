Other top entertainers lend their voices to the tape: Tony Bennett sings the story of \"Hit the Road to Dreamland\"; Lauryn Hill brings rhythm to \"Hush, Little Baby\"; Billy Crystal lends many voices to Mercer Mayer's \"There's a Nightmare in My Closet\"; and singers Natalie Cole, Aaron Neville, and Patti LeBelle sing other tales. A dandy video for the youngster, punctuated with \"interviews\" of real kids answering a host of bedtime questions.","popularity":1.162,"poster_path":"/yYQ9UiFwEqyP2Pl6w2FCLWmSeut.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3268,"logo_path":"/tuomPhY2UtuPTqqFnKMVHvSb724.png","name":"HBO","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1999-07-15","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Goodnight Moon & Other Sleepytime Tales","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
