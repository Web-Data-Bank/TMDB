Will he find the love of a faithful woman to break the curse?  Richard Wagner came across the legend of The Flying Dutchman in 1838 through Heinrich Heine’s From the Memoirs of Herr von Schnabelewopski. After a stormy voyage from Riga to London – Wagner was again on the run from creditors – he chose the material for his next opera and began to compose it, with the unpredictable power of the sea still fresh on his face. Against the backdrop of this wild nature, Wagner exposes in Holländer his utopia of a love that transcends, offered as an antidote to the 19th century zeitgeist of pounding industrialisation and economic growth. Roger Vontobel’s new production from Mannheim is streamed live on the opening night and audiences around the world can share in some of the most rousing music written in opera.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nGkRa4LhaSKwLO66njwPCE6QbzC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-24","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Flying Dutchman - MANNHEIM","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
