In summertime, their daily ritual is to swim down the river that flows through their home town. As the current carries them down the river, they meditate on friendship, love, and becoming older. What will it be like to have to live without one's partner after three decades together? They ponder the unthinkable: what will either of them do if the other passes away? Their lives are so interwoven after decades together that it's hard to imagine. We see them both literally and figuratively floating down the river of life together in this moving short documentary.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5MQCSMYdUyCcCQVdly3R1cBdRMK.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-10-31","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Downstream","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
