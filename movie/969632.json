The film follows Efiaimbelo as he travels to an isolated area in the countryside to cut down a special tree for sculpting. He makes it into a pole of geometric shapes, which he then tops with a finely honed sculpture of a cow. This beautiful sculpture is funerary piece, designed to ornament a grave. The film features remarkable footage of huge tombs covered with cow antlers and poles like the one we see Efiaimbelo sculpt. The tops of these poles are decorated with all sorts of animals, people and tableaux associated with the dead person. Very little has been known or seen of this funereal and artistic tradition outside the region and the film provides an extraordinarily rich visual experience.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xckG8oZWCr80zGB7WPRJ2uBF2LN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1990-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Young Man's Dream and a Woman's Secret","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
