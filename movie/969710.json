In reviewing the footage afterwards, we discovered that the most memorable events were the interactions of the children with the off-camera adults. We therefore put together a tape that illustrates children's fragile and often stubborn re-interpretation of what adults expect of them. The tape is embroidered with vignettes (filmed on Super-8 as home-movies) of the same children at play.\" -B.A.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":16,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Talk, Kids","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
