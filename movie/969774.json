Indeed, during the Second World War, most of the Resistance networks had been infiltrated by traitors, the \"V Man\" (trusted men) in the service of the occupier. The Germans had established treason as a system and recruiting Frenchmen ready to inform on them was one of their priorities. It was these Frenchmen, whose number is estimated at between 20,000 and 30,000, who dealt terrible blows to the Resistance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kwGo3CxsQNVEEuLiMqOs3LFoMsW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20442,"logo_path":"/bJdNEHt2r5D3hVolSLN9UP1azi0.png","name":"Morgane Production","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":127436,"logo_path":"/85hn0WZVj2wpm7scTkrQz76lKJ7.png","name":"LCP - Assemblée nationale","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/eLvjHPYZ12GR58lrDgg6MXZp2a3.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":151018,"logo_path":"/9w5fZX47lnO75WLpoYj1Fdrc0zy.png","name":"Ministère des Armées","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2021-11-18","revenue":0,"runtime":60,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Des traîtres dans la Résistance","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
