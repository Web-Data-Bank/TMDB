They have sex. Someone watches. Janine makes a run for it, to a plane headed anywhere... until the jet does an 'emergency,' landing in a small town. There's only one small problem: The crew looks remarkably like the one she left behind. And someone still watches. With a gun. Join adult's top director Paul Thomas and megastar Janine, in a trip thru time zones and time, where everybody's somebody and nobody's who they seem. Except Janine. Who's always hot. Layover, now boarding.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/z9P1mmn5HYT7z0Uqo1eUgFVsFoB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5979,"logo_path":"/xjEVAzZSK95vbf3gRQ4APTPy2JX.png","name":"Vivid Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1994-12-16","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Layover","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
