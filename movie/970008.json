Terrorists, gunmen and mafia bosses are serving their life sentences in the Russian penal camp \"Vologodski Pjatak\". The fortress on the island of Ognenny was built as a monastery in the 16th century. Later the \"Fire Island\" was converted into a gulag for enemies of the state after the October Revolution of 1917. Since 1994 it is a maximum security prison for serious criminals. Christoph Wanner is the first western TV reporter to manage to shoot behind the prison walls on the island of the damned.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/k5eT1k6yFKPQoizkux5VLT1xttt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":138741,"logo_path":null,"name":"WELT","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2020-08-23","revenue":0,"runtime":50,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Russia's Alcatraz- The toughest prison on Fire Island","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
