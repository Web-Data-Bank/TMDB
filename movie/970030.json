Composed of two acts and a requiem, Miller’s tragedy follows Willy Loman, the titular salesman in a morality play about the so-called American Dream and the dissatisfactions of capitalism. Instead of simply using Miller’s language, Williams collaged a script that also includes texts by Albert Einstein, Saidiya Hartman, Yvonne Rainer, and others. A single actor performs passages from the script as imagery from pop, political, and journalistic sources appears. Williams’s Loman character appears as both actor and dancer, accentuating the emphasis placed on the monologue and solo in theater and dance, respectively. She has reflected, “the work reconfigures the historical record to reflect the unnamable narratives of the psyche, emphasizing the Black body as a site of experience at the same time that it is coopted as a politicized symbol by the spectator.”","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tPeC6I1tNn0kzRxz1U0SNEuKDzf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Death of A","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
