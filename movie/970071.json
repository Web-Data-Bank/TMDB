He picks dates, waits on tourists at an eco resort (where his mother also works), tends horses at a local ranch and runs errands for anyone willing to pay. While the lure of Tehran seduces some of his friends away, Ebrahim, for all the daily hardships and demands, seems content to stick close to home. Through Ebrahim’s eyes, wise beyond their years, writer-director Mehdi Hoseinivand explores the rhythms and relationships of small town life in largely realist terms but at the film’s center is always a warm, caring story of Ebrahim and his family as they quietly, determinedly make their way in the world.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":77,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Asteroid","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
