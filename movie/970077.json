One of the many peaceful protests following Floyd’s death took place in Washington, D.C.’s Lafayette Square, near the White House. In order to facilitate a photo op for former President Donald Trump raising a Bible in front of St. John’s Episcopal Church adjacent to Lafayette Square, U.S. Attorney General William Barr ordered federal forces to clear the area. They subsequently fired on the peaceful protestors with tear gas, stun grenades, and rubber bullets. They also flew two helicopters so low to the ground that the wind created by their rotors broke tree branches and scattered debris.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iGYEsdO9Xxwn8yz99KsptPejzNs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"06.01.2020 18.39","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
