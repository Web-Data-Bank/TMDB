Their families are ashamed, the funeral takes place in secret, and on the tomb appears the name the deceased had before their transition, in one stroke nullifying the entire life path they had chosen. The same thing happened to Antonia. Her girlfriends gather to honor her memory and give her back her identity denied. In telling her story, the filmâ€™s stars, all drawn from the variegated transgender world, interweave the narrative with tales of their own lives, experiences, and memories.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/i8YQB0PkRrse47TMpG1C5toaALc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":43244,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stemal Entertainment","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":76921,"logo_path":"/dkPpGhEL2uQ5bmNDAqSZRFp894g.png","name":"Les Films d'ici","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":155990,"logo_path":"/py9VaywwK6KVi94YwrxSKVg1gkh.png","name":"RAI Cinema","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":26261,"logo_path":"/thn5VXJ5JegdrtiJn7mFuV2NWB6.png","name":"Film Commission Torino Piemonte","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":141573,"logo_path":null,"name":"Emilia-Romagna Film Commission","origin_country":""},{"id":80296,"logo_path":null,"name":"Europictures","origin_country":""},{"id":115535,"logo_path":"/mYoc1K3UPAUqKfuCYkvDLJN2aAA.png","name":"Vision Distribution","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"2022-09-05","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Fabulous Ones","video":false,"vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3}
