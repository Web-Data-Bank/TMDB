Not only is it the last pub standing, but it’s also the only remaining public space where people can meet in a once-thriving mining community that has seen thirty hard years of decline. TJ Ballantyne, the landlord, hangs on to The Old Oak by his fingertips, and his predicament is endangered even more when the pub becomes contested territory after the arrival of Syrian refugees who are placed in the village without any notice. In an unlikely friendship, TJ meets a curious young Syrian woman, Yara, who has a camera. Can they find a way for the two communities to understand each other? So unfolds a deeply moving drama about their fragilities and hopes.","popularity":3.736,"poster_path":"/zrLQ49x3DgeUTW3NPc7uDdMj2TB.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12695,"logo_path":"/pZg9WqHoiUqhCzoMwGTcPI6Bs3d.png","name":"Sixteen Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":729,"logo_path":"/hNxGdbddbsDDnEWJ7RNLcGCRSLQ.png","name":"Why Not Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":113521,"logo_path":"/fF4xLqMQ0C6Laql7HpzRnvn8hfi.png","name":"StudioCanal","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":288,"logo_path":"/aW0IpM9d4Zjj978EqgDVSxXXhTj.png","name":"BBC Film","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":1926,"logo_path":"/sORCydQs61kwWqRIIzPiBpgVVag.png","name":"Les Films du Fleuve","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2023-09-29","revenue":0,"runtime":113,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Old Oak","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
