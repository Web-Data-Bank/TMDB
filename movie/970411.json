Influenced by Kafka's \"The Metamorphosis\" and Aileen Wuornos, a Florida prostitute and lesbian who was sentenced to death row for killing several tricks, this video explores homophobia from a different and extreme angle. Here, the protagonist morphs from someone engaging in bestiality to cannibalism. The object of her desire is what she aspires to; her tragedy is that her metamorphosis destroys not only her mate, but also her former self.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/o6wXL40SfnQBVPoSDcJuMF5wVjg.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ent-homo-philia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
