The film imagines the traumatised body as a functioning time machine where gaps between timelines and anomalies cause the present-day body to disappear and is replaced by the bodyâ€™s memory of past trauma. The film weaves a narrative from mental time travel, episodic future thinking (a projection of the self into the future to pre-experience an event) and PTSD.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-08-30","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dissolving Beyond the Worm Moon","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
