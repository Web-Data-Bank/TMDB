Five women are shown with their daily burdens and one can easily guess how heavy the burdens are. All five represent the African woman collapsing under Africa’s weight. This film could also bear the title \" The Cry\": The distress cry of women who are legion, and whose cause the author, thanks to the magic of cinema, wants to defend, even with the most cold-hearted. When he decided to show five women’s every-day lives, Mr Idriss Diabete, who promised to tell the truth, nothing but the truth, had no idea of the danger threatening him. Is with women temptation always present ? He gave in to it and has eventually offered us beauty.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/pcwDtKygdXWJMEt8bVGfVjZ12Tq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BF","name":"Burkina Faso"},{"iso_3166_1":"CI","name":"Cote D'Ivoire"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2009-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"La femme porte l'Afrique","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
