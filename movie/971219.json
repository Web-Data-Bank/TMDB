War shaped the body of my mother, and her features in mine, continue to incite jokes about sexual violence. The connection between immigration and the countries whose infrastructures, economies and environments were ruined by US presence remains unseen. My family survived by hiding these atrocities from the children they raised in the US, genuinely wanting to protect us from the past. But keeping them hidden lets the violence survive too.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3svJa5d57FTHbbTcoRxroaBliO3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-05-04","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Survives by Hiding","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
