Tucholsky was a left-wing democrat of Jewish heritage, a pacifist and antimilitarist who lived in exile in Sweden between 1932 and 1935. In letters written to his friends Hedvig Muller and Walter Hasenclever, he warns of anti-democratic tendencies in politics, the military and the judicial system in Sweden as well as in Germany and the rest of Europe, but also of the current threat of Nazism. With unconventional austerity, slow travelling shots of details and empty rooms, (a form recognized from Landscape), along with the bitter tone of the letters, SÃ¶derquist conveys the existential emptiness and exclusion that exile from Germany meant for the writer.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/oc2FmpP7oh4SgmQVAFEGa6fD9IG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"}],"release_date":"1989-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":40,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Brev ur tystnaden","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
