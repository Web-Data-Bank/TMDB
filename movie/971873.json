Conductor Jiří Bělohlávek mirrors Lehnhoff's approach in his sophisticated plumbing of the score's depths, with every shift in texture carefully laid bare by an inspired London Philharmonic Orchestra. Nina Stemme's Isolde and Robert Gambill's Tristan, both gloriously lyrical, are matched by superb performances from René Pape as the betrayed and vulnerable King Marke and Bo Skovhus as Kurwenal, deeply touching in his helpless devotion to Tristan. This High Definition recording of a production of uncommon intimacy reveals the opera's music and drama in a new light.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gWH6D8PlCOYr1arjhgbkrh7BlGn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":358,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tristan und Isolde (Glyndenbourne)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
