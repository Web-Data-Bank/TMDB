It’s a nostalgic look towards a new era of agriculture, with beautifully crafted backgrounds, delicate animation and a completely unique score by long-time Ghibli composer (and absolute legend) Joe Hisaishi. (Yeah, we can’t believe this happened either).  It’s not a perfect utopia, but a version of a future we can all reach if we just decide to put in the work.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9pMrbUtcAYMou6VdeLMvpShnSh4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":156784,"logo_path":"/wzJ5mA14ibhzOntBarqAfYAz4Xc.png","name":"THE LINE","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2021-07-13","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dear Alice","video":false,"vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":1}
