They have always taught that Egypt is in the Near East, the Middle East, the Mediterranean and even the Fertile Crescent. They have never informed the world that Egypt is and always has been on the Continent of Africa.  While White publishers controlled everything written and taught about Africa - - and often published books stating that the Ancient Egyptians were White - - no one, except Black people, complained. However, since Black people began publishing their own work and using the internet to tell our story, suddenly everyone is interested in setting Black people straight by insisting that the Ancient Egyptians were neither Black nor white, but Arabs, like the Arabs of today.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/63LGEe8quM9JLpfQObDE6Xaf2cX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1991-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When Black Men Ruled the World: Egypt During the Golden Age","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
