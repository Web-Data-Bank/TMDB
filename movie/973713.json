Specific persons are not so important in the \"Poem\", the fragrance of time is important, because, among other things, a huge layer of culture of an entire epoch has entered into the \"Poem\", which for many young people today has become a long-past history.\"","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":178916,"logo_path":null,"name":"Гоголь-центр","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-05-01","revenue":0,"runtime":68,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gogol online: Akhmatova.
