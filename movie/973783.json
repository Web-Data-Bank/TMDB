When Raka (Barkha Sengupta), a hot, 20-something, gun-toting coal-mafia’s amorous advents are rejected by college-goer Akash (Om), she turns his life into a living hell. So, Akash, along with his family, flees Ranigunj in order to escape Raka’s wrath and joins a college in Kolkata under the alias of Rohit Roy. Here, he meets Rini (Megha Chakraborty) and romance blooms.
