During 260 km of walk, the Pilgrims spread the word of their experiences abroad and try to reconnect with their families, estranged through the years of migration. They fight the guilt and the sense of blame for migration, and, against the evermore crumbling trust in the Ukrainian state, attempt to organize through the only existing for them institution, the Church. Τhe film speaks of the controversial rise of the Church institution in a post-soviet state, as a force preoccupied not only with the spiritual, but also with the social and the political.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/idnPtcIHPIA3FME7OWjlCuPFQwq.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HU","name":"Hungary"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2016-03-30","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Road of a Migrant","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
