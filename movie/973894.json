The members of the Night Wolves, Russia’s largest and most notorious biker gang, fiercely loyal to Vladimir Putin and boasting diehard chapters across the former USSR, took up arms in 2014 and joined the Moscow-backed separatists; now, inside their extraordinary base, the men open up about the families they left behind. Against the backdrop of a fragile ceasefire, what does the resurgence of these paramilitary petrol-heads mean for a war-weary Ukraine and Russia’s ever-deteriorating relationship with the West?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9UWQZGQgGJR4JZvuGhnjZaXS53P.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2016-03-31","revenue":0,"runtime":14,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rebels with a Cause: The Kremlin's Wolves in Ukraine","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
