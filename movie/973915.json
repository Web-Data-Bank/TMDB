The biggest attraction of the area is the historic water mill, which becomes a great place for fun for an amused crowd. As is usually the case in the countryside, its equal inhabitants are - next to people - animals. No wonder the little heroes become friends with them. And so days go by together. Almost each of them brings a new, amazing and unexpected adventure. The child's imagination makes even ordinary events take on the flavor of fairy tales and mystery.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6iJkmXSWMGYBgew3UG3oZ0K3maR.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1985-10-27","revenue":0,"runtime":351,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Polish","iso_639_1":"pl","name":"Polski"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Urwisy z Doliny Młynów","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
