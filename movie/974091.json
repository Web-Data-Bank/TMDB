Old home movies from an unknown family signify the desire to codify and solidify memory, and by extension, history. History, like matter, is made up of small particles that are constantly moving. Our belief that it is solid and immutable is illusion. And yet our obsession with documenting our lives though photographs and video blurs the boundary between image and reality, so that what we remember is not our lived experience, but the rearrangement of electrons, or the flickering light on the wall.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/VExmPyhajw4WVRDTskKbBRPUOK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":175104,"logo_path":null,"name":"Labyrinth Media, LLC","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-05-09","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Particle Theories","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
