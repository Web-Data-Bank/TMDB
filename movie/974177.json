In 2018 Elin filed to change her gender in the US, and shortly thereafter proceeded to change her gender and marriage documents in Japan as well. However, Japan has refused to recognize her transition as it would result in the de facto acceptance of same-sex marriage. To put it simply, Elin broke the Japanese legal system- a system that does not allow transgender people to have children, a system that does not allow same-sex marriage, and a system that does not recognize queer people as people with the same lives as those who identify as heterosexual.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/2qAT7SrIjCyxkkmQ0b3y9mszlq2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"It's just our family","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
