Even with all the emotional charge of a remote past. Confined to his apartment, the author confronts his images with the question of how we should tell the story, through an exploratory \"anti-documentary\" collage of various visual and sound fragments, apparently disconnected from each other. The use of the archival material found is crossed in an experimental way to reveal the daily presence of Becoming, the confinement, the rain, the crises, the media, the poverty, the matinees, the streets and the voices plunged into oblivion.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lighIhG2JGhBVwRiRlHVWHa9FJO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On the Oblivion","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
