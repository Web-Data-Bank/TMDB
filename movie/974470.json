In little over a hundred years the natural landscape has been transformed into the industrial hellscape of Kalgoorlie-Boulder. As incumbent Mayor John Bowler starts to campaign for a second term, independent prospector John ‘General Hercules’ Katahanas decides to run against him on an anti-corruption ticket. What starts out as a quirky David-vs-Goliath political battle, unravels into a portrait of a man, a town and a country sent mad by the timeless cycles of exploitation, racism and greed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ylpOHU2dKjFRrNEdNrdBJTw34at.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":175141,"logo_path":null,"name":"Toy Shop Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-12","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"General Hercules","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
