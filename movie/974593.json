Then there is another voice summoning her to go to a park on top of a skyscraper. Once she arrives there, she meets up with other people who also have no recollection of who they are or what they were doing before arriving at this destination as instructed by the voice. All the people assembled there possess superhuman powers, such as Eno's psychic power, Umoth's x-ray vision, Neia's teleportation powers, Azalea's telepathy, and Locke's electrical wizardry. Who has summoned them, and what will the five super-psychics confront?","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hrMHFVm1WMnFKmASlQPUVGwkOS6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4287,"logo_path":"/hIxV81PD6eNsNluKemgiWwdZhcb.png","name":"Nippon Animation","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":528,"logo_path":"/fO3Aof3lXQclYpBByYC8aneTXwA.png","name":"Bandai Visual","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"1991-08-22","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Locke the Superman: New World Command","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
