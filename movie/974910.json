The film is a portrait of Stefano's human evolution, an artist with an incandescent spirit who performs in a macrocosm where desire and fantasy, light and darkness, theatrically and sensibly intertwine with each other. It celebrates being sensitive to one's own queerness which finds the strongest means to assert itself in bravery, kindness and identity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6sBILzTAKCmoQvnmeIQhqIhaJT8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Arcadia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
