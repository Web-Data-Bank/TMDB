Following his death, his producers and collaborators have put all their strength into continuing transmitting his work, his vision and his films. Also a PhD in anthropology, Mantas Kvedaravičius wished to testify as a filmmaker as far as possible from the agitation of the media and the politicians. With huge force and sensitivity, Mariupolis 2 depicts life as it continues amidst the bombing and reveals images that convey both tragedy and hope.","popularity":0.999,"poster_path":"/6dXXRtlBJoxKlIt9pA6o3ikUzk5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":48496,"logo_path":null,"name":"Studio Uljana Kim","origin_country":"LT"},{"id":121005,"logo_path":null,"name":"Extimacy Films","origin_country":""},{"id":32545,"logo_path":null,"name":"Twenty Twenty Vision Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":177058,"logo_path":"/ysWKUQsMCel31NVLcV8M5AJe7te.png","name":"Easy Riders Films","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"LT","name":"Lithuania"}],"release_date":"2022-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mariupolis 2","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
