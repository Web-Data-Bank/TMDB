Not yet titled, the film is about the life of Francesca Xavier Cabrini. There are certain themes which are timeless and others that are timely. In the case of this production, it is both. The drive, initiative, power and success of Mother Cabrini is not only inspirational, but a lesson in accomplishment for the greater good. In the 1890s, Mother Cabrini was a social activist who championed the empowerment of women and the rights of immigrants. It was a time when women were treated as second-class citizens, while the treatment of immigrants was even worse. Her philanthropic accomplishments equaled the likes of Vanderbilt and Rockefeller, yet remarkably, Mother Cabrini a woman, Italian immigrant and a nun accomplished all of it without a penny to her name.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Untitled Cabrini film","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
