The camera is placed below the instrument so it can catch the light entering the instrument as it is played. There is a direct correlation between what we see and what we hear, each light has its counterpart in sound. The film lasts for 13 minutes (one performance on B&W film, the other in colour) and is a specific improvisation for the camera.  Evan Parker is one of the major figures in European free improvisation. Over the last 40 years he has developed a new musical language for the saxophone, particularly the soprano. Parker’s style makes use of a number of techniques one of which is ‘circular-breathing’. This allows him to play for great stretches of time without having to pause to breath, creating long passages of uninterrupted sound. The speed of Parker’s playing creates notes on top of notes, counterpoint on top of counterpoint.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":12,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Portrait of Evan Parker (Silver/Gold)","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
