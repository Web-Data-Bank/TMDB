However, that ail changed one night when his mother, wife, and three children were killed by Mexican soldiers. On that fateful night he became one of the boldest warriors of all time. Originally, Goyathlay, \"One Who Yawns\", Geronimo became the most famous Apache for standing against the U.S. government and for holding out the longest. In 1876, Federal authorities captured and forced Geronimo and his band onto a U.S. reservation at San Carlos, Arizona. It was described as \"Hell's Forty Acres\". He soon escaped to roam Arizona and New Mexico. He was pursued relentlessly by more than five thousand U.S. troops.  Exhausted and hopelessly outnumbered, Geronimo surrendered in 1886 to live out the rest of his life imprisoned in Oklahoma.","popularity":0.84,"poster_path":"/f6N1WVgvxx25JV3Pn2HpS7vhWQj.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wild Wild West: Geronimo","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
