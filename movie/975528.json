Her creativity seems to be hibernating, thanks to a series of awful relationships and the general mood of the season. But when she meets Eddie, a 25 year-old Lakota man, and law school dropout, he could be just the tonic for her winter blues. But Eddie’s a complex person, so complex, in fact, that the two of them may end up searching for something that will end their romance. Self-described as “A modern day, inter-tribal, love story that shows true love is found in the season you love yourself,” A Winter Love is an eye-opening romantic drama filmed in Minnesota.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Winter Love","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
