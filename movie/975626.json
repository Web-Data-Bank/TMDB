Hudec (1893-1958), a famous architect in Shanghai. For the first time Alessa visits Slovakia the birthplace of her father. Together with her brother Theo, they decide to visit China after 63 years - the country of their childhood and youth. This inspired documentary not only explores the many exciting details of the life of L.E. Hudec, father of Asian high-rises, but also serves as an authentic testimony of life of Europeans in Colonial Shanghai before The People's Republic of China was formed. It presents the never-before-seen 16mm home-movies that were shot between 1927-1938 by Ladislav Hudec himself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/3ZvhHWEIXmwhl1zqvMWXg7w9dq9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2010-09-03","revenue":0,"runtime":67,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenčina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Man Who Changed Shanghai","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
