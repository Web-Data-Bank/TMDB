From this point of view, this part of California is decades ahead of Europe. Lesbian mothers, pioneers of homoparenting, constitute the great majority of homosexual parents. Who are their children? How did they grow up? Does one feel like a child or a teenager like the others when one grows up in a family and social environment that is predominantly homosexual? The film gives a voice to young adults raised by homosexuals, who tell their stories with candor and humor.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ieeungfdFy8N9JnQVNS1iI6rJYc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2004-12-21","revenue":0,"runtime":47,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Nous, enfants d'homos","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
