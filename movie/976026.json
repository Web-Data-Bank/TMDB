Using a performance of Bach's Fugue #24 in B Minor by harpsichordist Elaine Camparone as the work's structural foundation, he manipulates the initial musical theme in twelve successive \"chapters\" that distill the fugue into its elemental parts. Choosing from the twelve chapters, the viewer can access and recompose his/her own fugue in a real-time manifestation of Bach's musical form. Digital effects such as split screens and inserts, which isolate specific visual elements, allow the viewer to deconstruct - and reconstruct - Bach's serpentine language of counterpoint and theme and variations.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1988-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Bachdisc","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
