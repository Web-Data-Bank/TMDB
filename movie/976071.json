In Scammed, Paul Wilson, dubbed the \"World's Greatest Con Man,\" and his team take a detailed look inside the complicated schemes and micro-cons that have plagued unsuspecting people for hundreds, even thousands of years, showing how many of these scams not only survived but evolved to be brutally effective with the help of modern technology. In each episode, Paul plays out long cons on designated marks so that he can help expose the cons, hustles and schemes that have victimized so many people, while teaching others how to avoid them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lF0mwO10yEJo7tgtj9IxwfhCwfO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Scammed","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
