Through this agreement, Europe was to be thrown into war. For a long time, the relationship between Hitler and Stalin was ignored: their mutual fascination, their moves to get closer, the marks of confidence they exchanged and all the benefits they derived from the German-Soviet pact, before resuming their war to the death in June 41 with the \"Barbarossa\" operation.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8k683GKiuKM9QspAANjt80YYew8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39460,"logo_path":"/AiQxylbHR61M4NA6KmQ2aFKhOt2.png","name":"Siècle Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-05-09","revenue":0,"runtime":104,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hitler-Staline, le choc des tyrans","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
