Would fire pour from the sky, buildings shatter, floods destroy Washington DC and Los Angeles slide into the Pacific? That’s how Hollywood has interpreted the end of the Maya great calendar cycle on December 21, 2012, in the movie “2012” with John Cusack. This documentary looks for the truth behind the compelling myth - is there evidence of global upheaval on a massive scale?
