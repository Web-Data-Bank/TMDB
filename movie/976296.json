This documentary, directed by Céline Metger, deals with homosexuality in Cameroon. What a shock to learn that homosexuality is penalized in Cameroon and to see men in prison for the sole reason of being homosexual. We follow the struggle of Alice, a lawyer who fights for the cause of homosexuals and for the revision of the criminal law. The director devoted two years of her life to this documentary. She quickly established links with gays and lesbians. The documentary is both revolting by the treatment inflicted on homosexuals and endearing by the confidences of these men and women rejected by Cameroonian society. And what courage to have accepted to testify openly!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iKzoJEivuuJyWjaEGG3xDWqM5Gw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-04-15","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Cameroun : Sortir du Nkuta?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
