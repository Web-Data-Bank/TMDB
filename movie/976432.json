So it makes perfect sense that any kid with access to a camcorder would film their own Voorhees-inspired epic . . . even if it meant lighting themselves on fire with a homemade blowtorch. AGFA and Bleeding Skull! are proud to present THE F13TH FAN FILM MIXTAPE -- an awe-inspiring compilation of the best-of-the-best in DIY Voorhees tributes from Jasonâ€™s biggest fans. Underage driving! Cameos from Michael Myers! Illegal usage of songs by The Beastie Boys! Featuring digest versions of our favorite full-length rippers, unseen trailers, and deranged clips, THE F13TH FAN FILM MIXTAPE is a valentine to the greatest horror franchise in history. And also teenage lunatics everywhere.","popularity":0.604,"poster_path":"/mMVrGpzie6SFjeBp1cj5G2zm5g5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":110219,"logo_path":null,"name":"American Genre Film Archives","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2019-12-13","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"A compilation of D.I.Y. madness from Jason's biggest fans.","title":"The F13th Fan Film Mixtape","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
