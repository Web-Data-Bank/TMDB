Having found a job in home care for the elderly, the woman will have to reach the people assigned to her in the most remote places, discovering a world that lives the contingent situation with serene acceptance. In front of the camera, women and men on the threshold of a hundred years old expose personal memories and emotions, letting themselves be infected by the unpredictable musical drifts of the protagonist.
