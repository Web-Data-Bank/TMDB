The explosive creative energy he delivers is stunning, but at the same time, he also displays his egotistical nature and wanton lifestyle. Director Pan Hsin An is the same age as Liou. He peeps into Liou’s life through a camera lens, questioning and exploring. During the filming process, the two often fail to understand each other, and each has his doubts about the other. But in the end, at opposite ends of the scale, they find the same desires behind huge differences.","popularity":0.661,"poster_path":"/epSloNnIpVpDWQboKi9jJT03FRa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-08-28","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Leo & Nymphia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
