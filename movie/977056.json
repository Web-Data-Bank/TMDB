In Ritual Objects, we come across a group of nuns who demystify the iconic prayer wheel, walk us through the choreography of a customary welcoming procession, and learn how to prepare a torma, or cake offering, for an intricate tantric ceremony. A selection from Peabody Award-winning documentarian Bari Pearlmanâ€™s Nangchen Shorts series, the film brings life and action to little- and well-known Tibetan Buddhist sacraments.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6jZRnJIVd6bEC92dIENGOdJn0j4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ritual Objects","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
