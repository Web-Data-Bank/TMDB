Moving in with his father Stan, a gifted but eccentric chef turned doorman, and at loggerheads with his ex-wife and her new partner over how to deal with their 9-year-old son Ezra’s Asperger’s, Brandel decides the solution is to kidnap Ezra and take him on a trek across the country. The result is honest, hilarious and heart-warming.","popularity":3.933,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":185041,"logo_path":"/7M5wbBecXNrhM7u0Mxg4kvj8wZv.png","name":"Closer Media","origin_country":"US"},{"id":144610,"logo_path":"/9qyKQTuU8vIlnffXKTjHnO3VIxw.png","name":"Wayfarer Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2023-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"In Production","tagline":"","title":"Inappropriate Behaviour","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
