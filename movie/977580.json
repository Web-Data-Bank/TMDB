So, reality is not a big deal when you are used to it. But opening the eyes a little is all it takes to produce a few gentle cracks on the ground of perceptual habits, and realize that things – including the urban architecture we pass by everyday – have their own energy; that steel, concrete, asphalt all have an unexpected vibrancy.
