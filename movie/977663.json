In the documentary BIT - BALLERINA BULLDOG we follow her as she gets the greatest opportunity of her career - a joint exhibition with the world's leading psaligrapher professor Qiao in Beijing. Bit Vejle struggles with chronic fatigue syndrome and as the big exhibition is fast approaching, she still hasn't completed her major works.
