He's been standoffish and increasingly jealous of the neighbor boy, Noah (Ricky Spanish). However, Joy feels her husband has no right to be jealous when he hasn't done anything to make her feel sexy and wanted in MONTHS. Homeless teen Cassie (Lisey Sweet) stalks a dad who showed kindness by sharing sandwiches with her. When Cassie refuses to leave and comes onto him stronger than before, Ben (Will Pounder) is conflicted. If he gives in this one time, maybe she'll get out of his life and never come back.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fFlebbMcucFYjOCFPjZtlYZL4Mf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":97187,"logo_path":"/8b3EX6zgcWIBhlAMJjlaX8j35hS.png","name":"Pure Taboo","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-10-01","revenue":0,"runtime":93,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Treating Her Right","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
