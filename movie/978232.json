Da Corte plays four characters in the video: the artist Marcel Duchamp; Duchamp’s female alter ego, Rrose Sélavy; Duchamp dressed as the Joker in Tim Burton’s 1989 film Batman; and one of two figures in Brancusi’s sculpture The Kiss (1916), who comes to life via stop motion animation.  The accumulation of color and eventual emancipation of The Kiss is central to this story of love, loss, and transformation.
