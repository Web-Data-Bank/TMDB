It may loosely be described as a movie about the making of a movie, in which Corirossi plays “Nick Corirossi,” a balding lecher and fraud director whose messianic delusions turn out to be true.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4Ju97jMrQyABLE8MmoCzwL5yjco.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hector","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
