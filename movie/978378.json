Beginning in 1989, and going up to the present, the film essay Sunny Night tells of political and social events since Georgian Independence. A variety of formats and sources, disparate images and voices report on protests, recommencements, uproars and wars, and religious identity that centres around the dominant religion of the nation. In the midst of the ongoing shifts and the various state of affairs, the patriarch stands out as the only constant figure. Meanwhile the sermonised religion begins to take on radical forms, going as far as priests forming front row human-chains, leading protests of several thousand orthodox believers chasing a handful of LGBT activist throughout the streets of Tbilisi in May 2013.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":48538,"logo_path":null,"name":"Blinker Filmproduktion","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":126903,"logo_path":null,"name":"Georgian National Film Center","origin_country":"GE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GE","name":"Georgia"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"}],"release_date":"2017-10-20","revenue":0,"runtime":107,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Georgian","iso_639_1":"ka","name":"ქართული"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Sunny Night","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
