Their intersectional identities inform the creative process, from the first lyric to the polished track. In an industry where authenticity is rare, these artists unapologetically sing their truths. But the industry is cutthroat â€“ our characters are dissuaded from following their passions even before they pick up an instrument. Their identities, the very thing they most value and prioritize, presents as their biggest obstacle.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iN1QDHp8Y4Q3PIZUjB8fUXS33KZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":44,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Colour of Music","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
