It earned them gushing reviews, three Grammy nominations and high-profile fans like Robert Plant and Jack White. Watching them on stage, it's easy to see why. At their sold out Sydney gig, the Shakes were powerful, playful and gut-wrenchingly good. At the centre of it all lies Howard, a howling storm of soul and swagger, who proved as charming as she is cheeky. Your front row seat to this sublime show awaits... get comfy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7BBVa4hKGlY0KzVK8HDlNcyxKEw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Alabama Shakes: Live at The Metro Theatre","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
