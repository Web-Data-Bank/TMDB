In 1998 German engineer Tilman Walterfang found a shipwreck from the 9th Century blanketed by intact gold, silver and ceramic items. As we uncover clues and reveal the story of the wreck, reenactments transport us back in time to an age of the legendary Sinbad the Sailor, when vicious seas ravaged wooden boats like matchsticks. Through interviews with maritime archaeologists and ceramic experts we bring these characters to life by examining unique items recovered from the wreck and painting a vivid picture of glorious 9th Century Tang China. We reveal where the treasure now lies, in high security storage in Singapore.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/44XDqrWNPiBkIT1ixdtLX23LKlQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-08-08","revenue":0,"runtime":45,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Secrets of the Tang Treasure Ship","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
