Featuring TV performances - notably the \"Old Grey Whistle Test\", their first ever TV appearance - and live concert footage from the much bootlegged Hatfield Polytechnic Show in February 1979 (including the first ever live performance of 'Message In A Bottle'), Miami's Gusman Theater in 1979, Gateshead Stadium in July 1982 and the Atlanta Omni in 1983. All the performances are interspersed with the band's own personal Super-8 footage and interviews with all the band members and their manager, Miles Copeland. A truly fascinating video.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dxBrlTOQ3zDZ4aa9K8no0fpidqo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17992,"logo_path":"/2IxeffnwErEvVcUAbaPrp31PtbV.png","name":"PolyGram Video","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-05-30","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Police - Outlandos To Synchronicities","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
