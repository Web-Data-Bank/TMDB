For the band, who had always toured mainly at live houses, performing at a venue with a capacity of over 10,000 was a tremendous challenge, but they cleared this hurdle in an ideal way. The band's all-standing setup, the band's sound that created a bigger groove, and the audience's willingness to respond to the band's new challenge all came together to create a performance that is vividly conveyed in this album. This is a rare moment in which the band, who have always focused on the theme of \"connection,\" demonstrate their full potential as a live band. The rehearsal documentary is also a must-see, offering a glimpse of the trials and errors of their first arena tour.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/foFznZXFjbKXmxm1fTXHqGsCG6n.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2007-03-21","revenue":0,"runtime":106,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Eizo Sakuhin Volume 3 Tour Kanpai 2006-2007 The start of a new season","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
