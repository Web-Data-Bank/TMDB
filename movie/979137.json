But when she happens upon a group of opportunists seeking to prove the efficacy of their mysteriously-acquired device to a potential buyer, her fortunes seem set to change. All they need is a 'volunteer', and for a small sum of cash she's lured into their machine. While she emerges seemingly unscathed, a violent turn of events makes Rani realize that changing the trajectory of her life might just be matter of a second chance, or a third - or maybe just a little more time.","popularity":0.903,"poster_path":"/AazLH0Her4xBHtDfdbUJDhVPCRq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":178820,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eleven Elements","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IN","name":"India"}],"release_date":"2022-07-24","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Hindi","iso_639_1":"hi","name":"हिन्दी"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Rani Rani Rani","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
