Filmed over a week inside the rehearsal room capturing the energy, humour and pure joy of one of Britain's best loved choreographers. Sadly the full stage work could not be realised or performed publicly due to his untimely death and this footage is the last of his work to be seen. But contained in these short 3 minutes is his bold signature; dance with real physicality, humour, passion and seriously entertaining.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ApwWOD7MnXQQNKsAR2e9xIci6C9.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-02-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"10 Men","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
