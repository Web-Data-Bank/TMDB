Sergei Eisenstein's final film, this is the first part of a three-part biopic of Tsar Ivan IV of  Russia, which was never completed due to the producer's dissatisfaction with Eisenstein's attempts to use forbidden experimental filming techniques and excessive cost overruns.  The second part was completed but not released for a decade after Eisenstein's death and a change of heart in the USSR government toward his work; the third part was only in its earliest stage of filming when shooting was stopped altogether.","popularity":6.482,"poster_path":"/rzFWfdq6CXLCnlfXTTZs9W9dMR2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":344,"logo_path":"/xenuUvcunUNpbaDOYGhWZERaym7.png","name":"Mosfilm","origin_country":"SU"},{"id":2590,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alma-Ata Studio","origin_country":"SU"},{"id":111593,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tsentralnuyu Obedinyonnuyu Kinostudiyu","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SU","name":"Soviet Union"}],"release_date":"1944-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ivan the Terrible, Part I","video":false,"vote_average":7.376,"vote_count":157}
