The two go out on the town, and Faust lays eyes on Marguerite, a virgin whose brother Valentin is her protector. Valentin goes to war, leaving Marguerite in the care of his friend Siébel and under the watchful eye of his neighbor, Marthe. Faust courts Marguerite while Méphistophélès chats with Marthe. Seduction, loss of reputation, pregnancy, and tragedy follow.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":29949,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lubin Manufacturing Company","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1915-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Faust","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
