This programme follows the love, lust and laughs over the course of their holiday as the women drink, dance and snog their way around the island. Despite being shadowed by the papparazi and some negative islanders, nothing can stop our women from fighting for their right to party.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/wZRKA42kiE1S78bny8gMeuhbHCV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1421,"logo_path":"/uWCPDzKkQnOxQ5spgKpD8wzSIP1.png","name":"World of Wonder","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2001-01-11","revenue":0,"runtime":46,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lesbians Go Mad In Lesbos","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
