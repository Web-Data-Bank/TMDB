Paul Van Doren never skateboarded, surfed, snowboarded, or flipped a BMX bike, but his simple, rubber-soled sneaker from 1966 has been at the heart of the global action-sports movement for half a century. This is the candid, comedic, and occasionally tragic portrait of Paul and his company, some of the world-renowned athletes he inspired, and the hard lessons he's learned along the way, including why you must NEVER CATCH PIGEONS.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iOTzYXT8ZUmzidN8eEB9cMlZoBE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-10-10","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Never Catch Pigeons: And Eleven More Hard Lessons from Mr. Paul Van Doren","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
