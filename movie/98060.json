When one of them leaves for the valley to spend Christmas vacation with his family he is temporarily replaced with an adolescent boy. The other man is both annoyed and intrigued by the boy and his habits: he listens to loud music, sleeps too long in the mornings and doesn't drink any alcohol. They barely speak to one another in the first couple of days. But when an avalanche cuts their small hut from electricity they slowly start growing more fond of each other.","popularity":1.364,"poster_path":"/gFJ88hhy2Se6eqyul9zrTs6heu8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12660,"logo_path":null,"name":"22 Dicembre","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":93642,"logo_path":null,"name":"Edisonvolta","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"release_date":"1960-04-06","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Time Stood Still","video":false,"vote_average":7.067,"vote_count":15}
