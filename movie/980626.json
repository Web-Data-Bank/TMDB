But just at the moment when we begin to believe in the correctness and invulnerability of the hero, real tests begin for him. Yura learns that his grandfather is in the hospital because he saw his enemy during the Great Patriotic War in a report from Latvia about the parade in honor of the SS. Now the hero does not doubt for a moment that it is he who must restore justice and arrange a meeting between his grandfather and SS Untersturmführer Alfred Weber. To do this, he again has to move from words to deeds. Broken fists, cars and the hero's heart - and that's not all that he will have to face on the way to Europe.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1HktNYh7TfZbA3sb5xZMQk3WAwU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2022-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Grandson","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
