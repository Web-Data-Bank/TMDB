Model T’s to War focuses on the valiant work of the American Field Service, ambulance sections assigned to help the French Army in its fight against German forces. These young men drove Ford-built Model T’s to the front lines and saw their greatest glory in the battle of Verdun in 1916, when Field Service ambulances transported more than 250,000 wounded. Although American readers regularly followed the adventures of these brave ambulanciers through numerous accounts published in local and national newspapers of the era, few today know about their heroic deeds. Model T’s to War seeks to shed light on this forgotten story.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Model T’s to War: American Ambulances on the Western Front, 1914-1918","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
