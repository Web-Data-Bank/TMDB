Courageous squadron commander Douglas Bader, I4 - kill hero Cobber Kain, Ginger Lacey - the top Battle of Britain ace with 18 victims - and many other RAF pilots owed their reputations and their lives to this toughest mount of all. The Hurricane was outnumbered but never outclassed, designed to hit the enemy hard, absorb tremendous punishment yet live to fight another day. Featuring colour footage of the last surviving aircraft, alongside original combat film.\r This is the definitive documentary of a fighter plane that truly changed the course of history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qtbFGJ2coObSOHARYk33NRo3q4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2009-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":57,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Hurricane Story","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
