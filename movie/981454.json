A film audition typecasts Bashar to play an Al Qaeda terrorist role. The utilities are due and Bashar has twenty-four hours to make the money. For the remaining hours left until tomorrow, an unceasing flow of passengers ride in Bashar's taxi and give the Arab cabbie the run around on issues that deal with suicide bombers, George Bush, Cat Stevens, the war in Iraq, music, and world geography. Bashar's quest to make the money is won until he realizes he has to choose between the Department of Homeland Security and his family.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rUZJWrZr4s7jzEAd3FwVrS88uRi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":151026,"logo_path":null,"name":"BintFilm","origin_country":""},{"id":7317,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinema Libre Studio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":92,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Arabic","iso_639_1":"ar","name":"العربية"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Driving to Zigzigland","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
