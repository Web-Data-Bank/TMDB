Hostile to outsiders, the Akha today are the living remnants of a former time, the bygone era of the Chinese Middle Empire. The Akha have a dangerously bad reputation: smuggling, destroying the forest, ignoring frontiers, growing opium. If they remain in the hills the Tha√Ø will eventually destroy them, if they accept to go down to the valleys they will surely die of disease. The Akha are running out of options.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1995-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Double Death - The Akha of the Golden Triangle","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
