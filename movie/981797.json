With no going back to the way it was before, it invites its audience to dream up new stories to help guide our way forward as a species. Tackling COVID-19 has shown us that we can act collectively to protect each other and it is possible to create a better future. It has shown us that we are capable of the kind of action needed to flatten the other curves but to do so requires bold vision and investing in an equitable future.\r We are determined not to give in to fear or to lose hope. Even in times of uncertainty, Amnesty will continue to call out human rights violations wherever we see them.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-12-14","revenue":0,"runtime":4,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Breathe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
