Ruth Grantland returns to her country home. She is courted by two of the village beaux, who propose marriage. She likes the boys, but not sufficiently to marry them. Her preference is for Jack Hall, a young man of extreme culture and refinement. She tells the two boys that she will consent to marry them if they can beat her in a footrace, taking each one on separately. They agree, and she, being fleet of foot, runs away from them, crossing the line far in the lead. Jack, riding horseback, happens along and takes in the fun. Later, he proposes to Ruth.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":15634,"logo_path":null,"name":"Vitagraph Company of America","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1912-11-08","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Modern Atalanta","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
