So massive was this premeditated interference in God’s created order, that the Almighty used His creation to obliterate the monstrous works of corruption as well as the hands that created them.  Learn why God would bring a great flood upon his world, and how such a flood of global impact might have been accomplished by God using only the forces of His own creation.  See the physical evidence of the Great Flood and how it was recorded in eyewitness accounts.  See the likely landing place of the Ark of Noah in the mountains of Urartu along the border between Turkey and Iran based not only on the ancient accounts of eyewitnesses, but on the physical evidence (actual artifacts) existing today.  Finally, learn how ancient Egypt played a central role in the events just prior to, and immediately after the Great Flood.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/fAbbBA8Ao8D4IT36stz4CJIOBfM.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":176314,"logo_path":null,"name":"SEPDAC Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2019-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":219,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Turkish","iso_639_1":"tr","name":"Türkçe"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"The Great Flood, the Ark of Noah, and artifacts found.","title":"Planetary Catastrophe","video":true,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
