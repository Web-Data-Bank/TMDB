Spanning 15 years of matriarch-led resistance, a small group of determined elders in the village of Iskut heal from the wounds of colonization to push back against law enforcement, government, and some of the worldâ€™s largest multinational companies.  Nestled between scenes of stand-offs and blockades, land defenders reflect on how their history of forced displacement, residential schools, and trauma strengthened their resolve to protect the very land that was so essential to their healing journey.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5F7lW7tkdbcJQZho7wKqcCcqNQP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-05-22","revenue":0,"runtime":101,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Klabona Keepers","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
