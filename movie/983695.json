Through the medium of potato printing the film shows how Madame Potatoe struggles to cope within the world in which she is placed. She retreats into the earth leaving her image to continue along its own increasingly exploitative path.  Madame Potatoe was first shown as part of Emma Calder's MA show at the RCA, which comprised a life-sized, motorised Madame Potatoe eating crisps and watching the film on telly. She was sat in a room papered with Madame Potatoe print wall paper.  Shown at the Tate Gallery, animation festivals, CH4 TV and world wide TV. Madame Potatoe print bought by the V&A for the prints and drawings collection. Many press clippings and associated articles are available.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":176498,"logo_path":null,"name":"Environmental Media","origin_country":""},{"id":73829,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bob Godfrey Films","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":176499,"logo_path":null,"name":"School Of Film And TV","origin_country":""},{"id":29427,"logo_path":null,"name":"Royal College of Art","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1983-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":6,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Madame Potatoe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
