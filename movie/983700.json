Will they infiltrate his anti-ant plant? Can they defeat his security systems? What's he got against the ants anyway, and are they as innocent as they seem? Why don't they rescue that poor bear too? What does it all mean? What's going on? Whose hands are those? What!? - All these questions, and more, will be asked when you see the film!  The short was constructed fairly haphazardly via many different animation techniques, including stop-motion (filmed on Super-8), 3D computer models, morphed paintings, 2D digital cutouts and the odd bit of live-action for good measure.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":176501,"logo_path":null,"name":"University Of Wales College","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2000-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Remarkably Bold Venture of the Rabbit","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
