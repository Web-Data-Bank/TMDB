Eno's perspectives on his music and working methods surface elliptically, through interviews and footage of him in the studio and in lectures. Eno emerges as a meticulous musician, articulate critic, and, ultimately, an inscrutable personality. The tape's title is taken from a set of cards bearing aphorisms, which Eno uses as a random element of advice in his working process. Velez uses intricate audio and video effects to heighten the elusive nature of Eno's music and character. He begins the tape with a quote from Heraclitus: \"The nature of things is in the habit of concealing itself\" a paradox that eminently suits his subject matter.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vO0HcCkynjgLL7dkecr6NbhJigs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1984-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":13,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Oblique Strategist Too","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
