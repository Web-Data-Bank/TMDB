The Queer Tango movement takes the popular dance and reinterprets it as both a provocation and celebration. Otar and Misha are members of this community who challenge the conventions of the traditional tango community. The euphoric feeling of the dance notwithstanding, there is genuine concern regarding the safety of this beautiful expression of intimacy, sensuality and joy, in a country which does not provide anti-discrimination protection and where homophobia is rife. Aleksandr M. Vinogradov’s film highlights what is at stake for Otar, Misha and their friends.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/a0yoAFbKnkbjUWol72rMOBQpG1T.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":97,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Before We Move","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
