In the last few weeks, intense warfare has surreally mixed places and people and created a post-apocalyptic dimension revealing new qualities and roles. Thousands of Kyivans have moved to live in subway stations. The capital city's previously calm suburbs have been transformed into battle zones of destruction and looting by Russian occupiers. People no longer live according to \"workdays\" or \"weekends,\" counting instead the number of days since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine... The film presents this day in the lives of a pop music star, video engineer, historian, art restorer, polar researcher, and pensioner, who were all forced to radically change their lives.","popularity":0.927,"poster_path":"/opyfkjhCBR4YoKTnn1sDb0otie8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":117001,"logo_path":"/tLhSGNNKX4VwCNbvPMissO3ea5j.png","name":"Babylon'13","origin_country":"UA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"PL","name":"Poland"},{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2022-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":79,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"One Day in Ukraine","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
