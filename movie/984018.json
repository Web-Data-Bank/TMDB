Historically, they are wandering African musicians considered to be a repository of the oral tradition. This film focuses on a master drummer, Adame Drama of Burkina Faso, a descendant of a long line of griots. He is a contemporary griot whose mission in life is to preserve his heritage and pass it on to the next generation. Resisting the lure of monetary rewards of an artistic career in Europe, Adame has elected to remain in his country and for forty years has pursued his music there. This colorful film is filled with music and dance as we see him perform on stage with other musicians and in celebrations on the streets and in courtyards. He reveals the secrets of his instrument and of his style of playing. Above all, he is a proud African who had rejected cultural colonialism in favor of maintaining his identity and that of his art.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sAWlXhuFmeqE8zC5RsL5NA9pxWS.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":56,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Griot's Story","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
