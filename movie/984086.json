Documenting the activism of three decades amidst the intense sexual politics of radical feminism and social change, ‘memory film’ tells the inner story of a journey of liberation – gender fluidity, utopian feminism, love and its tribulations, the pleasure and pain of motherhood, violence against women, the desire for a world free of war and colonizing, and ultimately mortality and impermanence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":92036,"logo_path":"/yzevqr6GX0Y2hJT2rXsQhuJgNYH.png","name":"Documentary Australia Foundation","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":147226,"logo_path":"/2vo7KiWQ6y04UJSoa8iMfvDX6ry.png","name":"National Film and Sound Archive of Australia (NFSA)","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":176568,"logo_path":null,"name":"Anandi Films","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":153487,"logo_path":"/lLUhhdFmhLVKWdBpRe3Nwaa2U6h.png","name":"University of Technology Sydney","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":80,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"An immersive, poetic diary film about transformation and ‘the personal is political’.","title":"memory film: a filmmaker’s diary","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
