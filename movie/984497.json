Becoming unhoused with an infant inspired her to champion childcare and preschool as a human right. Funny and irreverent, Clarissa's infectious energy pulls us along as she presses forward, with fortitude gained through effort and loss. But juggling this work with raising a young son pushes Clarissa into a personal healthcare crisis far too common among stressed, working mothers, especially women of color. Clarissa's Battle follows her journey as a community leader, political candidate and time-stretched mother as she fights for the health and dignity of children and their parents nationwide. This isn't just Clarissa's battle - it's our battle, too.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Clarissa's Battle","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
