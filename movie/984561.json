She takes with her a necklace that was given by Syachrin to her late mother. Syachrin has become a producer and is making a film titled “Assoy”. During a birthday party of Mrs. Lies, Hetty sings a song that was composed specially by Syachrin for his wife, and this helps them to meet. The film uses songs, top singers, and a touching story, to repeat the successful formula that started with the film Terang Boelan. The singers Elvy Sukaesih, Lies Saodah, and Mansjur are popular Dangdut singers of the time, while Hetty Koes Endang was a rising pop singer. The appearance of the comedy Surya Group was designed as an added attraction, though it becomes more of a distraction.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/y9HYjZXQ9yU2SWKN80zwmxRIsJa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":176640,"logo_path":null,"name":"PT Daya Istri Film","origin_country":"ID"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"1977-02-22","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Assoy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
