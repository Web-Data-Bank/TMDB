Its foreign-born regulars live on the edge of society. The majority are illegal immigrants, unemployed and without financial resources, living at the edge of mere survival. For a small group of native Turks, this existence represents a transitory phase which might eventually lead to a better life. Cemo, one of them, is unable to carry on between hope and reality.
