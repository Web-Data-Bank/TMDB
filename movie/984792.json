Garrardâ€™s maintenance job on the building site allowed him to move about easily with his camera concealed behind his apron - into which he had cut a hole. This ingenious shooting style results in images combining imaginative angles with a not infrequent lack of focus.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":176684,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film and Photograph League","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1935-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Construction","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
