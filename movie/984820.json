The story of the Otavalo Indians is not a stereotypical tale of \"isolated people struggling to survive.\" Just the opposite. The people of Otavalo have successfully adapted their traditions of weaving and crafts to the international marketplace. Selling their textiles in the U.S., Europe and even in Japan, the Otavalos are by any measure the most prosperous Native people in South America. Theirs is a fascinating story of economic success and social change.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/5ok7WCaR1JRkTHi0Qb5WHTiYoaX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1997-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Weaving the Future","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
