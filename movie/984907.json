From the disappearing wildlife in his hometown Owen Sound to seeing news stories about melting ice sheets and decades-long droughts, there is no end to the parade of ominous news. Little wonder then, that the worried comments from Anderson’s clients and students about the future only increase and increase. And like many others, he finds it difficult to share this crushing dread with others without turning them away.  But our short film isn’t just about anguish. It’s also about what we do now. No, our individual actions may not be able to change the course of feedback loops or reverse fossil fuel extraction. But that doesn’t mean we can’t be contributing a community, we can’t be learning useful skills, and we can’t be connecting with other people and making a difference in their lives, now or later.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/tW6fKw73qex7fCduvfcfqaJ02p.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A psychotherapist struggling with climate anxiety explores what it means to live in a dying world.","title":"Feeling the Apocalypse","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
