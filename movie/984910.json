Narrator Paul Douglas tells us how “the bright lights of Broadway kindle the flame of ambition.” We first see such burning drive backstage at the Carnival Night Club in New York City as the dancers rehearse; we then watch from front of house as they perform. Next up is the Shipstads & Johnson Ice Follies, where chorus girls perform similar dance routines, only on ice skates. Seen today, “Behind the Footlights” is hardly an inducement to join the performing arts. Kicking third from the left in a line of ladies dressed in ruffles, bananas, and pineapples, all the while hoping the star breaks her ankle, is the stuff that dreams are made of, and which brings a paycheck at the end of the week.\" — Caroline Yeager","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/95sXZTIIARdO34sS7WauRMEs3Wy.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1946-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":8,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Behind the Footlights","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
