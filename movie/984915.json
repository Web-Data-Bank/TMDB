Iwan, a friendly and sympathetic guy, rides his motorcycle, and they soon develop an intimate and playful relationship. There are also others such as the shy Hendro, and the disheveled and free-spirited Tari. The drama concerns some conflict between Iwan and his father, and also Narti’s parents’ attitude toward Iwan. The film highlights the young social life on campus and the appeal is in the fresh dialogue, which is sometimes critical.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kZ8UPPVMyeIQZPaT77do4moWYek.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":162511,"logo_path":"/un8lguFbahqfdLARR1KZI5jfQWJ.png","name":"PT Rapi Film","origin_country":"ID"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"1978-07-03","revenue":0,"runtime":99,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Akibat Godaan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
