Although she was not allowed to attend school as a child, Pasang did not let that stop her from pursuing her dreams. After founding her own trekking company in Kathmandu, she blazed a trail for Nepali women via her efforts to summit Everest. Proving how big you can dream and how far you can go to achieve those dreams, she left a legacy not only for the family she has left behind, but for the myriad women following in her footsteps.","popularity":1.192,"poster_path":"/eSKvoZP5OR6FibSRK1gOGKJeSgW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":184704,"logo_path":"/bYnMEjcLi7MnV2EXJYCzbW3wr8n.png","name":"Follow Your Dream Foundation","origin_country":"US"},{"id":184705,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mila Productions","origin_country":"DE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-03-03","revenue":0,"runtime":71,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"},{"english_name":"Nepali","iso_639_1":"ne","name":""}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pasang: In the Shadow of Everest","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":2}
