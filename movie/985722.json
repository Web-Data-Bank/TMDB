The plot was organized by Robert Catesby (c.1572-1605) in an effort to end the persecution of Roman Catholics by the English government. Catesby and others hoped to replace the country’s Protestant government with Catholic leadership. Around midnight on November 4, 1605, one of the conspirators, Guy Fawkes (1570-1606), was discovered in the cellar of the Parliament building with barrels of gunpowder. Fawkes and other men involved in the plot were tried and executed for treason. Every November 5, the British celebrate Guy Fawkes Day by burning Fawkes in effigy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/s9AgwvPCz5P5Mu9ky5OUOrYXHu6.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2006-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Guy Fawkes and the Gunpowder Plot","video":true,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
