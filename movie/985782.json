To pay the bills, he channelled this love for the lens into music photography, snapping such acts as the Rolling Stones, Tina Turner and the Jackson Five. But then tragedy struck and snuffed out Richard’s creative and parental fire. Now, his adult son James attempts to understand Richard’s inner turmoil after discovering 30 hours of confessional footage, in the process making sense of the 70-year-old’s newfound zest for life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/7fwnrmYG3O4V5i6jCySfBcRJHFF.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":105801,"logo_path":"/3rh9RoodRlCw3urr21LG0gYZvSs.png","name":"MIFF Premiere Fund","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":113591,"logo_path":"/4USrvUlhniLxDqTRttL76CTxj8Z.png","name":"Good Thing Productions","origin_country":"AU"},{"id":180865,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pivot Studios","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2022-11-03","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"A film 70 years in the making.","title":"Volcano Man","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
