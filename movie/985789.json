It features superb battle re-enactments and reconstructions, dramatised 'eye-witness' accounts and delightful period personalities and the battles of the war.\r The programme also includes 3D computer graphics and expert analysis from leading historians to tell the story of the English Civil Wars.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/p7kyR5t66DXZqcNYs4xbv6p62Pr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1992-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The English Civil Wars","video":true,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
