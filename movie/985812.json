There is this gray building on a rainy day, where anyoneÂ´s windows is kept closed. Overlooking the courtyard a boy is sitting on his windowsill. He is playing with a mirrored-glass marble. It is enjoyable to watch, as well as for this other child, standing at its opened window across the courtyard. The boy spins his marble again and again and the other childs interest for the marble is growing minute by minute. Suddenly something happens... It is a short film about observing a moment and following its interests.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/au9yt47Me1PzGvCPLoeU7ZlaoME.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":73113,"logo_path":null,"name":"Filmakademie Wien","origin_country":"AT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"}],"release_date":"2008-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Marble","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
