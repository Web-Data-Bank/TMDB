Mihai Dumitru, Oana’s younger brother, worrying about the preparations of his anniversary and not realizing how inappropriate his demands are, is stuck in a story far bigger than what he can handle. Septimiu Pfifer, Oana’s husband, concerned about his health regarding a possible Covid-19 contamination, is vaguely listening to a strange story his ambulance colleague was caught inside long ago, while waiting for the next emergency call. Narcis Patranescu, an organized crime inspector, perturbed by the recent death of one of his colleagues, is on the grip of an unsettling dark story while interrogating a young woman during a funeral. Four short moments in time that are capturing the wanderings of a bunch of errant souls stuck at the crossroads of history.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iOWFcimxeYdEmAIv4S5P8uDxnE0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":13407,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mandragora","origin_country":"RO"},{"id":176827,"logo_path":null,"name":"2DB Films Studio","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RO","name":"Romania"}],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":200,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Romanian","iso_639_1":"ro","name":"Română"}],"status":"Post Production","tagline":"","title":"Mmxx","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
