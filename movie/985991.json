Living with a stammer, he is finding his way in a world ruled by vicious vowels, confusing consonants, and let’s not forget the biggest beast of them all – small talk.  A comic book hero of Sonny’s own creation helps him to soar above his bleak reality – but language is power and Sonny must find a way to be heard. When cast in the school production of Hamlet by the Headteacher, he soon finds the real heroes are closer than he thinks.  Dive head-first into the wondrous and heartbreaking Wonder Boy, written by the “fresh and fearless” (Evening Standard) Ross Willis (Wolfie) and directed by the Olivier-award winning Sally Cookson (A Monster Calls).","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/uUAMiVgdLU5CGI0pqfCDSDxpdTp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wonder Boy","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
