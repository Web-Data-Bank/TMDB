There was a fort that was set on fire by Indians shortly thereafter. Later, the turbulent expansion of a settlement began, which became a center for the immigrant workforce, traditional industry, the slaughterhouses (Bert Brecht) and, in 1941, armaments for war. The Windy City on Lake Michigan is the fastest changing city in the world.  The 35mm Arriflex film time-lapse footage is annotated with classic techno cuts and information about the tunnels under Chicago, the slaughterhouses, organized crime, Sears & Roebuck catalogs and other peculiarities of this strange city.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/78FBcLwUzozMAAaQyEP9WM8YKKk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1996-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":17,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Chicago Im Zeitraffer","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
