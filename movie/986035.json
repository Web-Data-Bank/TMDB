The Honda driver becomes the first privateer to win the championship since 1991, and this official review tells the story of how he finally managed to pull it off! This year's BTCC title chase was certainly not cut and dry from the beginning - Dan Eaves became the first driver to win three races in one day at Thruxton, while 2003 champion Yvan Muller was nipping at Neal's heels throughout the season taking five victories, closely followed by the 2001 title holder Jason Plato. It was all to play for as they neared the final round at Brands Hatch and we don√çt miss a second!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":225,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"BTCC 2005 Review","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
