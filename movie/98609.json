The obsession of the old marquis is centered on getting in touch with the most illustrious surnames, to ascend socially and to resume the pomp and courtly life that his family lost a long time ago. To this end, he decides to move into an old palace he owns, located in the center of the capital, but not before overcoming the difficulties posed by his wife, who deeply hates both her husband and her son. To regain control of the palace, the Marquis of Leguineche tries to handicap his wife, arguing an incurable mental illness, and then undertake a reform of the place in order to adapt it to aristocratic life.","popularity":2.194,"poster_path":"/ggtpWtXpuCGY2B5yoShkOwuy4Ig.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4808,"logo_path":null,"name":"Incine","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":52105,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jet Films","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"release_date":"1981-03-26","revenue":0,"runtime":112,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"National Heritage","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":22}
