Nicola Bellucci tells the extraordinary story of Wolfgang Fasser, a blind musician and soundscape artist who works with severely handicapped children, helping them to find their place in a world not made for them. On his own way into the darkness, Fasser discovered the world of sounds, a parallel universe to our visual world. His far-reaching explorations of sound’s effect on mind and body led him to the field of music therapy.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1WKgIZeMI6qVftY1PEcTdNibJES.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42145,"logo_path":"/fX8uY3tXWh814PLVqKM0IJEoDPW.png","name":"SRF","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":53569,"logo_path":null,"name":"soap factory","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":182724,"logo_path":null,"name":"RSI Radiotelevisione svizzera","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2010-10-28","revenue":0,"runtime":84,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"In the Garden of Sounds","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
