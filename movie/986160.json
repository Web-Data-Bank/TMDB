Gamelan music, wayang (shadow puppet) theater, dance, and elaborately constructed offerings of foods and flowers all represent attempts to please the gods and placate demons. In Balinese cosmology, demons are thought to dwell in the watery underworld, gods in the upper world, and human beings in the middle realm between the two. Much of human effort is directed toward maintaining the proper balance between these worlds, and between the forces of growth and decay.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hpLIdyDiLGNDi6mEzsakuL7BVg4.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1981-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":59,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Three Worlds of Bali","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
