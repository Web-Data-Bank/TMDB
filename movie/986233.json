It’s 1941. He is an occupying German soldier and clarinettist. She is a young French-Czech pianist. When the post-war authorities declare ‘No marriage between enemies!’ who can help the young lovers? Enter Emile: part Emcee, part guardian angel.  Leonore 40/45 is an opera written by Rolf Liebermann, Swiss composer and former artistic director of the Paris Opera. The style of the opera belongs to the 1950s, rooted in the 12-tone tradition of Schoenberg and Berg but lightened by lyric interludes and ‘semiseria’ sending up.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cL9YEkCtJqaIbNNEaBCmEheVrcC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-05-27","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Leonore 40/45","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
