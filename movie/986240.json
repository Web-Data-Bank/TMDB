The dialogue and narration have been reconfigured considerably, with some of the speakers being changed, but almost all of it is composed of words extracted from the original work. However, with the exception of Kindaichi, all the characters are played by women, the dialogue is almost barbed, and the clothing deviates slightly from what is appropriate to the situation, thus eliminating any sense of reality. The reason why Nanako's jumper and Washio's trousers were needed is not clear, as the murderer swims to Nanako's room in her clothes. In addition, Lieutenant Kamio's subordinate is simplified to only one detective, Aoki.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2020-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"華やかな野獣","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
