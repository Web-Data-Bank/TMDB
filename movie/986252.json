He’s assigned to a death scene investigation by YAN where the deceased, YUNG’s body had laid undiscovered for eight years, and only recently discovered by maintenance workers during the renovation of an old block of flat. CHOI looks into CHAO as the prime suspect, and linking it to adultery with YUNG’s widow PING as an accomplice. The case soon comes under scrutiny by a high-ranking court prosecutor SANTOS. Under his inquiries, the investigator becomes the investigated, and CHOI’s actions fall under suspicion as all manner of inconsistencies come to light from his statement. YUNG was a man of many vices, with few crimes left untouched by his hand – rape, drug smuggling, blackmail and working alongside notorious gangster FAI WAI.","popularity":2.213,"poster_path":"/dZWdBV1Zsqlw21mQAtlAvaMm1Mx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":176883,"logo_path":null,"name":"Point of View Movie Production Co.
