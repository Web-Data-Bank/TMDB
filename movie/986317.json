Now in it’s 48th year, the competition has become one of motorsport’s biggest success stories. This season was jam-packed with all the high-drama typical of the BTCC, and the big teams like Halfords, SEAT Sport, VX Racing and Team RAC put forward some incredibly competitive machines. Both Jason Plato and Colin Turkington retained a mathematical chance of stealing Matt Neal’s crown up until the very last stage at Silverstone. This massive review brings four hours of highlights from Brands Hatch, Mondello Park, Oulton Park, Thruxton, Croft and Snetterton - plus extended highlights from two of the greatest BTCC races ever witnessed; the classic rounds at Knockhill and Donington Park! Featuring some footage not seen before on British TV. With the best driving from no less than 30 races this review is not to be missed!","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":240,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"BTCC 2006 Review","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
