We watch as women prepare the midday meal and do laundry in the river. Men hunt for alligators, paca and tapir in the forest as well as make handcrafts during a rainstorm. Children play and help with chores such as fruit-gathering and fishing, with adults showing them the right way to do things. Through intimate, interwoven images, the video gives us a vivid sense of the daily pattern in this village.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2003-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":41,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kinja Iakaha, A Day in the Village","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
