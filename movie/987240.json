The depth and complexity of her lyrical and thematic choices, as well as the sophisticated mix of classical and soul influences on her style, all sprang from a woman who thoughtfully interrogated her role and identity throughout her life. Filmmaker Antonino D’Ambrosio has created a marvelous monument to a singular and unclassifiable musical genius, with commentary from contemporary artists whom she has inspired.","popularity":1.901,"poster_path":"/xWV67WKPt0iueuhRItmEpRnlCh1.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":201,"logo_path":"/6UIpEURdjnmcJPwgTDRzVRuwADr.png","name":"ARTE","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":92507,"logo_path":null,"name":"La Lutta NMC","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-11-17","revenue":0,"runtime":87,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Roberta","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":1}
