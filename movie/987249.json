Three concentration camps were situated just across the Slovenian-Italian border, and this is also where a new concentration camp - a detention center for migrants - was being built at the time of making this film. Further, the film discusses the issue of statelessness - by comparing everyday situations endured by the Roma people in Rome, Italy, and by the Erased people in Slovenia - they too were, and still often are, detained in Italian and Slovenian detention centers.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/dIIif5weI3Sa6iZp0swGqRu08D3.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"SI","name":"Slovenia"}],"release_date":"2005-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Slovenian","iso_639_1":"sl","name":"Slovenščina"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"On the Other Side of the River","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
