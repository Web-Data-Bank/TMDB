During the pandemic, starting from the first lockdown, La Trape gave life to a series of videos and directed on her Instagram profile, performing inside her private home, in her room, and working on the border between the drag performance and the parody of tutorials. Going to redefine not only the places of expression of his work (from the club to his home), but also the roles and relational relationships at play in a post-media economy, Trapezia moves between antithetical tensions, poised between expressive and performative impulses that they turn outwards and the need to protect - and reclaim - their vulnerability.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cjGZNVmLgMjinG6cK1FmGOgsQEx.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":19,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Trapezia","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
