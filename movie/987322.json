Its central theme concerns the predetermined beauty standards which are imposed by the western society on women. A fundamental aesthetic and thematic purpose of the film is the provocation of intense, disturbing and shocking feelings through the graphic images, the inconvenient sounds and the audiovisual repetitions.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/epZAjya9eZuLpLhGoXDN4c2V8TO.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":178474,"logo_path":"/AvEu3FUJOiul65MTD74MQmQckQi.png","name":"Film School of the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki","origin_country":"GR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GR","name":"Greece"}],"release_date":"2022-05-21","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Dollhouse","video":false,"vote_average":8.0,"vote_count":1}
