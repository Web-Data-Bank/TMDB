A farewell. It’s not the goodbye that hurts. It’s the fact that I can’t do anything for you anymore. No matter how much I cry in pain, I can’t see you. No matter how much I resist the yearning, I can’t feel you. I picture you shivering in fear in a different world. Yet, there’s nothing I can do for you. That hurts. It really hurts.  I want to console you. And me. I want to be consoled.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/etR3sFeKjmnMJydjW8tVrrv50LP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":126468,"logo_path":"/bPL10u0CNVqmSovalrbcZiwWvre.png","name":"Content Zium","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"release_date":"2022-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Be in My Dream","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
