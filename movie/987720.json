Фильм первый","overview":"The young family did not stay in this status for long: Vitya and Ilona notice only flaws in each other, constantly swear and, in the end, get divorced. From their once happy family, only an apartment bought with a mortgage remained, which is difficult to sell due to redevelopment. In fact, the frivolous Vitya and Ilona did not have time to really study each other: they got married almost immediately after they met and then got an ill-fated apartment, and now they don’t know what to do. There is an apartment, there are no feelings ... it seems that the main intrigue is only what will happen first: the sale of a problem apartment, or the former spouses will finally finish each other within four walls.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/o5uX5pKzVVMsC2jqdGSW2O9Ktqe.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32379,"logo_path":"/nagNIYAu5DwvH2n4fuBmBp5cMZx.png","name":"Comedy Club Production","origin_country":"RU"},{"id":110827,"logo_path":"/psP4OUGGE90zKZoW5nSv7lOaTHI.png","name":"TNT","origin_country":"RU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"RU","name":"Russia"}],"release_date":"2022-06-30","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Divorce.
