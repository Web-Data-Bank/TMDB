Owen has been banned from most of the mainstream platforms and services for being unafraid to voice his opinions on a wide range of topics, but the politically correct censors couldn't stop him from building a community. The Bears seek to bypass the degeneracy of modern society and answer the question of \"now what?\". It is about growing and self-sustainability - no matter the scale. This documentary focuses on how a crowd-funded project starts taking shape: the building of cabins on undeveloped land in Northern Idaho. It highlights people who are united in their goal of creating a place where they can get together and have fun.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9xzdMkcsieZni8jXatMBQDu78tF.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2021-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"Building Beartaria: an inspiring story in 2021","title":"Building Beartaria Beartaria Rises","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
