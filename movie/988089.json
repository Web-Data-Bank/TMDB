He does it on a bicycle - on his first bike journey ever. With the question \"What makes you happy\", but without experience in bike traveling, the 24-year-old from Germany jumps into the deep end and simply sets off - always heading east. He's traveling alone, but he's rarely lonely: many encounters with interesting, crazy or \"completely normal\" people give him insights that ordinary tourists rarely experience. While others like a well-structured all inclusive tour, this bike tour is a journey into uncertainty. But in the uncertainty hides the biggest adventure - Dennis gradually becomes aware of this.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Home2Home","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
