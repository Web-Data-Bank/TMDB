Its members, namely team captain Yana Vynokurova and coach Karina Kulakovska, were able to reinvent the team after they were disqualified from the Premier Football League, because the former leadership of the team has violated the rules. In 2018, at the time of filming, the goal of the team was to return to the Premier League on their own, without the former leadership. The women were able to find training facilities, attract new team members, and find money for props, salaries and travel expenses.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gNB7kN5w5eFJp5s5FeFoBZHsT4y.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":23,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Mariupolchanka","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
