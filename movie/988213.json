Shot over a two-day weekend in a studio transformed into a multi-sensory dystopian universe, The Onyx Experience tells the story of rise, rebellion and rumination with electrifying performances from Fefe Dobson, The OBGMs and SATE. Simultaneously on the verge and on the edge. Equal parts innovator and outcast. Gathered in one space to celebrate each other, shine a light on one another, and remind each other that in this fast paced, amnesiac world, we do and have always existed.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/g7mPTsEEBuU9CIAmmrV7KUqCbtv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-09","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Onyx Experience","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
