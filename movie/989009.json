The storyline shuttles from Incheon to Daegu, where the social-activist priest Jang does his best to help the immigrants with their claims for compensation, severance pay and employment rights. Fine, eye-opening stuff, rather well acted by the non-pro cast – which includes Choi himself.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2011-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":36,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Even No Shadow","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
