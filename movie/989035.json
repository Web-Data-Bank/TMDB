The film was supposed to be shown while he was playing his piece of music, he didn't want to be seen. The film shows Frederic Rzewski sitting down at the table in the Trattoria Carlone in the Trastevere district of Rome from a bird's eye view. He orders wine, salad and a portion of spaghetti. We watch as he eats, pays, gets up and walks out of the picture.
