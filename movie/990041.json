A recent move back to its edges sees Benson re-imagining the arid climate's texture of feldspar, sand, creosote and deep skies with layers of no-input feedback, digital paint, misbehaving color effects and camera-driven image distortion. Shot in one long take using custom real-time video software, \"Deserted\" places a geological history within a context both synthesized and electronic to its core.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6UfSEvoLGrhfOrYPateNN2d3beM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":10,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Deserted","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
