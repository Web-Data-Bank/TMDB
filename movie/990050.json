It will last Jacopo’s lifetime. Jacopo Baboni Schilingi wears a special device conceived to measure his breathing 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, based on technology developed by David Kuller (through his company My Air). A dedicated computer and algorithm constantly monitor the incoming data: the length of Jacopo’s breaths, total volume of his last 10 seconds to 1 minute of breathing, breath rate, rib cage expansion and compression, etc. The data transmitted and interpreted live from the device, creates a symbiosis between technology and the most fundamental, intimate process of a human’s life: breathing. For the first time, this device allows us to witness and comprehend an existential version of the present. Converting this into semantic functions, it generates endless music.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/lskDdY8qTEnAnXYRJYhidmPPDWe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Argo","video":false,"vote_average":6.0,"vote_count":1}
