Taking Wire’s 154 album cover artwork as an inspiration, the recurring motif of a DNA double helix twist references ranging from the geometric abstraction of Bridget Riley, Josef Albers and Frank Stella to the playful and irreverent British post-punk music packaging of Barney Bubbles and Peter Saville. Ultimately, it's acid flashbacks from a specific pivotal continuum in visual culture, processed through Sodeoka's distinctive feedback complexity.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/xvyypLywXvlFCHa8oCUfEdJXAff.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Exponential Functions 154","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
