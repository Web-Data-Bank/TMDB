As Brexit takes grip and fear against immigrates rises, an imported Indian bride, Simmy, discovers her British Asian husband, Raj, has run away on their wedding night. Her community conscious mother-in-law, Gurbaksh, traps the new bride in the house, to uphold their Izzat (honour). All is unwell, until the younger wayward son, Harry, arrives home from prison on licence. A secret love story starts to unfold, and the two inmates escape to the Slough countryside. As family secrets come to a head, the family have to let go of the past and cultural expectations.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/auy51VFtxHODy1iODd6r4IGv4Wi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":142572,"logo_path":null,"name":"Resource Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"2022-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Little English","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
