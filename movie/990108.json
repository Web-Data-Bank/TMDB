Holding the location in high regard, Meier praises the vibrant visual layout of the city and tells us, \"Rome is a city of architecture; it's a city of walls and columns and spaces and places and defined places and wherever you look there's architecture\" (Richard Meier). Staying true to his signature design style, Meier has created a structure resembling grand soaring sails which appear steady and peaceful as they stand in striking opposition to the city's landscape. Three curved walls separate three distinct spaces: the main sanctuary, the weekday chapel and the baptistry, each with its own entrance. As a contrast he shows us his favorite churches in Rome by his famous colleagues from earlier times.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hWW5BBUtwXy1006rZxc48N6luB4.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70445,"logo_path":null,"name":"Michael Blackwood Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2006-01-19","revenue":0,"runtime":58,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Richard Meier in Rome Building a Church in the City of Churches","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
