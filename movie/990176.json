From the chaotic concert at the Salle Vallier in Marseille in 1966, to the recording of \"Exile on Main Street\", their album written under the influence in a villa on the Côte d'Azur, to Mick Jagger's mythical wedding in Saint-Tropez, the British rock band has lived through some crazy French years. Never-before-seen images and interviews with collaborators, rock critics and musicians lift the veil on the Stones' passionate relationship with France.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/6gcZof0oqJ4Xgr2MDemRvDaIC2x.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":88002,"logo_path":"/zV5SSl4WlW9Dh63M9dqhZiEPRCF.png","name":"Bangumi","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/eLvjHPYZ12GR58lrDgg6MXZp2a3.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2022-06-20","revenue":0,"runtime":86,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"L'histoire française des Rolling Stones","video":false,"vote_average":9.0,"vote_count":2}
