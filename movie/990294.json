Place where memory and oblivion fragments are deposited.\r Poetic documentary that talks about the birth and decay of the physical body of the films. This documentary rescues the beauty of celulloid films, in the form of digitalized fragments of many formats made with nitrate, acetate and polyester. It’s a song about memory, memories, forgetfulness and human evocation.  Our mirrors: the moving images that erode to the extent of becoming dust.
