Within the confines of the school, we witness a twisted version of a coming of age story of unbridled violence in the name of law and order, culminating tragically to the death of the bullied Dickhead. As the incident escalates and things go astray, Smoker faces a moral dilemma: Should he clear himself of further corruption, or should he act as an accomplice of the authorities? Stylistically extravagant, the short uses the secondary school as a metaphor to underpin the absurdity and brutality in ‘the worst of times.’","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/valFa8VRabdyWpxmbXbZmveeVgb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":30,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Anatomy of Rats","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
