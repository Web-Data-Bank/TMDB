With the passage of time, the big clan becomes fragmented as members, like other modern Chinese in mainland China, face changes in lives, ideals, and family structures. The occasion becomes a hot ground for deals and negotiations that are inevitable amid the rapid development of China, where family members prosper while relationships become calculated. Still, a funeral procession amid an impending storm requires them, already down different paths, to walk together.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/zvCPk0WuFhOLOJCsUEMd5VuiDfk.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-06-18","revenue":0,"runtime":22,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Walk with the Storm","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
