When he is done with his shift, he goes home to his wife and children and has dinner.  His waves of violence penetrate the family unit.  His destruction is felt for miles and miles, at the dinner table to places far away that he will be forever linked to in the minds and hearts of those he hurts.  His children feel the vibrations.  They know.  But they are also his children so there is heroism involved and desire to be loved.  The drone operator is also lonely, because he is not on the ground with other military persons who understand the pain of the violence they are connected to, and there is little support for him, although he may not think he needs it.\r - http://www.dynastyhandbag.com","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/6r4o4UqQFn8uN0mOoQ402Bj8Gve.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2013-06-21","revenue":0,"runtime":7,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Remote Penetration / Stain of History","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
