If you've never seen any demos on the C16 and Plus/4 then you are in for a treat! They are very similar in style to Commodore 64 demos but some feature additional colours and effects not possible even on the mighty C64! Also, a SID card has been used for the recordings of these demos so you can enjoy the productions with REAL SID Music! As an extra bonus the DVD contains a picture gallery of Commodore 16 and Plus 4 demoscene graphics.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/k22IdGLXClMsER5Pa7PjR0jt8Ae.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2005-05-02","revenue":0,"runtime":125,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"We Are Family: Commodore 16 and Plus/4 Demoscene Collection","video":true,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
