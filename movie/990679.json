Thrash Metal","overview":"Throughout history, the San Francisco Bay Area has long been named as the epicenter for \"Thrash Metal;\" whereas Los Angeles is invariably considered the \"Hair-Metal\" capitol. True, San Francisco has birthed many exceptional thrash bands since the early '80s, but the fact is LA is the birthplace of three out of the \"Big 4\" thrash bands as well as the breeding grounds for many of the more unconventional speed/thrash/punk-metal bands. Whether it'd be the legendary icons METALLICA, SLAYER, and MEGADETH, or punk/metal renegades SUICIDAL TENDENCIES, or underground thrash legends DARK ANGEL and HIRAX, like it or not, they all originated from this pretentious, megalopolis, hellhole we call Los Angeles.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gXYA74eA7PMlzYaqFRAwsEW1PxA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-06-01","revenue":0,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Inside Metal: The Rise of L.A.
