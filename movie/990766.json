Years later, a senile, demented WONG, who keeps blabbering about his ‘groundbreaking’ debut, is being taken care of by his grudging son Ho. The film parodies the visual style of the Shaw Brothers martial arts films to tell the story of a contemporary father-and-son conflict and reconciliation. Golden Sword Woman travels in time and between both sides of the silver screen, between the romantic world of swordsmen and the unpromising, secular family life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/92YFVGIvKYhylTiyCi96Y8tHoZv.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"HK","name":"Hong Kong"}],"release_date":"2022-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":27,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Cantonese","iso_639_1":"cn","name":"广州话 / 廣州話"},{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Golden Sword Woman","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
