Through logical reasoning and analysis, the film shows clearly that a government-directed \"drama\" and self-immolation occurred to resolve a situation in which Jiang Zemin, then leader of the Chinese Communist Party, was \"in a difficult position\" to suppress Falun Gong. In addition, the film tells the story of how Falun Gong practitioners came out one by one to tell the truth, but were brutally persecuted by the Chinese Communist Party and tortured to death, but they did not give in and insisted on telling people the truth in a peaceful and rational manner. This spirit of perseverance and resilience in spite of life and death shook the audience to their core.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/jMaZ9KgHUmvQ8MNnQxfQlxhN37E.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":177528,"logo_path":null,"name":"Deerpark Studio","origin_country":""},{"id":177529,"logo_path":null,"name":"OH Documentary","origin_country":""},{"id":177530,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sound of Hope","origin_country":""},{"id":177531,"logo_path":null,"name":"New Tang Dynasty Television","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"TW","name":"Taiwan"}],"release_date":"2019-01-20","revenue":0,"runtime":85,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"False Fire: China's Tragic New Standard In State Deception","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
