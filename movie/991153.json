The \"strong men\" of the community is a group determined to solve the problem themselves, by offering positive role models and beneficial activities to the young people. In this documentary, we see these leaders take young people away from the township to experience traditional hunting and living, and to hear the stories of their elders.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/9N9xSiTE8Masuv5UTOAVBd6dpPb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"release_date":"2007-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":24,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Strong Men Of Nguiu","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
