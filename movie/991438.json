Nso’ is the biggest Kingdom of the Western Grassfields and an ethnic group in the northeast corner of Cameroon’s North West region. Its capital Kumbo is where the ruler (Fon) lives. The Nso’ population counts Christians, Muslims, and followers of “indigenous” religious beliefs. This film shows what a thing, a nut or a natural resource, can mean to people. Kola nut is an item around which the feeling, experience, sense, and lived “reality” of belonging, togetherness, being together, unity, oneness, friendship and peace is being expressed. The kola nut thus plays an important role in bringing very diverse people together, irrespective of their religion, village, quarter, or thoughts. In this sense, kola nut brings about a feeling of togetherness, fellowship, and belonging to a group.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/kcTe05xuB1fua3VClmyU9JRDd1l.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CM","name":"Cameroon"}],"release_date":"2013-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":39,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Together as One","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
