But the one who, without any doubt, knew how to give him his letters of nobility on the big screen was Pierre Richard who interpreted seven times the characters of Perrin and Pignon. Two cult characters from the imagination of the famous director and screenwriter Francis Veber. For 15 years, the collaboration of the Pierre Richard-Francis Veber duo offered huge public and popular successes that have stood the test of time and entered the pantheon of the greatest French comedies.","popularity":0.712,"poster_path":"/csG9vDkzfmwfy8b8WAjcNInRRcd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-09-12","revenue":0,"runtime":65,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pierre Richard... en mode Veber","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
