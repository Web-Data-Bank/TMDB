And there are no known faces at least in the lead roles. With a lesser known star cast and a new theme, actor Abhishek manages to render a thriller in his maiden directorial venture that is interesting to watch.  The 'Mogamul' man, who later established himself as a successful small screen actor, deserves a pat on the back for coming out with a script without clichs. However, one could not avoid the impression that the film could have been better had he infused more pace in it.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":140,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Kadhai","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
