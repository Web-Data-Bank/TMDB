The narrative explores the common asexual experience of feeling different than most of the population, and the isolation, confusion, and self-loathing that difference can create. However, the story also emphasizes the self-love and joy that can come from recognition of one's asexuality and the asexual community, and how it's possible to embrace the orientation by viewing it in a different light.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qESZota49RroCrLXM0Fr8wgzgqM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-07-02","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Embrace","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
