Percy (Edward Flanagan) and Ferdie (Neely Edwards) buy themselves a couple of cowboy suits, then head out west. They flirt with the pretty bar maids, knock out the local banditos with golf balls and play some poker. It's slight, low-key and amusing.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":177792,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hall Room Boys Photoplays","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"1919-12-15","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Taming the West","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
