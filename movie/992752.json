Actually, Aniâ€™s main reason for taking the job in the city is the hope that she will somehow meet up with Rudy (James Sahertian), a childhood friend. At the karaoke club, Ani attracts unwanted affections from the owner, Robert (Torro Margens). Ani escapes this dilemma when she does, finally, find Rudy. Together, they set up a small business selling ready-made clothes.  Robert refuses to give up. He sends some men to beat up Rudy, and even assigns  Susana to try to break up Rudy and Ani. Susana is successful. Ani then goes to work with Prasetyo (Willy Dozan), whom she met when she was in the garment business. The relationship between Ani and Prasetyo becomes serious, and they marry. However, Rudy, who is living with Susana, attempts to blackmail Ani with his knowledge of her past involvement with the karaoke club.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":177824,"logo_path":null,"name":"Konsorsium PPFI","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"1994-10-13","revenue":0,"runtime":94,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Surgaku Nerakaku","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
