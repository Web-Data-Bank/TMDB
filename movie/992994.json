It features seven different pairings, whose members speak periodically with Loshak, one-to-one, to explain their points of view. Their conversations extend over the war's first three months, during which time their opinions evidence no change. The film makes no attempt at dialogue -- on the contrary, it is a testimony to the absence of dialogue amidst an unfolding war, and an unsentimental diagnosis of the sickness of a society in which official propaganda proves stronger than even the most intimate family ties.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rYTcqhXfDk1hxqgD26EMvuVlwDc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":111158,"logo_path":"/9m4vqLnfjoPeyJteUmi2LZQDJ1c.png","name":"Current Time TV","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GE","name":"Georgia"},{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"}],"release_date":"2022-06-19","revenue":0,"runtime":98,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Russian","iso_639_1":"ru","name":"Pусский"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Broken Ties","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
