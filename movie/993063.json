The course of South African history was changed by the assassin, Dimitri Tsafendas, who was written off as mad and condemned to twenty-eight years of imprisonment.  A Question of Madness tells the extraordinary human story of a man, born of a black mother, but classified white, who travelled the world in hopeless search of sanctuary - eventually returning to the land of apartheid to wreak vengeance on the one who symbolized the racism which had haunted his life.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/yAakdq5hv7ax0PvOiA5v5Y3D6sV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":448,"logo_path":null,"name":"Key Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1999-11-11","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Afrikaans","iso_639_1":"af","name":"Afrikaans"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Question of Madness: The Furiousus","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
