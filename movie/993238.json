She also supports her lazy husband Masaya, who has no qualms about giving her a few slaps, particularly after he loses his job. What chance does this young family have to scrape their way out of the social mire, where they were driven by poverty and the imprudence of youth? How dark does reality have to get before it stifles the rays of hope that filter through? An intimate story that presents a less glitzy picture of Japan than is customary, demonstrating that social inequality impacts all corners of the globe.","popularity":14.921,"poster_path":"/ju3y7sY98WSSlqdp0xPBQgkxAgG.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":142264,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rabbit House","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"release_date":"2023-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":128,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Far Shore","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
