The sentence is made harsher because the prosecutor, Hasan, discriminates more on Tohir’s lineage than his crime. But in fact, Tohir commits his crime out of necessity as his wife is pregnant and about to give birth. He is sentenced to hard labor in exile so when he finds out that his wife and child are dead, Tohir escapes and kidnaps Hasan’s son, Husin. He raises the son in a life of crime, but lives like a respectable man. Husin also lives a double life. He is loved by an innocent girl in the village, but in other places, he plays around with women. In his old age, Tohir becomes a drunk and then he finds out that the government has awarded Hasan for his services. He uses Husin, nicknamed Boy, to avenge himself by sending him to rob Hasan’s house. Husin fails and is sent to trial. There, while drunk, Tohir reveals who Husin really is. Hasan and his wife then welcome Husin back.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/j3AtB7rUsJMRwcYAuOFFc4atKtK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":151478,"logo_path":null,"name":"PT Dipa Jaya Film","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"1972-06-29","revenue":0,"runtime":0,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Lingkaran Setan","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
