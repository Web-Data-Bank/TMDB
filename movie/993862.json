The clip is of a family hiding behind a wall in a neighbourhood in Beirut, Lebanon. The neighbourhood has become a warzone. Over time the compressed video is slowed down, enlarged, and gets a new soundscape. Additional dimensions are revealed in the scene, and a troubling contrast between imagery and content is created, leading to an anxiously destabilising affect in the viewer.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/hwSsZkaSoF1BrSbGP1agZrvdUxV.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Excerpt","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
