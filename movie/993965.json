At the same time as the US was spearheading the Nuremberg trial of a similar Nazi experimental apparatus. Psychic submission, mental manipulation, brainwashing, irradiation, administration of toxic substances administered to guinea pigs recruited from among America's underprivileged, prisoners, the sick and orphans. The aim of the manoeuvre: to refine the techniques of psychological warfare, anti-atomic defence, interrogation... and to manufacture a human machine ready to kill. President Clinton made a public apology in 1995, acknowledging the existence of these secret programmes following a resounding commission of enquiry.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/ckzSC3kgKQ2OhB8vZ2up5sdNgde.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-06-10","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Les cobayes de la CIA","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
