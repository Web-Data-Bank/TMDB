It’s like a miniature remake of \"Rear Window\", but a New York version – Rear Window as seen by a minimalist artist from New York. The window takes up almost the entire frame, the photographer is nowhere to be seen and the gaze, no longer voyeuristic, flutters over the surface of a red brick façade on the other side, studded by myriad identical windows. On the surface of the windows or in the depths of the bedrooms, life passes by, takes its leave and returns, always inaccessible.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/bAi16Ij5qAB1PKhBzLATje46DPz.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":18,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Welcome","video":false,"vote_average":9.25,"vote_count":3}
