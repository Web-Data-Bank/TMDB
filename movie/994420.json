Today LGBT people are far more likely than any other minority group in the United States to be victimized by violent hate crimes. PUZZLES tells the story of a hate crime in a gay bar called Puzzles Lounge in New Bedford, MA when a teenager entered and brutally attacked its patrons. As a result two different worlds collide, a homophobic hate crime offender and his victims. Puzzles explores the correlation between American economic desperation and homophobia, intolerance, and, ultimately, violence.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/qvjqM7y5qZbPSpL5v3VHR6f7kvB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2012-06-22","revenue":0,"runtime":53,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Puzzles","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
