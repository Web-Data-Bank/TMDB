Demonstrating both formal and narrative freedom, BÃ©langer weaves a deliberately loose weave in which the initiatory journey of two young people, wandering through Montreal in search of a job, unfolds. But not just any job. The two idealists want a job that will satisfy their desire for freedom, peace and respect. Of course, even though the breath of renewal from Expo 67 still floats here and there, the world they encounter does not correspond - by far - to their aspirations. Strangers in this country that tells them nothing, they come across brutally, materialism, violence, and egocentrism.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1971-10-26","revenue":0,"runtime":82,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ty-Peupe","video":false,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1}
