Using repurposed church buildings as the theater and everyday events as the play, we take a step back and observe humanity's absurd ways of dealing with life. From hardcore parties to yoga sessions, and from a morning mass to a gym. Hopeful coping-mechanisms we use to escape the emptiness of life. Captured within the walls of that which used to provide us with fixed frames of reference and collective meaning: the church.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/i40tJADqbVvf1DIeo7VhvAwanQZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"NL","name":"Netherlands"}],"release_date":"2022-07-07","revenue":0,"runtime":11,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How shall we comfort ourselves.","video":false,"vote_average":10.0,"vote_count":1}
