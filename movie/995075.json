In 1974, the building was demolished.  One morning, just before the demolition crew moved in, I set up my Bolex and shot 100' of the mural before it was completely destroyed, and here it is. The film is silent; the light is all natural; the film is Ektachrome Reversal 7241, a really beautiful daylight film stock - 2.5 minutes of contemplation.\" - WWD","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1974-06-02","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Gaze","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
