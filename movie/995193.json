Tamogami takes pity on Yuri-chan, who is struggling with her view count, and begins to help her with her YouTube channel without asking for anything in return, as if he were a \"god. Despite the fact that the number of subscribers is slow to increase, they work hard to stay positive and become good partners. One day, through the introduction of Tamogami's colleague Umekawa (Tatsuya Wakaba), Yuri-chan meets popular YouTubers Chorey and Kabigon (Kaito Yoshimura and Awari), and their \"physical\" collaboration video suddenly gets a lot of buzz. Yuri-chan also met handsome designer Allen Murakami (Shuntaro Yanagi), and quickly became one of the most popular YouTubers. Tamogami, on the other hand, does his best to help her, but his videos are lame. He is a nice guy, but he has no sense of style...
