The wages are poor and the cost of living is on the rise. Abu Deya, a Palestinian Jordanian, wants to provide a different life for his family, but a criminal record stymies his efforts. Alex Sardà’s observational film sensitively documents one man's relationship to his family, the land and its laws. Ultimately, it questions the possibility of exorcising the past in a society that seems opposed to the notion of rehabilitation.","popularity":4.895,"poster_path":"/xERsnRlp4bTZ2Rq2hNFFe5fUbCf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-05-19","revenue":0,"runtime":78,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Hafreiat","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
