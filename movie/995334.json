Their first and only record was banned by the country’s racist legal system and within a few years the group had disbanded. The two black members, brothers Punka and Gary Khoza, subsequently died tragically young. Eschewing talking heads for a dazzling audio-visual archive, including some great Super-8 footage, debut director Neff has forged a visceral portrait of a dissident group who were dedicated to the fight for racial freedom – a punk legacy that lives on through the band’s legend and its fans.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/sDxZ0HQSe2iLNQLKuer9GBLZoVI.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2022-06-26","revenue":0,"runtime":66,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"This is National Wake","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
