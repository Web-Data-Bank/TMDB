She and her agent Amy have a plan. The two carefully planned a hype event, and used Wang Hao, a fan who was too delusional about An Qi, to get rid of it after successfully hyping it up. From the exposure of the indecent video at the film conference, to An Qi's move and arranging for Wang Hao to take care of her, all plans are going smoothly. Finally, one night, An Qi and her neighbors were attacked one after another, and the situation was serious. After the police took away Wang Hao who attacked An Qi, An Qi and Amy quarreled about whether to turn themselves in. Amy unexpectedly discovered that someone had been spying on An Qi, and that someone else was behind the attack on the neighbor.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/cWlbPYUp2oYUdN5ajQap7wthDRa.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2016-06-24","revenue":0,"runtime":72,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Tou kui zhe","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
