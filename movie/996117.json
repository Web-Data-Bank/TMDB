A charitable woman hands him a calling card to the future; a hostile ex unleashes a public humiliation; a new love interest suddenly whisks him off his feet. Odd coincidences segue through dream logic, patching together scenes from his past while hinting at his fate. Enigmatic signs lead him to an eccentric hypnotherapist to address his fleeting grip on reality, but it may be too late. This incredibly imaginative film explores ideas of memory, identity and time as powerful yet dangerously fragile constructs, often beyond our simple ken. Ingeniously playing with time and space, Imaginur poses bold questions about existence with stunning cinematic bravado.","popularity":1.503,"poster_path":"/8GDAe9i6HiFtRB1O5nCbUcGH4j0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109559,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lumatic Films","origin_country":"MY"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MY","name":"Malaysia"}],"release_date":"2023-02-23","revenue":500000,"runtime":90,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Malay","iso_639_1":"ms","name":"Bahasa melayu"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Imaginur","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
