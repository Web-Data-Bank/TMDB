The train pulls up and attendants help passengers off and on. This was not in the Lumière's official catalog, and was likely screened in early 1896. This film is often misidentified on Youtube as \"L'Arrivée d’un train à La Ciotat\", which is the title of the 1897 remake.","popularity":0.677,"poster_path":"/wDpJled2s1T7Cfv2nJawMWGky82.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11793,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lumière","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"1896-01-25","revenue":0,"runtime":1,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"No Language","iso_639_1":"xx","name":"No Language"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Train Pulling into a Station","video":false,"vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":19}
