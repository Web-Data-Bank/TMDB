He stalks his prey, abducts them, and then torments them until he has grown tired of them. There is no dungeon, in the classic sense, but rather a domestic setting where he carries out his sadistic plan on his unsuspecting victims. This time he has set his sights on a young and sexy woman named Victoria. She lives alone, keeps a low profile, and stays to herself, which makes for the perfect prey for him. He spends days watching her, and keeping meticulous notes about her comings and goings. He waits for the perfect time to close the deal, and when he does, Victoria has no idea what has happened, nor does she understand his twisted mind. His reality is skewed, and it\\'s clear that this will not bode well for her, no matter how much she tries to play his games.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/4IvHZIu5virw5txyGve1GeixZRy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6121,"logo_path":"/1haoAABwAdQcRT3DjV2thb33XG9.png","name":"Digital Sin","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2022-02-03","revenue":0,"runtime":143,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Diary Of A Madman","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
