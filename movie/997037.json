Maestro Nathalie Stutzmann makes her Met debut conducting a star-studded cast led by baritone Peter Mattei as a magnetic Don Giovanni, alongside the Leporello of bass-baritone Adam Plachetka. Sopranos Federica Lombardi, Ana María Martínez, and Ying Fang make a superlative trio as Giovanni’s conquests—Donna Anna, Donna Elvira, and Zerlina—and tenor Ben Bliss is Don Ottavio.","popularity":7.916,"poster_path":"/anHb1dEVHcZn1PZYIYZcJPbqP9G.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2023-05-20","revenue":0,"runtime":195,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Metropolitan Opera: Don Giovanni","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
