The original material is a result of an intervalometer test of soft focus automotive headlights shot in the early 2000’s. In 2017, the footage was rediscovered and reworked into a composite of various arrangements engaging in the filmmakers preoccupation with abstraction. The audio arrangement is a collage of various found material which was originally recorded in the late 1960’s. As a whole, the work creates a spectrum of proximities.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/nwRBRXOZYVvbEUrI9g78C652H84.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2018-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Moons of Palaver","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
