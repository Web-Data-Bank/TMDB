In 2035 Indonesia is divided into two, the eastern part which still adheres to religion and the western part which removes religion. Religious activities are considered illegal and immoral in the west. Religion disappeared in no time. It all looks fine. But people's morals and hearts are broken and damaged because they rely on themselves to live. Among the people who begin to forget God, there are still those who fight for their religion which is called UNDERGROUND. This is their story.  This film was made as a religious lesson for Rayner and his friends in high school, 7 years ago.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/8SmwrUWeYI8G3K6kfNi4iYEt24X.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":178478,"logo_path":null,"name":"Rayvolution Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ID","name":"Indonesia"}],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Indonesian","iso_639_1":"id","name":"Bahasa indonesia"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"THERE IS NO GOD!","title":"Revelation","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
