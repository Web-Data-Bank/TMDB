An unsuspecting American tourist played by Eddie Stone travels to Europe for an adventure of a lifetime and ends up the victim of a mugging. With his passport, Euros and ID gone, Eddie is lured to the Italian castle by Joe Foster and soon finds out it is a sexual playground for gorgeous Italian men. A weekend of steamy encounters ends up with some hot twists and turns in the labyrinths of the grounds.  With a surprise ending, this is one story not soon to be forgotten. When the cast arrived at the location, they were informed that the castle was haunted by the gates keeper. The crew was kept on their toes all week by every noise and creak they heard. The ancient castle used for the set of When in Rome dates back to the 15th century and is built on a rock outcrop in a gorgeous Italian suburb between two enormous green valleys.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":6713,"logo_path":"/uyWmZThXlLhzj7L9RHEVDK5jTYP.png","name":"Rascal Video","origin_country":"US"},{"id":6473,"logo_path":"/jcTK9eIgnwOo9JTRGUrbexBZJrF.png","name":"Channel 1 Releasing","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"release_date":"2004-02-17","revenue":0,"runtime":120,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"When In Rome","video":false,"vote_average":7.0,"vote_count":1}
