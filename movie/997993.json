A Czech social anthropologist attempts to make a new home for herself here with her family whilst also researching social transformations in the local community. The loss of jobs in the mining industry, as well as the complicated relationship between Norwegian natives, foreign immigrants, and tourists all contribute to the city's change of atmosphere whilst the surrounding snowy mountains melt and avalanches threaten the daily existence of the local population. This portrait of the microcosm of an ice town is a raw glimpse into the contemporary globalized world.","popularity":0.744,"poster_path":"/8pjHAboRevUBiwB2a4a2RMu8Y0g.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":122386,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cinémotif Films","origin_country":"CZ"},{"id":84349,"logo_path":"/f5o98Qe4RKjwlhdSlkK2ZZf9JUi.png","name":"Ten Thousand Images","origin_country":"NO"},{"id":29735,"logo_path":"/yYUMjj0QfqfzuP8gvPe9xiUZJg7.png","name":"Peter Kerekes","origin_country":"SK"},{"id":487,"logo_path":"/x3BUIowxU2skXOpnOeOkl7kIYDo.png","name":"Česká televize","origin_country":"CZ"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CZ","name":"Czech Republic"},{"iso_3166_1":"NO","name":"Norway"},{"iso_3166_1":"SK","name":"Slovakia"}],"release_date":"2023-03-24","revenue":0,"runtime":83,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"},{"english_name":"Norwegian","iso_639_1":"no","name":"Norsk"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"The Visitors","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
