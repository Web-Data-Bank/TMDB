In 1989, war broke out between these countries, along and around the river. Both sides committed atrocities. Senegalese filmmaker Alassane Diago was just a young child at the time.  Now he brings together his “Senegalese and Mauritanian family,” all victims or witnesses of the bloodbath, so they can talk in detail about their traumatic experiences. He wants to find the truth, and to bring about reconciliation. Why did they slaughter each other, and why were so many people “deported”? Was there systemic racism involved, under the white and Arab elite? Was it a case of ethnic cleansing?","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/q52FkhAj0pKcG4WT4Jsvbjh7FEI.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15530,"logo_path":"/lmuCG8tJjtTueFouWvcig3OpwT1.png","name":"Les Films Hatari","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":148035,"logo_path":null,"name":"Indigo Mood Films","origin_country":"SN"},{"id":127455,"logo_path":"/g43BiHeXJvFibvuLFVT4zmpmYd9.png","name":"l’atelier documentaire","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":12340,"logo_path":"/cQXK6NL3b3jpX8tcPguGSmdtnu3.png","name":"ma.ja.de.
