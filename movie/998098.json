In 2013, the violent homophobic reactions of the supporters of the \"Manif pour tous\", which he hears from his balcony, make him fear to be targeted for the first time. That year, attacks against homosexuals increased sixfold. Gurwann Tran Van Gie explores the roots of homophobia as he looks back on his life. He presents the work of the association Contact Rhône, which tries to maintain or renew the dialogue between lesbians, gays, bisexuals, and their families. As for the association Le Refuge, it takes in underage homosexuals driven out by their parents, of which there are 1000 each year.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/gArJVM07A4Jmbs0SbEWcMt7Ej7f.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2017-12-04","revenue":0,"runtime":75,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Pourquoi nous détestent-ils, nous les homosexuels?","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
