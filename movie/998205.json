A group of African children are being instructed, by a voice off-camera, to chant phrases in Chinese. The kids repeat the words with smiles and enthusiasm - but they don't understand that what they're being told to say is \"I am a black monster and my IQ is low.\" The clip ignited outrage in China and beyond.
