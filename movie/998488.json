Boobyprize as Captain Dirk, and through some beaming laughter and hijinks he must rescue their fellow crewmember Dr. McRoy (Theodore) from the clutches of an extraterrestrial family. Bouncing back to Earth in the dark alleys of the big city, lurks the triumphant Caped Crimefighter Batmunk (Simon) who battles the mischievous Jokester played by Alvin. Through high-flying heroics Simon shows Alvin the value that crime doesn't pay. Finally, imagine shrinking grown-ups down to the size of a bug! In Funny...We Shrunk the Adults, Simon's experimental shrinking machine accidentally shrinks Dave and Ms. Miller and the boys have to pull together and clean up the GIANT mess they made.
