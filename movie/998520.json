At dawn, he yearns for his mother to carry him; at dusk, a bedtime story. She wished her young son would grow up quickly, just like she did: rushing gleefully into the adulthood once her training wheels came off.  She was in such a hurry to grow up, that she forgot what it was like to hold a chubby, sticky, grubby hand, and to cherish the time she had with her son, face to cheek, hand in hand.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/iGyujAfqBGa297fVJoThKuKFSer.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":178609,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stories Worth Telling","origin_country":""},{"id":123583,"logo_path":null,"name":"Viddsee","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"SG","name":"Singapore"}],"release_date":"2017-05-05","revenue":0,"runtime":9,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Time","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
