In the sinuous tangle of projective shadows, an observable process takes place. The emergent thermal beings not only compute a circular (convecting) current, but also briefly maintain this rotational circuit in a rhythmic equilibrium. Poised between liquid and gas states, the thermal beings form a coherent structure for an intense moment on the edge of chaos.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/rUNtkDJIQkc8hFSN1P3hmV5uQtf.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2014-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":28,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"A Teakettle’s Thermal Beings","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
