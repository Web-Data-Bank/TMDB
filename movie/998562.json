In comparison, injecting such a problem into an analog video signal is more clear-cut. That is, one can use electronic feedback to affect the image raster (its “frame”), collapsing the entire image-field in an elaborate morphogenetic display. However, with digital video, the destabilizing (and deterritorializing) of the frame is very indirect. Thus, instead of an electronic signal, “Indirect” uses a dataset of a turbulent phenomenon – in this case, the blowing wind. These changes in wind intensity, the continual flux of gusts and calm, are derived from a common computer-vision technique. The data output of this computer-vision analysis maps the wind’s turbulence onto moving fields of color.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/mgvwsadRzU7MiNLD6UE9ArBdsrD.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"2015-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":15,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Indirect","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
