They document a 400-mile trek by intrepid traveller and amateur filmmaker John C. Jewell, from the vale of Kashmir, via the Sind Valley, and the Lamayaru Monastry, 3.5 km above sea level. Along the way we see the Indus River, Spituk Gompa, Leh, Khardung La, and the Kangi gorge and pass. While the scenery is stunning, we also meet local people and get a taste of their culture, including a village dance.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vJHFPWCW7c42mg2qs7ZeN8gfuJN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"release_date":"1943-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":25,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ladakh","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
