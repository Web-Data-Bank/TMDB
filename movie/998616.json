To better define “Loss”, this project represents the Visayan’s narratives through the eyes of Typhoon Yolanda tragedy connecting it to the vanished Visayan Pintados Tattoo culture and Visayan Mythological creatures as a manifestation of loss and the invisible. These spiraling lost and vanished narratives are being reminisced and revisited as a representation of “Regeneration”.  The mural art portrays a grieving image of the typhoon tragedy that bridges us to the animated film which is the resolution of recovering and remembering.  Not losing sight of the time that was, a tribute for the lost and the forgotten is delivered through the film and the mural art.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/AaPvEP9p9KTliJItLIitEj47XEN.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"release_date":"","revenue":0,"runtime":3,"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Ilaw Ikaw","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
