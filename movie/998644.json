In 1965, the Colonial British authorities declared the isle separate from Mauritius in exchange of its independence. Then, the United States rented Diego Garcia, the largest of the isles, to install a military base and the population was sent to Mauritius. The Chagossians have spent the past 36 years living in extreme poverty in Mauritius, dreaming of one day going home.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/j6iHjqSWJ0tkrrZUpfzZgGMTLIW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":109700,"logo_path":"/n8F7DsdQJ4h4EZMXvmIsAxB5ZrN.png","name":"Caméléon Production","origin_country":"MU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"MU","name":"Mauritius"}],"release_date":"2002-01-01","revenue":0,"runtime":52,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Diego, The Forbidden Island","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
