Glances meet in a library. At a workout, two men discuss where to buy love. A couple kisses intimately. She bites him. No sooner has he bought a match than a better offer calls. Doubts arise. A couple explains themselves in therapy. At breakfast, his match chews her egg so loud that he freezes in disgust. The electrifying looks in the library lose their power. Full of hope they wander into the unknown. Only the dance makes them temporarily forget who they are and what will happen.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/vmnhDEGoeMQOgRkDgXuJBlWND0O.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"release_date":"2022-08-03","revenue":0,"runtime":20,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Heart Fruit","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
