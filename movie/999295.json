At the core of the threats to the planet - wars, overpopulation, pollution, and the depletion of natural resources - is the inadequacy of the nation state to come to terms with the surmounting problems of twentieth century living. What is urgently needed is the kind of international cooperation where nation states relinquish part of their sovereignty to a world body entrusted with the management of mankind's future.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/l4V6S7rAITRP82EIV1mxCDVYjLb.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":17,"logo_path":"/7Qu05UOqxdTGLl3kOvkRBv723Vz.png","name":"Warner Bros.
