Believing that \"a man is measured by his enemies\", Harry Maloney (Colm Meany) sets out to ruin George O'Flaherty – the most powerful man in town, who not only owns the local pub and most of the businesses in the area, but is also the local matchmaker. When Harry's son Gus (Cillian Murphy) – upon whom Harry regularly heaps abuse (mostly mental and verbal) – falls for the lovely Eileen, George helps get the two together. During this time, Harry quietly mobilizes his dastardly plans.","popularity":1.38,"poster_path":"/8eELHgTY2j1jodHApO23jOTSV0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":393,"logo_path":"/48DbAqzDc1ivGZrwGG2UAR70c0W.png","name":"MACT Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":850,"logo_path":"/aF7qajGJGtMpdrtvssM9g90YanX.png","name":"Eurimages","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":1898,"logo_path":"/8ix6SGlJiyuUDxLBtY8E0PY2G7w.png","name":"Screen Ireland","origin_country":"IE"},{"id":10102,"logo_path":"/b0g4aEM39p0PwbIiaU1Cg3ZZUAq.png","name":"Cattleya","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":10379,"logo_path":null,"name":"Film and General Productions","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":104,"logo_path":"/9aotxauvc9685tq9pTcRJszuT06.png","name":"Canal+","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":114831,"logo_path":null,"name":"Paradox Pictures","origin_country":"IE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"IE","name":"Ireland"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"release_date":"2002-03-01","revenue":0,"runtime":100,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"How Harry Became a Tree","video":false,"vote_average":5.4,"vote_count":14}
