It's created as a parody of a horror movie where plastic plays the role of evil. The character of sexy and blonde doll Garbie (Garbage+Barbie) lost her way in the haunted forest. Plastic bags emerge from the darkness like ghosts; toothbrushes, straws and bottles grow instead of trees, and a variety of other horror cliches are waiting for her ahead.","popularity":0.6,"poster_path":"/1wKoI1IRuoN9nBj3YDiByrzhFMX.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"UA","name":"Ukraine"}],"release_date":"2020-09-07","revenue":0,"runtime":5,"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Ukrainian","iso_639_1":"uk","name":"Український"}],"status":"Released","tagline":"","title":"Wrapped in Plastic","video":false,"vote_average":0.0,"vote_count":0}
