Part 4 Reverse Shot","overview":"A prospective wish is announced at the very beginning: \"Imagine a land without ownership\". Ownership? Since when? How? Where? With which implications? This is what Marwa Arsanios endeavours to discover in the fourth part of her meticulous ongoing project whose generic title is Who Is Afraid of Ideology? After documenting feminist experiments of community autonomy in Lebanon, Kurdistan and Syria (Who Is Afraid of Ideology? I&II, FID 2019), Marwa Arsanios ventures a hypothesis in the form of speculative fiction, from a remote piece of land in Lebanon, a cut in a stone quarry. In this small piece of land, a few sidekicks make that postulate, and slowly share stories of domination and exploitation. This land has a complicated administrative, legal, geological and biological history.
