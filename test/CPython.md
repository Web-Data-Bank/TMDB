To optimize the provided Python code by leveraging C/C++ extensions, you can use the `Cython` library. Cython allows you to write Python code that gets compiled to C, resulting in improved performance. Here's an example of how you can use Cython to optimize the given code:

1.  First, install the Cython library if you haven't already. You can use pip to install it:

    ```bash    
    pip install cython
    ```
    
2.  Create a new file called `download_api.pyx` with the following content:

    ```python
    # cython: language_level=3
    import os
    from requests import get

    def Download_API(str id):
        if not os.path.exists("alternative_titles/" + id + ".json"):
            url = "https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/" + id + "/alternative_titles?api_key=ed0646253701d7550481764a488b6ded"
            with get(url, timeout=10) as response:
                content = response.content
                with open("../alternative_titles/" + id + ".json", "wb") as file:
                    file.write(content)
    ```

3.  Create a new file called `main.py` with the following content:

    ```python
    from __future__ import division
    from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor, as_completed
    import sys
    from download_api import Download_API

    file_path = '../file_names.txt'

    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        movies_id = [line.strip() for line in file]

    num_tasks = len(movies_id)
    print(num_tasks)

    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=250) as executor:
        futures = [executor.submit(Download_API, id) for id in movies_id]
        for i, _ in enumerate(as_completed(futures), 1):
            sys.stderr.write('\rdone {0:%}'.format(i/num_tasks))

    ```
    
4.  Create a new file called `setup.py` with the following content:

    ```python
    from setuptools import setup
    from Cython.Build import cythonize

    setup(
        ext_modules=cythonize("download_api.pyx")
    )
    ```
    
5.  Open the terminal and navigate to the directory containing these three files. Then, run the following command to build the Cython extension:

    ```bash
    python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace
    ```
    This will generate a compiled C file (`download_api.c`) and a shared library file (e.g., `download_api.so` on Linux) from the Cython code.
    
6.  Finally, run the program using the following command:
    
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
    
    The program will execute with improved performance due to the utilization of the compiled Cython extension.
    

By leveraging Cython to compile critical sections of the code, you can achieve performance improvements closer to that of C/C++ while still benefiting from the high-level productivity and ease of use of Python.
